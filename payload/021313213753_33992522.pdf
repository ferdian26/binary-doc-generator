T*(conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. Lupton gathered 35Â men from )Tj
T*(Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans near the )Tj
T*(mouth of Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, )Tj

T*(Prairie Lake is diverted into the canal west to Keene Creek Reservoir, about 16 )Tj
T*(miles \(26Â km\) east of Ashland. Nearby Hyatt Reservoir also provides water. It )Tj
T*(is then piped through the mile long Cascade Tunnel to the Greensprings Power )Tj
T*(Plant, which generates about 18 megawatts of power. Afterward, the water is )Tj
T*(conveyed from the power plant 2 miles \(3Â km\) through the Greensprings Tunnel )Tj
T*(into Emigrant Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek. An average of approximately )Tj
T*(38,620 acre feet \(47,640,000Â m3\) of water flows through the tunnel. The water )Tj
T*(eventually ends up in Emigrant Lake, about 8 miles \(10Â km\) southeast of )Tj
T*(Ashland, where it either continues along Bear Creek, or is diverted for )Tj

T*( [edit] Butte Creek Mill )Tj
T*( The Butte Creek Mill, originally named Snowy Butte Mill, was built in 1872 on )Tj
T*(the banks of Little Butte Creek about 5.5 miles \(8.9Â km\) from its mouth. A )Tj
T*(diversion dam was built in the 1880s to provide water for the turbine that )Tj
T*(powers the mill. This dam has been rated as the fifth worst fish barrier in the )Tj
T*(watershed. In 2005, the Rogue Basin Fish Access Team built a $250,000 concrete )Tj
T*(fish ladder to allow fish past the dam. A small weir made of boulders was built )Tj
T*(at the base of the ladder, creating a 9-inch \(20Â cm\) jump between the creek and )Tj
T*(the ladder; however, the boulders were washed away in a severe storm just three )Tj
T*(months later, making the distance between them over 24 inches \(61Â cm\). The weir )Tj
T*(was rebuilt in 2008 for about $122,500. This time, it was built with concrete )Tj
T*(instead of boulders. )Tj
T*( The mill is now included on the National Register of Historic Places, and is )Tj
T*(the only gristmill in Oregon to still grind flour. It is also the oldest )Tj
T*(water-powered gristmill west of the Mississippi River. )Tj

T*(typical creek, scouring the stream bed down to bedrock and creating an )Tj
T*(unsuitable habitat for wild salmon. In 2007, a plan to divert the creek back )Tj
T*(into its old meanders was proposed. The $700,000 project involved building )Tj
T*(engineered riffles and log jams and adding boulders, extending the creek by )Tj
T*(approximately 3,500 feet \(1,100Â m\). It was completed in September 2011. )Tj
T*( [edit] Pollution )Tj
T*( The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality \(DEQ\) has monitored Little )Tj
T*(Butte Creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality: )Tj
T*(temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants )Tj
T*(such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed )Tj
T*(the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the )Tj
T*(Clean Water Act. About 40Â percent of the streams in the Little Butte Creek )Tj
T*(watershed were listed on the 2002 DEQ 303d list. The entire main stem exceeded )Tj
T*(the standard level for temperature, oxygen saturation, fecal coliforms )Tj
T*(\(bacteria\), and turbidity. The lower 6.5 miles \(10Â km\) of the North Fork were )Tj
T*(listed for high temperature and elevated levels of Escherichia coli, while the )Tj
T*(upper region was affected by chlorophyll a and pH levels. The South Fork was )Tj
T*(listed for turbidity and temperature. )Tj
T*( Overall, high temperature is the most common problem in the Little Butte Creek )Tj
T*(watershed. This is most likely caused by depleted riparian zones and water )Tj
T*(diversion. Approximately 53Â percent of riparian zones in the watershed are )Tj
T*(depleted due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43Â percent are classified )Tj
T*(as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, )Tj
T*(which provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very )Tj
T*(harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue. In )Tj
T*(2003, the Little Butte Creek Watershed Council rated the health of the Little )Tj
T*(Butte Creek watershed on a scale of 1 \(slightly degraded\) to 5 \(severely )Tj
T*(degraded\). Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. )Tj
T*( On the Oregon Water Quality Index \(OWQI\) used by DEQ, water quality scores can )Tj
T*(vary from 10 \(worst\) to 100 \(ideal\). The average for Little Butte Creek at RM )Tj
T*(1.4 \(RK 2.3\) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 \(poor\) in the summer and 82 \(fair\) in )Tj
T*(the fall, winter, and spring. )Tj
T*( [edit] Recreation )Tj
T*( The Little Butte Creek watershed contains several points of interest. Popular )Tj
T*(activities in and around Fish Lake include fishing, swimming, and boating. Two )Tj
T*(campgrounds are on the banks of the lake: Doe Point and the Fish Lake Resort. )Tj
T*(Several trails in the area lead to the much larger Pacific Crest Trail. Two )Tj
T*(snowparks are on Oregon Route 140. )Tj
T*( The Eagle Point Golf Course is in the watershed, built in 1995 by the world )Tj
T*(renowned golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Another course, Stone )Tj
T*(Ridge Golf Course, is near Agate Lake. The Butte Creek Mill and the Antelope )Tj
T*(and Lost Creek covered bridges are also popular attractions. Several historic )Tj
T*(structures can be found in Eagle Point, including the Eagle Point Museum, built )Tj
T*(in 1925 as the Long Mountain School, and the Walter Wood House, constructed in )Tj

T*(second half of the 20th century. Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at )Tj
T*(St. Dominic's. He was a regular and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper )Tj
T*(\(B.O.P.\), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's )Tj
T*(business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a classic History of )Tj
T*(the Old English Letter Foundries. )Tj
T*( Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a successful London printer who later became )Tj
T*(a Member of Parliament \(MP\). Talbot attended the City of London School before )Tj
T*(leaving at 17 to join the family business at the Fann Street type foundry. His )Tj
T*(literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were )Tj
T*(staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily )Tj
T*(involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing as a )Tj
T*(vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers, )Tj
T*(such as Dean Farrar, who did. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive )Tj
T*(understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable )Tj
T*(characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. )Tj
T*(He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre. )Tj
T*( In 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the Fann )Tj
T*(Street foundry. By then he had begun his monumental Letter Foundries history )Tj
T*(which, published in 1887, was hailed as the standard work on the subject. Along )Tj
T*(with his B.O.P. obligations Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for )Tj
T*(his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was busy elsewhere, )Tj
T*(as a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society, as )Tj
T*(a deacon in his local church, and as a trustee for his family's charities. All )Tj
T*(this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for )Tj
T*(most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes )Tj
T*(honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work )Tj
T*(as the definitive historian of English typefounding. )Tj
T*( [edit] Family background )Tj
T*( The Reeds were descended from John Reed, a colonel in Oliver Cromwell's army )Tj
T*(during the English Civil War. The family was based in Maiden Newton in the )Tj
T*(county of Dorset before moving to London at the end of the 18th century. Talbot )Tj
T*(Reed's grandfather, Andrew Reed \(1787â€“1862\), was a minister of the )Tj
T*(Congregational Church and the founder of several charitable institutions, )Tj
T*(including the London Orphan Asylum and a hospital for the incurably sick. He )Tj
T*(was also a hymn-writer of repute; his "Spirit Divine, attend our prayers" is )Tj
T*(still found in several 20th and 21st century hymnals.[1][n 1] )Tj
T*( Andrew Reed had five sons, the third of whom, Charles Reed \(1819â€“81\), was )Tj
T*(apprenticed in 1836 to a wool manufacturer in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also )Tj
T*(became secretary of the local Sunday School union. Through this work he met )Tj
T*(Edward Baines, proprietor of the Leeds Mercury one of the town's two MPs. The )Tj
T*(Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of )Tj
T*(Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, Matthew Talbot )Tj
T*(Baines, eventually reaching Cabinet rank.[3] Charles Reed was attracted to the )Tj
T*(youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By )Tj
T*(this time Charles had left the wool industry and returned to London, where he )Tj
T*(founded his first business, a printing firm.[1] )Tj
T*( The family settled in the London district of Hackney where Charles was active )Tj
T*(in public and religious affairs, with a particular interest in education. He )Tj
T*(became a member, and later chairman, of the London School Board, and helped to )Tj
T*(establish the Congregational Church Board of Education. From 1868 to 1881 he )Tj
T*(was one of Hackney's MPs. He also raised a family of five sons, the third of )Tj
T*(whom, named Talbot Baines after his distinguished uncle, was born at the family )Tj
T*(home, "Earlsmead", on 3 April 1852. Over the years, Charles expanded his )Tj
T*(business interests, and by 1861 had prospered sufficiently to acquire the )Tj
T*(Thorowgood type foundry in Fann Street, City of London.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Talbot Baines Reed grew up in a happy household, dominated by Charles Reed's )Tj
T*(religious zeal and his belief that hardy outdoor sports were the best means for )Tj
T*(bringing up boys.[1] This atmosphere of "simple, cheerful Puritanism" was, )Tj
T*(according to a friend, "eminently suited to [Talbot's] character and )Tj

T*(disposition".[4] Talbot began his education at Priory House School, Clapton,[5] )Tj
T*(and in 1864 became a day pupil at the City of London School, a relatively new )Tj
T*(foundation that had been established in Milk Street, Cheapside, in 1837.[6] )Tj
T*(Talbot's eldest brother, Charles junior, had been notably successful there, as )Tj
T*(captain of the school and a leading figure in its cricket and football teams. )Tj
T*(Talbot soon made his own mark, particularly on the sporting field; a )Tj
T*(contemporary describes him as "full of life and vigourÂ ... his strength of )Tj
T*(muscle, length of limb, boldness of attack, absolute fearlessness and )Tj
T*(perfection of nerve always made him conspicuous". Reed later showed some )Tj
T*(reticence about his academic achievements, asserting that one of his few )Tj
T*(successes was winning "the comfortable corner desk near the fire", reserved for )Tj
T*(the bottom place in Mathematics. In fact, in keeping with the school's record )Tj
T*(of producing men of letters and language scholars, Reed had excellent results )Tj
T*(in French, Greek and Latin, and had competed for the Sixth Form Latin prize. )Tj
T*(One of his school contemporaries was Herbert Henry Asquith, the future British )Tj
T*(prime minister. Reed and Asquith were participants in a sixth form debate on )Tj
T*(the motion that "the execution of Mary Queen of Scots was unjustifiable".[7] )Tj
T*( Despite evidence of considerable academic ability, Reed did not follow his )Tj
T*(brother Charles, who went on from the school to Trinity College, Cambridge. )Tj
T*(Instead, in 1869, Reed left the school to join the family firm at the Fann )Tj
T*(Street foundry, beginning the association with the printing trade that would )Tj
T*(continue for the rest of his life. He found time, however, to pursue many other )Tj
T*(interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice he walked the 53 miles )Tj
T*(\(85Â km\) from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and )Tj
T*(arriving at St John's College for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent )Tj
T*(swimmer, and won a Royal Humane Society medal for saving a cousin from drowning )Tj
T*(in rough seas.[7] He was an accomplished pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink )Tj
T*(illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were )Tj
T*(put to service in the production of a family magazine, The Earlsfield )Tj
T*(Chronicle, which Reed edited \(and largely wrote\) from the mid-1870s. The )Tj
T*(magazine circulated only among the extended Reed family, and included serious )Tj
T*(articles \("Is total abstinence a moral duty?"\) alongside comic verses and )Tj
T*(cartoons.[7][8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Printer and typefounder )Tj
T*( Although Reed would later jokingly describe his work for the family firm as )Tj
T*("drudgery",[9] in reality he was enthusiastic about the trade and worked hard )Tj
T*(to master it. Early in his career he met the leading printer and bibliographer )Tj
T*(of the day, William Blades, from whom he acquired a lasting fascination with )Tj
T*(the printing and typefounding crafts.[10] While still relatively inexperienced, )Tj
T*(Reed was asked by Blades to help organise a major exhibition to mark the 400th )Tj
T*(anniversary of William Caxton's printing of The Game and Playe of the Chesse. )Tj
T*(This was thought to be the first book printed in England, and the exhibition )Tj
T*(was originally planned for 1874. However, Blades's research proved that )Tj
T*(Caxton's first printing in England had in fact been in 1477, of a different )Tj
T*(book, so the quatercentenary celebrations were rescheduled accordingly.[11] The )Tj
T*(exhibition was held during the summer of 1877, at South Kensington, and was )Tj
T*(opened by William Gladstone, the former and future prime minister.[12] It )Tj
T*(included displays of Caxton's printed works, together with many examples of )Tj
T*(printing through the intervening years. Reed's main contribution was to the )Tj
T*(exhibition's catalogue, for which he wrote an essay entitled "The Rise and )Tj
T*(Progress of Typography and Type-Founding in England". The exhibition was )Tj
T*(supported by leading London printers, publishers, booksellers, antiquarians and )Tj
T*(scholars, and attracted wide public interest.[13][14] )Tj
T*( Sir Charles Reed, who had been knighted on Gladstone's recommendation in 1874, )Tj
T*(died in 1881. A few months later, Talbot's elder brother Andrew retired from )Tj
T*(the business because of ill health. As a result, at the age of 29, Talbot )Tj
T*(became the sole managing director of the Fann Street business, a position he )Tj
T*(held until his death.[15] This was, however, by no means Reed's sole activity )Tj
T*(in connection with the trade. In 1878, in response to a suggestion from Blades, )Tj
T*(he had begun work on a general history of typefounding in England, a task which )Tj

T*(occupied him intermittently for ten years. Published by Elliot Stock in 1887 )Tj
T*(under the title of History of the Old English Letter Foundries, the book became )Tj
T*(the standard text on the subject.[4] Its 21 chapters are illustrated throughout )Tj
T*(with examples of typefaces and symbols used for four centuries. The text is )Tj
T*(presented in modern style, but with the initial letter of each chapter ornately )Tj
T*(drawn from a 1544 pattern.[16][n 2] Also in 1887 Reed produced a revised and )Tj
T*(enlarged specimen book for the Fann Street foundry, with many new typeface )Tj
T*(designs and artistic ornamentations.[15] As an acknowledged expert in his )Tj
T*(field, Reed was in demand as a lecturer to learned societies. Among the papers )Tj
T*(he delivered were "Old and New Fashions in Typography", to the Royal Society of )Tj
T*(Arts in 1890, and "On the Use and Classification of a Typographical Library", )Tj
T*(to the Library Association in 1892.[18] After Blades's death in 1890, Reed )Tj
T*(prepared his former mentor's unfinished Pentateuch of Printing for publication, )Tj
T*(adding a long memorial tribute to Blades.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Boy's Own Paper )Tj
T*( The Reed family had longstanding connections with The Religious Tract Society )Tj
T*(\(RTS\), which had been founded in 1799 to publish and disseminate material of a )Tj
T*(Christian nature.[19] Talbot's grandfather Andrew Reed, at the age of 12, had )Tj
T*(attended the Society's inaugural meeting; Charles Reed and his eldest son, )Tj
T*(Charles junior, were both active members.[4] On 23 July 1878 an RTS )Tj
T*(subcommittee \(including both Charles Reeds\) recommended the publication of "a )Tj
T*(magazine for Boys to be issued weekly at a price of one penny".[20] Although )Tj
T*(the Society had frequently expressed a desire to counter the "cheap and )Tj
T*(sensational" magazines that were read by young people, its main committee was )Tj
T*(initially hesitant about this proposal, fearing its financial implications. )Tj
T*(Finally, however, it felt obliged "to attempt an enterprise from which others )Tj
T*(shrank".[20] Thereafter the committee moved swiftly, and the first issue of the )Tj
T*(new publication, The Boy's Own Paper, was on sale on 18 January 1879.[21] )Tj
T*( Although at that time his writing experience was limited, Reed was asked by )Tj
T*(his father and brother to contribute to the new venture, a challenge he )Tj
T*(accepted enthusiastically.[22] Apart from his stories for The Earlsfield )Tj
T*(Chronicle, his sole prior experience of magazine writing had been an article )Tj
T*(entitled "Camping Out", for the Edinburgh-based young peoples' magazine Morning )Tj
T*(of Life. This account of a boating excursion on the Thames had appeared in )Tj
T*(1875.[23] For the first issue of the B.O.P., Reed wrote a school story, "My )Tj
T*(First Football Match" which, accompanied by a half-page illustration, appeared )Tj
T*(on the front page "by An Old Boy". The story was very well received, and )Tj
T*(prompted demands for more about "Parkhurst", the school where the football )Tj
T*(match was played. Reed responded with several more tales, among which were "The )Tj
T*(Parkhurst Paper Chase" and "The Parkhurst Boat Race".[24] )Tj
T*( In the new magazine's first year Reed was a regular contributor of articles )Tj
T*(and stories on a range of subjects, joining distinguished writers such as G. A. )Tj
T*(Henty,[25]R.M. Ballantyne and Jules Verne.[24] A prominent illustrator for the )Tj
T*(magazine was the artist and mountaineer Edward Whymper.[26] Reed's association )Tj
T*(with the B.O.P. lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the )Tj
T*(initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This )Tj
T*(commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English )Tj
T*(Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book )Tj
T*(reviews for the Leeds Mercury,[4] now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward )Tj
T*(Baines.[27] )Tj
T*( The 1880s was a decade of growing prosperity, and increasing numbers of )Tj
T*(families from the expanding middle classes were sending their sons to boarding )Tj
T*(schools. B.O.P. editor George Hutchison felt that such schools would provide )Tj
T*(the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero \(or heroes\) could display )Tj
T*(Christian principles and strength of character in the face of temptations, and )Tj
T*(planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a )Tj
T*(boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However, the skill )Tj
T*(and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced )Tj
T*(Hutchinson that Reed should be given the assignment.[28] )Tj

T*( Reed's first response to the request for school stories for The Boy's Own )Tj
T*(Paper was The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch, which ran for 19 instalments )Tj
T*(from October 1880 to April 1881. The travels of a schoolboy's pocket watch are )Tj
T*(charted through school, university and, finally, India at the time of the )Tj
T*(Indian Rebellion of 1857.[29] The school, "Randlebury", is believed to be )Tj
T*(based, like "Parkhurst", on information Reed received from friends who had )Tj
T*(boarded at Radley.[30] The success of the story encouraged the B.O.P.'s editors )Tj
T*(to ask Reed to attempt a longer and more ambitious work. The result was The )Tj
T*(Fifth Form at St. Dominic's, which became the favourite and most influential of )Tj
T*(all Reed's stories.[31] Extended over 38 episodes, each a self-contained unit )Tj
T*(within an overall plot, this was the first of a sequence of school stories, all )Tj
T*(serialised in the B.O.P. The boarding school milieu was repeated, with a few )Tj
T*(variations, in The Willoughby Captains \(serialised 1883â€“84\), The Master of the )Tj
T*(Shell \(1887â€“88\), The Cock-House at Fellsgarth \(1891\)[n 3] and Tom, Dick and )Tj
T*(Harry \(1892â€“93\). Reed followed the suggestion of his editors by setting My )Tj
T*(Friend Smith \(1882â€“83\) in a different kind of school, a "modest establishment )Tj
T*(for the backward and troublesome".[32] It was, however, the boarding school )Tj
T*(stories that endured and which became the standard model for school stories for )Tj
T*(many decades.[33] All the serials were quickly issued in book form, and most )Tj
T*(were reprinted for the benefit of successive generations of boys, up to the )Tj
T*(1950s.[4] The model was imitated or copied by other writers for the next half )Tj
T*(century; according to historian Isabel Quigly, "Reed was a better writer than )Tj
T*(his followers, and has been diminished by their imitations."[34] )Tj
T*( In a biographical sketch written in 2004, historian Jeffrey Richards )Tj
T*(characterises Reed's work as a mixing of the earlier school story traditions )Tj
T*(established by Dean Farrar and Thomas Hughes, crafted with a vivid )Tj
T*(readability.[4] Reed dismissed Farrar's Eric, or, Little by Little as a )Tj
T*(religious tract thinly disguised as a school story, and sought to produce )Tj
T*(something more "manly".[31] Many of the incidents and characterisations )Tj
T*(introduced by Reed in St. Dominic's became standard elements in his subsequent )Tj
T*(stories, and in those of his imitators. Quigly lists among other recurrent )Tj
T*(features the stolen exam paper, the innocent who is wrongly accused and )Tj
T*(ultimately justified after much proud suffering, the boating accident, the )Tj
T*(group rivalries, the noble friendships. Adult characters are largely )Tj
T*(stereotypes: a headmaster known as "the Doctor" and modelled on Thomas Arnold )Tj
T*(of Rugby, "the jabbering French master \(pointed beard and two-tone shoes\)", the )Tj
T*(popular games master, the dry pedant, the generally comic domestic staff.[35] )Tj
T*(Reed established a tradition in which the fictional boarding school was peopled )Tj
T*(by such characters and was almost invariably represented in terms of "dark )Tj
T*(passages, iron bedsteads, scratched desks, chill dormitories and cosy, shabby )Tj
T*(studies.[36] Quigly suggests that one reason for the success of Reed's stories )Tj
T*(and their longlasting appeal is that they are not so much books about school as )Tj
T*(books about people.[37] John Sime of the RTS, in a memorial tribute to Reed )Tj
T*(after his death, notes that the boys in the stories are recognisably of flesh )Tj
T*(and blood, with "just that spice of wickedness ... without which a boy is not a )Tj
T*(boy".[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Personal life and other activities )Tj
T*( In 1876 Reed married Elizabeth Greer, the daughter of Samuel Greer, a County )Tj
T*(Court judge and former MP for the County of Londonderry in the north of )Tj
T*(Ireland. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy, but three healthy )Tj
T*(children followed: Charles in 1879, Margaret in 1882 and Talbot in 1886.[39] )Tj
T*(The connection with Ireland was of great value to Reed, and the family )Tj
T*(regularly spent annual holidays on the shores of Lough Swilly in County )Tj
T*(Donegal.[40] )Tj
T*( Reed was constantly busy; he held the loaferâ€”defined by him as "anyone who )Tj
T*(worked from nine to five and did nothing with the rest of the day"â€”in )Tj
T*(contempt.[9] Alongside his heavy schedule of duties at the foundry and his )Tj
T*(prolific writing, he took his share in the supervision of the various charities )Tj
T*(founded by his grandfather Andrew Reed, and was a deacon at his local )Tj
T*(Congregational Church.[39] In 1892 he was a co-founder of the Bibliographical )Tj

T*(Society and its first honorary secretary, an office he modestly agreed to hold )Tj
T*("pro tem in the hopes of your finding a better man".[41] )Tj
T*( Physically active and energetic, Reed keenly followed his old school's )Tj
T*(fortunes on the sports field, on one occasion writing anxiously to the school )Tj
T*(about its apparent loss of enthusiasm for football and cricket.[7] As part of a )Tj
T*(busy social life he regularly attended City of London Old Boys' reunion )Tj
T*(dinners, and was a member of two London clubs, the Savile and the Reform. In )Tj
T*(politics Reed was a lifelong Liberal, although he disagreed with Gladstone's )Tj
T*(Irish Home Rule policy.[42] Reed's busy and fulfilling life was punctuated from )Tj
T*(time to time by private tragedies. The loss of his baby daughter was followed, )Tj
T*(soon after, by the death of his younger brother Kenneth, drowned with a )Tj
T*(companion in Lough Allen in County Leitrim, while exploring the River Shannon. )Tj
T*(In 1883 his elder brother, The Rev. Charles Reed, "my 'father confessor' in )Tj
T*(times of all trouble", died after a fall during a walking holiday in )Tj
T*(Switzerland.[43] )Tj
T*( [edit] Death and legacy )Tj
T*( Reed generally enjoyed vigorous good health. However, early in 1893 there were )Tj
T*(signs that his workload was taking its toll. In January of that year he left )Tj
T*(London for an extended stay in Ireland, hoping to recover his energies. He )Tj
T*(returned to his various duties in May, but later in the summer became seriously )Tj
T*(ill with what was identified at the time as "consumption", and was probably )Tj
T*(pulmonary tuberculosis.[44][45] He relinquished the secretaryship of the )Tj
T*(Bibliographical Society and returned to Ireland where, though largely confined )Tj
T*(indoors, he continued writing his regular weekly column for the Leeds Mercury )Tj
T*(and finished his final novel, Kilgorman. Letters to friends at home indicated )Tj
T*(that he remained in good spirits and was hopeful of recovery.[46] However, his )Tj
T*(condition worsened, and he was advised to return home for urgent medical )Tj
T*(treatment. Back in London he wrote his final piece for the Mercury, a review of )Tj
T*(Seventy Years of Irish Life by W.R. Le Fanu. He died at his home in Highgate on )Tj
T*(28 November 1893, aged 41, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery, by the side )Tj
T*(of his father and grandfather.[44][47] )Tj
T*( Among the many tributes paid to Reed, Joseph Sime spoke for "the boys of the )Tj
T*(English-speaking world" who had "lost one of their best friends". Sime wrote of )Tj
T*(Reed's particular empathy with the young: "He possessed in himself the healthy )Tj
T*(freshness of heart of boyhoodÂ ... and could place himself sympathetically at )Tj
T*(the boy's standpoint in life."[38] Reed's grave was visited by boys and their )Tj

T*(resembles A.Â aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the )Tj
T*(false indusia are longer and the spores larger. )Tj
T*( Due to its limited distribution and similarity to other Adiantum species )Tj
T*(within its range, little is known of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, )Tj
T*(disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road )Tj
T*(cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and )Tj
T*(new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It is one of four species )Tj
T*(endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally )Tj
T*(threatened due to its habitat restrictions. )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Adiantum viridimontanum is a medium-sized, deciduous, terrestrial fern, about )Tj
T*(2 feet \(60Â cm\) wide and 1 to 2 feet \(30 to 60 cm\) high. Its fronds range from )Tj
T*(30 to 75 cm \(12 to 30 in\) in length from the base of the stem to the tip. Like )Tj
T*(many ferns, the frond of A.Â viridimontanum is divided into a series of )Tj
T*(leaflets, known as pinnae, and the pinnae are further divided into pinnules. )Tj
T*(The shape of the frond in A.Â pedatum, A.Â aleuticum, and A.Â viridimontanum is )Tj
T*(very similar. They are usually described as having a rachis that forks into two )Tj
T*(branches, which curve outwards and backwards. Several pinnae grow from the )Tj
T*(outer side of the curve of each rachis branch, with the longest pinnae located )Tj
T*(closest to the fork of the rachis. The fingerlike pinnae are pinnately divided )Tj
T*(into short-stalked pinnules. )Tj
T*( However, this interpretation of the frond architecture \(pedately divided into )Tj
T*(pinnae, then pinnately divided into pinnules\) presents a problem: no other )Tj
T*(species of Adiantum, nor any other member of the Polypodiaceae sensu lato \(the )Tj
T*(family in which Adiantum was once included\) has a forking rachis. In fact, )Tj
T*(these species are not pedate, but pseudopedate. What appears to be a fork in )Tj
T*(the rachis is in fact the junction between the rachis and a basal pinna. That )Tj
T*(basal pinna makes up one of the two curving branches; the rachis runs straight )Tj
T*(up the first fingerlike segment on the other branch, while the remainder of )Tj
T*(that curving branch is made up of the other basal pinna. Both basal pinnae are )Tj
T*(further divided and subdivided to create the other fingerlike segments. )Tj
T*(Therefore, even though they appear structurally similar, the longest and most )Tj
T*(central fingerlike segment represents the tip of the frond, pinnately divided )Tj
T*(into pinnae \(the first level of division of the frond\), while the two shorter )Tj
T*(fingerlike segments immediately on either side of it are pinnae, pinnately )Tj
T*(divided into pinnules \(the second level of division\). Each fingerlike segment )Tj
T*(thereafter represents a level of division one greater that the one that )Tj
T*(precedes it. Therefore, the final, pinnate subdivisions of each fingerlike )Tj
T*(segment may be referred to as "ultimate segments" to avoid the technical )Tj
T*(inaccuracy of calling them pinnules. )Tj
T*( The rhizome shows little branching, with intervals of 4.0 to 7.5Â mm between )Tj
T*(nodes. It measures 2.0 to 3.5Â mm in diameter. The rhizome and the stipe \(the )Tj
T*(part of the stem below the leaf\) have bronze-colored scales. The stipe and )Tj
T*(rachis range from chestnut brown to dark purple in color and are glabrous; the )Tj
T*(stipe is about 2 to 3Â mm in diameter while the rachis is smaller, 1 to 2Â mm. )Tj
T*(The basal pinnae are from three to seven times pinnate \(due to the pseudopedate )Tj
T*(structure of the blade\), while the apical parts of the blade \(and the )Tj
T*(corresponding segments of the basal pinnae\) are once-pinnate. The penultimate )Tj
T*(segments of the blade \(the apparent "pinnae", or fingerlike segments\) are )Tj
T*(typically lanceolate in shape. The overall arrangement of the penultimate )Tj
T*(segments ranges from drooping and fan-shaped on plants growing in the shade to )Tj
T*(funnel-shaped on plants growing in full sun; under the latter conditions, the )Tj
T*(segments stand stiffly erect. )Tj
T*( The ultimate segments of the divided blade \(the apparent "pinnules"\) are borne )Tj
T*(on short, dark stalks of 0.6 to 1.5Â mm, with the dark color often spreading )Tj
T*(into the base of each segment. They are long and obliquely triangular, the )Tj
T*(basiscopic margin forming the hypotenuse. The tip of the segments is typically )Tj
T*(acute, but entire \(not pointed\). They measure from 9.5 to 22.5Â mm in length and )Tj
T*(4.2 to 7.5Â mm in breadth, the average length being about 2.5 times the breadth. )Tj

T*(Their tissue is herbaceous \(firmly leafy\) to chartaceous \(parchment-like\) in )Tj
T*(texture, and bright green to bluish-green in color. As in other members of )Tj
T*(Adiantum, the glabrous leaves shed water when young. Under shady conditions, )Tj
T*(the ultimate segments lie within the plane of the blade, but tend to twist out )Tj
T*(of the plane when grown in the sun. The acroscopic margins of these segments )Tj
T*(are lobed, with narrow \(less than 1.0Â mm\) incisions lying between lobes. In )Tj
T*(fertile segments, these lobes are recurved to form false indusia beneath the )Tj
T*(leaf. These are transversely oblong, from 2 to 5Â mm in length and from 0.6 to )Tj
T*(1.4Â mm in width. )Tj
T*( The sporangia \(the fern's spore-bearing structures\) are borne on the underside )Tj
T*(of the leaf beneath the false indusium, a trait found in all members of )Tj
T*(Adiantum and not in any species outside it. The sori are round, and are found )Tj
T*(on veins ending in the false indusium, below the veins' ends. The spores are )Tj
T*(tetrahedral to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58Â micrometersÂ \(Î¼m\) )Tj

T*(pedatum complex. Spores appear in the summer and fall. The species has a )Tj

T*( [edit] Identification )Tj
T*( Adiantum viridimontanum closely resembles the other species in the A.Â pedatum )Tj
T*(complex \(A.Â pedatum and A.Â aleuticum\), and distinguishing the three in the )Tj
T*(field is difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted )Tj
T*(that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no )Tj
T*(single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. )Tj
T*(Sterile triploid hybrids between A.Â viridimontanum and the other two species )Tj
T*(may occur, further complicating field identification. )Tj
T*( One potentially distinguishing character is the shape of the ultimate segments )Tj
T*(in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A.Â pedatum and )Tj
T*(long-triangular or reniform \(kidney-shaped\) in A.Â viridimontanum and some )Tj
T*(specimens of A.Â aleuticum. Furthermore, A.Â viridimontanum can grow in both )Tj
T*(shade and sun, while A.Â pedatum grows in shade only. )Tj
T*( Adiantum viridimontanum can be separated from the morphologically similar )Tj
T*(individuals of A.Â aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial )Tj
T*(ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9Â mm and )Tj
T*(greater than 3.5Â mm, respectively, in A.Â viridimontanum. Spore size is also a )Tj
T*(useful character \(although not easily measured in the field\); the average A.Â )Tj
T*(viridimontanum spore measures 51.4Â Î¼m in diameter. While A.Â aleuticum spores )Tj
T*(can reach up to 53Â Î¼m, they average about 43Â Î¼m. In A.Â aleuticum growing as a )Tj
T*(disjunct on eastern serpentine \(the specimens most likely to be confused with )Tj
T*(A.Â viridimontanum\), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with )Tj
T*(intervals of 1.0 to 2.0Â mm between nodes. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( All species in the genus Adiantum are currently placed in the subfamily )Tj
T*(Vittarioideae of family Pteridaceae on the basis of molecular phylogenetic )Tj
T*(evidence. )Tj
T*( The work which led to the recognition of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct )Tj
T*(taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct )Tj
T*(specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A.Â pedatum var. )Tj
T*(aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon )Tj
T*(Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic )Tj
T*(outcrops elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified in Vermont by )Tj
T*(L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. )Tj
T*(Cody referred A.Â pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western )Tj
T*(North America, to A.Â pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the )Tj

T*(showed that A.Â pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, )Tj
T*(one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western )Tj
T*(mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the )Tj
T*(serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, )Tj
T*(including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, )Tj
T*(forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns )Tj
T*(suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern )Tj

T*(Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast )Tj
T*(DNA loci has revealed that the A.Â viridimontanum chloroplast genome most )Tj
T*(closely resembles that of A.Â aleuticum, suggesting that A.Â aleuticum was the )Tj
T*(maternal parent of A.Â viridimontanum. )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( Adiantum viridimontanum is narrowly distributed in New England and Quebec. )Tj
T*(Seven stations in Vermont lie in the Missisquoi Valley, in the northern Green )Tj
T*(Mountains, giving the fern its common name. The ultramafic rocks of this area )Tj
T*(extend northwards into Quebec, where eight stations are known in southern )Tj
T*(Quebec and six in the Thetford Mines area. It is also known from one station on )Tj
T*(serpentine on Deer Isle, Maine. )Tj
T*( The fern thrives in thin serpentine soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as )Tj
T*(roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic )Tj
T*(disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure in many of )Tj
T*(these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, )Tj
T*(both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and )Tj
T*(erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat. )Tj
T*( The eastern serpentine outcrops where A.Â viridimontanum thrives have )Tj
T*(relatively few endemics, compared to serpentine exposures globally. A.Â )Tj
T*(viridimontanum is one of only five taxa \(four species and a variety\) that are )Tj
T*(strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A.Â )Tj
T*(aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in )Tj
T*(North America. )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology )Tj
T*( Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by branching rather than )Tj
T*(sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores can result in sexual )Tj
T*(reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively )Tj
T*(short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal )Tj
T*(requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, )Tj
T*(typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow )Tj
T*(A.Â viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, )Tj
T*(where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The )Tj
T*(populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for )Tj
T*(low recruitment rates. )Tj
T*( Little is known about the role of A.Â viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In )Tj
T*(general, ferns are less susceptible to herbivory than flowering plants due to )Tj
T*(higher levels of toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.Â )Tj
T*(viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or )Tj
T*(disease. )Tj
T*( [edit] Conservation )Tj
T*( Under the NatureServe conservation status system, A.Â viridimontanum is )Tj
T*(considered globally vulnerable \(G3\). It is considered imperiled \(S2\) in Vermont )Tj
T*(and vulnerable \(S3\) in Quebec; it has not yet been classified in Maine. )Tj

T*( "Homer's Phobia" is the fifteenth episode of the eighth season of the American )Tj
T*(animated television series The Simpsons. It first aired on the Fox network in )Tj
T*(the United States on February 16, 1997. In this episode, Homer dissociates )Tj
T*(himself from new family friend John after discovering that John is gay. Homer )Tj
T*(fears that John will have a negative influence on his son Bart and decides to )Tj
T*(ensure Bart's heterosexuality by taking him hunting. )Tj
T*( It was the first episode written by Ron Hauge and was directed by Mike B. )Tj
T*(Anderson. George Meyer pitched "Bart the homo" as an initial idea for an )Tj
T*(episode while show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were planning an )Tj
T*(episode involving Lisa "discovering the joys of campy things". Oakley and )Tj
T*(Weinstein combined the two ideas and they eventually became "Homer's Phobia". )Tj
T*(Fox censors originally found the episode unsuitable for broadcast because of )Tj
T*(its controversial subject matter, but this decision was reversed after a )Tj
T*(turnover in the Fox staff. Filmmaker John Waters guest-starred, providing the )Tj
T*(voice of the new character, John. )Tj
T*( "Homer's Phobia" was the show's first episode to revolve entirely around gay )Tj
T*(themes and received a positive critical response both for its humor and )Tj
T*(anti-homophobia message. It won four awards, including an Emmy Award for )Tj
T*(Outstanding Animated Program \(For Programming One Hour or Less\) and a GLAAD )Tj
T*(Media Award for "Outstanding TV â€“ Individual Episode". )Tj
T*( Needing money to pay for the gas repair bill, the Simpson family visits )Tj
T*("Cockamamie's", an offbeat collectibles shop, hoping that it will purchase one )Tj
T*(of the family's heirlooms. Homer meets John, the antiques dealer, who explains )Tj
T*(that much of the merchandise is there because of its camp value. Bart and Lisa )Tj
T*(are impressed with John, and Homer invites him to the Simpsons' house to see )Tj
T*(the campy items that the family owns. The next morning, Homer tells Marge that )Tj
T*(he likes John and suggests they invite him and "his wife" over. Marge hints )Tj
T*(repeatedly to an oblivious Homer that John is gay, and when Homer finally )Tj
T*(understands, he is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely, )Tj
T*(and he turns against him, refusing to join his tour of Springfield. The rest of )Tj
T*(the family joins John and has a good time, but Homer is upset with the family )Tj
T*(upon their return. The rest of the Simpson family continue to enjoy John's )Tj
T*(company, especially Bart, who starts wearing Hawaiian shirts and dancing in a )Tj
T*(woman's wig. This makes Homer uneasy, and he begins to fear Bart is gay. )Tj
T*( Homer endeavors to make Bart more masculine by forcing him to look at a )Tj
T*(cigarette billboard featuring scantily clad women in hopes Bart will be )Tj
T*(attracted to girls, but instead Bart gets the urge to smoke "anything slim." )Tj
T*(Homer then escorts him to see a steel mill to show Bart a manly environment, )Tj
T*(however, much to his surprise and dismay, the entire workforce is gay, and )Tj
T*(during their breaks they turn the mill into The Anvil, a gay disco. A desperate )Tj
T*(Homer insists on taking Bart deer hunting with Moe and Barney. When they cannot )Tj
T*(find any deer, they decide instead to go to "Santa's Village" and shoot the )Tj
T*(reindeer in the corral, despite a tearful Bart being reluctant to do so. This )Tj
T*(backfires when the reindeer attack them. John, with the help of Lisa and Marge, )Tj
T*(uses a Japanese Santa Claus robot to scare off the reindeer and save the )Tj
T*(hunting party. Homer accepts John, more or less, and tells Bart, who is still )Tj
T*(unaware of his father's concerns, that any way he lives his life is fine with )Tj
T*(him. After Lisa informs Bart that Homer thinks he is gay, Bart is stunned. The )Tj

T*(written by George Meyer. One of them read "Bart the homo", and Ron Hauge was )Tj
T*(selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line.[5] The )Tj
T*(idea of using filmmaker John Waters as a guest star had been around for a )Tj
T*(while. Many of the staff were fans of his work, and showrunners Bill Oakley and )Tj
T*(Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode called "Lisa and Camp", )Tj
T*(which revolved around Lisa "discovering the joys of campy things".[6] Their )Tj
T*(idea was combined with Meyer's and it became this episode. The episode was )Tj
T*(originally titled "Bart Goes to Camp", but was renamed because the joke was too )Tj
T*(oblique.[5]Mike B. Anderson directed the episode, telling The Gold Coast )Tj
T*(Bulletin: "When I read the script I was enthralled, not only because of the )Tj
T*(visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was )Tj
T*(engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode."[7] )Tj
T*( Waters accepted his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating that if )Tj
T*(it was good enough for the actress Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared in the season )Tj
T*(four episodes "Lisa's First Word" and "Krusty Gets Kancelled", it was good )Tj
T*(enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character )Tj
T*(would be made to look like fitness personality Richard Simmons.[1] John's )Tj
T*(design was based largely on Waters' own appearance; for animation reasons, )Tj
T*(Waters moustache was changed from straight to curvy, so that it did not look )Tj
T*(like a mistake.[2][1] As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent )Tj
T*(Waters an animation cel from the episode which he now has hanging in his )Tj
T*(office.[8] )Tj
T*( According to Oakley, the Fox censor objected to "Homer's Phobia" being aired. )Tj
T*(The normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and )Tj
T*(then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted. )Tj
T*(However this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every )Tj
T*(single line in the show. The censors stated that they did not like the use of )Tj
T*(the word "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a )Tj
T*(paragraph which stated that "the topic and substance of this episode are )Tj
T*(unacceptable for broadcast". Usually the censor notes are ignored as the )Tj
T*(offending lines and problems are dealt with after the episode has been )Tj
T*(animated. In this case the entire episode was deemed a problem, so it could not )Tj
T*(be solved in this way.[6] The staff asked Waters if he thought the gay )Tj
T*(community would find the episode offensive. Homer's use of the word "fag" to )Tj
T*(insult John was his only problem, so the writers changed it to "queer".[9] The )Tj
T*(censor problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from )Tj
T*(animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and )Tj
T*(replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back )Tj
T*(merely one line: "acceptable for broadcast".[6] )Tj
T*( The "gay steel mill" scene was written by Steve Tompkins. He first pitched )Tj
T*(that Homer and Bart would encounter longshoremen, but it was too much work to )Tj
T*(animate the lading of ships, so a steel mill was used instead.[10] Tompkins )Tj
T*(also wrote a different third act for the episode which was never produced. )Tj
T*(Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at )Tj
T*("Santa's Village" they would go back to the steel mill. There, Homer would )Tj
T*(attempt to prove his heterosexuality by having a human tractor pulling contest )Tj
T*(with some of the steel mill workers. It was decided that it "didn't really )Tj
T*(service the story" and was dropped.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultural references )Tj
T*( The episode features numerous cultural references. The song "Gonna Make You )Tj
T*(Sweat \(Everybody Dance Now\)" by C+C Music Factory is played twice during the )Tj
T*(episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the )Tj
T*(closing credits.[4] Homer's record collection includes music by The New Christy )Tj
T*(Minstrels and The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson, the albums Loony Luau and )Tj
T*(Ballad of the Green Berets by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler.[3][4] The song that John )Tj
T*(picks out and he and Homer dance to is "I Love the Nightlife" by Alicia )Tj
T*(Bridges, and the song that Bart dances to is "The Shoop Shoop Song \(It's in His )Tj
T*(Kiss\)" by Betty Everett.[4] When John is introduced there is a plastic pink )Tj
T*(flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film Pink )Tj
T*(Flamingos.[3] Items in John's store include several buttons endorsing )Tj

T*( In its original American broadcast, "Homer's Phobia" finished tied for 47th )Tj
T*(place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 10â€“16, 1997 with a Nielsen )Tj
T*(rating of 8.7. It was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox Network that )Tj

T*(Programming One Hour or Less\) in 1997.[13] Mike Anderson won the Annie Award )Tj
T*(for Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a TV Production,[14] and the WAC )Tj
T*(Award for Best Director for Primetime Series at the 1998 World Animation )Tj

T*(Outstanding TV - Individual Episode.[17] Several of the episode's animation )Tj
T*(cels were selected for display at the Silver K Gallery in Melbourne, Australia )Tj
T*(in 2001.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reviews and analysis )Tj
T*( "Homer's Phobia" has been cited as a significant part of The Simpsons' )Tj
T*(exploration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \(LGBT\) themes.[18] The )Tj
T*(series made several references to homosexuality before the episode aired.[19] )Tj
T*(In the 1990 episode "Simpson and Delilah", the character Karl \(voiced by Harvey )Tj
T*(Fierstein\) kisses Homer, while the recurring character Waylon Smithers is often )Tj
T*(shown to be in love with his boss, Montgomery Burns, initially suggestively and )Tj
T*(since then more overtly.[20] However, "Homer's Phobia" was the first episode to )Tj
T*(revolve entirely around homosexual themes. Two later episodes that explored )Tj
T*(LGBT issues were "Three Gays of the Condo" and "There's Something About )Tj
T*(Marrying".[21] )Tj
T*( When the episode aired, the production team received "very few" complaints )Tj
T*(about its content, with most of the response being positive.[11] Alan Frutkin )Tj
T*(gave the episode a positive write-up in the LGBT-interest magazine The )Tj
T*(Advocate, calling it "vintage Simpsons."[22] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood )Tj
T*(stated in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated )Tj
T*(Unofficial Simpsons Guide, that: "Only The Simpsons could do this so )Tj
T*(tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good )Tj
T*(indeed."[4] In the book Leaving Springfield, Matthew Henry praised the )Tj
T*(episode's critiquing of "the most common misconception about homosexuality: )Tj
T*(namely that gayness is somehow contagious", as well as its other themes.[17] )Tj
T*(Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of )Tj
T*(good satire as it "managed to explore a lot of [homosexual] issues in quite a )Tj
T*(deep way [...] without being overtly political" which she claimed, along with )Tj
T*(the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that )Tj
T*(of other gay-themed shows like Queer as Folk.[23] In his review of The Simpsons )Tj
T*(- The Complete Eighth Season DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that "Homer's Phobia" )Tj
T*("certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes."[24] )Tj
T*( It was placed fifth on Entertainment Weekly's top 25 The Simpsons episode )Tj
T*(list.[25] In 2003, USA Today published a top 10 chosen by the webmaster of The )Tj
T*(Simpsons Archive, which had this episode listed in tenth place,[26] and it was )Tj
T*(again placed tenth on AskMen.com's "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" list.[27]IGN.com )Tj
T*(ranked John Waters's performance as the ninth best guest appearance in the )Tj
T*(show's history,[28] with TV Guide naming him the third best film related guest )Tj
T*(star.[29] In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Waters as one of the )Tj
T*(sixteen best Simpsons guest stars.[30] John Patterson of The Guardian wrote )Tj
T*(that Waters' appearance "felt to me like a summit meeting between the most )Tj
T*(influential pop-culture figures of the last 25 years."[31] )Tj
T*( In 2002, Off the Telly writers Steve Williams and Ian Jones named "Homer's )Tj

T*(intelligent design proponents were supported by the Discovery Institute, which, )Tj
T*(together with its Center for Science and Culture, planned and funded the )Tj
T*("intelligent design movement".[16][n 1] They advocated inclusion of intelligent )Tj
T*(design in public school biology curricula, leading to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. )Tj
T*(Dover Area School District trial, where U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III )Tj
T*(ruled that intelligent design is not science, that it "cannot uncouple itself )Tj
T*(from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents", and that the school )Tj
T*(district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the )Tj
T*(First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Origin of the concept )Tj
T*( The teleological argument, also known as the design argument, is one of three )Tj
T*(basic religious arguments for the existence of God which have been advanced for )Tj
T*(centuries \(the others being the ontological argument and the cosmological )Tj
T*(argument\). In the 13th century Thomas Aquinas argued that natural things act to )Tj
T*(achieve the best result, and as they cannot do this without intelligence, an )Tj
T*(intelligent being must exist, setting the goal and providing direction, and )Tj
T*(this being is God. The version formulated in 1802 by the theologian William )Tj
T*(Paley used the watchmaker analogy to argue that complexity and adaptation in )Tj
T*(nature demonstrated God's benevolent and perfect design, for the good of )Tj
T*(humans. Paley's natural theology strongly influenced scientists of the time, )Tj
T*(including Charles Darwin, who began with the assumption that God had designed )Tj
T*(nature and were open to a deistic interpretation that this design was )Tj
T*(implemented by laws. While Darwin's natural selection explained complexity and )Tj
T*(adaptation without the need for a designer, he was still inclined to think that )Tj
T*(everything resulted from designed laws,[18] by which Nature's God shaped life. )Tj
T*(Intelligent design has Paley's religious argument from design at its centre, )Tj
T*(but unlike Paley's openness to deistic design through God given laws, the point )Tj
T*(of intelligent design is to seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous )Tj
T*(interventions in the history of life.[19] )Tj
T*( By 1910 evolution was not a topic of major religious controversy in America, )Tj
T*(but in the 1920s Fundamentalist Christianity engaged in the )Tj
T*(Fundamentalistâ€“Modernist Controversy took up opposition to evolution,[19] and )Tj
T*(effectively suspended teaching of evolution in U.S. public schools. In the )Tj
T*(1960s, after evolution was reintroduced into the curriculum, Young Earth )Tj
T*(creationists promoted Creation Science as "an alternative scientific )Tj
T*(explanation of the world in which we live", which frequently invoked the design )Tj
T*(argument to explain complexity in nature. These explanations prefigured the )Tj
T*(intelligent arguments of irreducible complexity, even featuring the bacterial )Tj
T*(flagellum. Attempts to introduce this in schools led to court rulings that )Tj
T*(Creation Science is religious in nature, and thus cannot be taught in public )Tj
T*(school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science )Tj
T*(invoking Paley's religious argument from design. It shares other arguments with )Tj
T*(Creation Science but differs in avoiding overt literal Biblical references such )Tj
T*(as the age of the Earth and Noah's Flood.[14] )Tj
T*( Philosopher Barbara Forrest writes that the intelligent design movement began )Tj
T*(in 1984 with the publication by Jon A. Buell's the Foundation for Thought and )Tj
T*(Ethics of The Mystery of Life's Origin by Charles B. Thaxton, a chemist and )Tj
T*(creationist. Thaxton held a conference in 1988, "Sources of Information Content )Tj
T*(in DNA", which attracted creationists such as Stephen C. Meyer.[20] )Tj
T*( In March 1986, a review by Meyer used information theory to suggest that )Tj
T*(messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show "specified complexity" specified )Tj
T*(by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.[21] In )Tj

T*(in DNA conference in 1988 he said that his intelligent cause view was )Tj
T*(compatible with both metaphysical naturalism and supernaturalism.[23] )Tj

T*( [edit] Origin of the term )Tj
T*( The phrase "intelligent design" has been found in literature unrelated to the )Tj
T*(modern usage of the term.[26][27] While intelligent design proponents have )Tj
T*(pointed out examples, they have failed to show that these usages had any )Tj
T*(influence on those who instigated the intelligent design movement. The phrase )Tj
T*(did appear in explicitly creationist writings such as The Natural Limits to )Tj
T*(Biological Change published in 1984 by Lester and Bohlin. The creationist )Tj
T*(author A. E. Wilder-Smith has been cited as an influence by intelligent design )Tj
T*(proponents, and in a 1968 publication he argued that the mammary glands in )Tj
T*(whales could not have arisen by chance mutations, but were more plausibly the )Tj
T*(work of "an intelligent nipple designer". However, the first place that the )Tj
T*(term was systematically used, defined in a glossary and claimed to be other )Tj
T*(than creationism was in the 1989 textbook Of Pandas and People.[26][28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Of Pandas and People )Tj
T*( The modern use of the words "intelligent design" as a term intended to )Tj
T*(describe a field of inquiry began after the Supreme Court of the United States )Tj
T*(ruled in the case of Edwards v. Aguillard \(1987\) that creationism is )Tj
T*(unconstitutional in public school science curricula.[29] )Tj
T*( A Discovery Institute report says that Charles Thaxton, editor of Of Pandas )Tj
T*(and People, had picked the phrase up from a NASA scientist, and thought "That's )Tj
T*(just what I need, it's a good engineering term".[30] In drafts of the book over )Tj
T*(one hundred uses of the root word "creation", such as "creationism" and )Tj
T*("Creation Science", were changed, almost without exception, to "intelligent )Tj
T*(design",[15] while "creationists" was changed to "design proponents" or, in one )Tj
T*(instance, "cdesign proponentsists" [sic].[29] In June 1988 Thaxton held a )Tj
T*(conference titled "Sources of Information Content in DNA" in Tacoma, )Tj
T*(Washington,[23] and in December decided to use the label "intelligent design" )Tj
T*(for his new creationist movement.[31]Stephen C. Meyer was at the conference, )Tj
T*(and later recalled that "the term came up".[32] )Tj
T*( Of Pandas and People was published in 1989, and was the first book to make )Tj
T*(frequent use of the phrases "intelligent design", "design proponents", and )Tj
T*("design theory", thus representing the beginning of the modern "intelligent )Tj
T*(design" movement.[33] "Intelligent design" was the most prominent of around )Tj
T*(fifteen new terms it introduced as a new lexicon of creationist terminology to )Tj
T*(oppose evolution without using religious language.[34] It was the first place )Tj
T*(where the phrase "intelligent design" appeared in its present use, as stated )Tj
T*(both by its publisher Jon Buell,[14][35] and by William A. Dembski in his )Tj
T*(expert witness report.[36] )Tj
T*( The National Center for Science Education has criticized the book for )Tj
T*(presenting all of the basic arguments of intelligent design proponents and )Tj
T*(being actively promoted for use in public schools before any research had been )Tj
T*(done to support these arguments.[33] Although presented as a scientific )Tj
T*(textbook, Philosopher of science Michael Ruse considers the contents "worthless )Tj
T*(and dishonest". An ACLU lawyer described it as a political tool aimed at )Tj
T*(students who did not "know science or understand the controversy over evolution )Tj
T*(and creationism." One of the authors of the science framework used by )Tj

T*(interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of )Tj
T*(any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning".[37] )Tj
T*( Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap )Tj
T*(consists of several interacting piecesâ€”the base, the catch, the spring and the )Tj
T*(hammerâ€”all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any )Tj
T*(one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates )Tj
T*(assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, )Tj
T*(because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. )Tj
T*(Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the )Tj
T*(bacterial flagellum of E. coli, the blood clotting cascade, cilia, and the )Tj
T*(adaptive immune system.[38][39] )Tj
T*( Critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the )Tj
T*(necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not )Tj
T*(have been added sequentially.[8] They argue that something that is at first )Tj
T*(merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change. )Tj
T*(Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts )Tj
T*(or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is )Tj
T*(sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy with scaffolding, )Tj
T*(which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it is complete and )Tj
T*(able to stand on its own.[n 8] Behe has acknowledged using "sloppy prose", and )Tj
T*(that his "argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof".[n 9] )Tj
T*(Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates of )Tj
T*(intelligent design; in the Dover trial, the court held that "Professor Behe's )Tj
T*(claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research )Tj
T*(papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large".[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Specified complexity )Tj
T*( In 1986 Charles Thaxton, a physical chemist and creationist, used the term )Tj
T*("specified complexity" from information theory when claiming that messages )Tj
T*(transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have )Tj
T*(originated with an intelligent agent.[21] The intelligent design concept of )Tj
T*("specified complexity" was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, )Tj
T*(philosopher, and theologian William Dembski.[40] Dembski, Research Professor of )Tj
T*(Philosophy and Director of the Center for Cultural Engagement at Southwestern )Tj
T*(Baptist Theological Seminary, states that when something exhibits specified )Tj
T*(complexity \(i.e., is both complex and "specified", simultaneously\), one can )Tj
T*(infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause \(i.e., that it was designed\) )Tj
T*(rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following )Tj
T*(examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. )Tj
T*(A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A )Tj
T*(Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified".[41] He states that details )Tj
T*(of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the "patterns" of )Tj
T*(molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as DNA. )Tj
T*( Dembski defines complex specified information \(CSI\) as anything with a less )Tj
T*(than 1 in 10150 chance of occurring by \(natural\) chance. Critics say that this )Tj
T*(renders the argument a tautology: complex specified information cannot occur )Tj
T*(naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes )Tj
T*(whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.[43][n 10][44] )Tj
T*( The conceptual soundness of Dembski's specified complexity/CSI argument has )Tj
T*(been widely discredited by the scientific and mathematical communities.[10][45] )Tj
T*(Specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other )Tj
T*(fields, as Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and Wesley Elsberry characterize )Tj
T*(Dembski's "explanatory filter" as eliminative, because it eliminates )Tj
T*(explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to )Tj
T*(design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific )Tj
T*(inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible )Tj
T*(explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.[46] )Tj
T*( Richard Dawkins, another critic of intelligent design, argues in The God )Tj
T*(Delusion that allowing for an intelligent designer to account for unlikely )Tj
T*(complexity only postpones the problem, as such a designer would need to be at )Tj
T*(least as complex.[47] Other scientists have argued that evolution through )Tj

T*( [edit] Fine-tuned Universe )Tj
T*( Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader )Tj
T*(teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on )Tj
T*(the fine-tuning of universal constants that make matter and life possible and )Tj
T*(which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the )Tj
T*(values of fundamental physical constants, the relative strength of nuclear )Tj
T*(forces, electromagnetism, and gravity between fundamental particles, as well as )Tj
T*(the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and Center )Tj
T*(for Science and Culture fellow Guillermo Gonzalez argues that if any of these )Tj
T*(values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically )Tj
T*(different, making it impossible for many chemical elements and features of the )Tj
T*(Universe, such as galaxies, to form.[49] Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent )Tj
T*(designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present )Tj
T*(to achieve that particular outcome. )Tj
T*( Scientists have generally responded that these arguments are poorly supported )Tj
T*(by existing evidence.[50][51]Victor J. Stenger and other critics say both )Tj
T*(intelligent design and the weak form of the anthropic principle are essentially )Tj
T*(a tautology; in his view, these arguments amount to the claim that life is able )Tj
T*(to exist because the Universe is able to support life.[52][53][54] The claim of )Tj
T*(the improbability of a life-supporting universe has also been criticized as an )Tj
T*(argument by lack of imagination for assuming no other forms of life are )Tj
T*(possible. Life as we know it might not exist if things were different, but a )Tj
T*(different sort of life might exist in its place. A number of critics also )Tj
T*(suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that )Tj
T*(calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence )Tj
T*(of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.[55] )Tj
T*( [edit] Intelligent designer )Tj
T*( Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally )Tj
T*(avoid identifying the intelligent agent \(or agents\) they posit. Although they )Tj
T*(do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly )Tj
T*(hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. )Tj
T*(Dembski, in The Design Inference, speculates that an alien culture could )Tj
T*(fulfill these requirements. Of Pandas and People proposes that SETI illustrates )Tj
T*(an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science )Tj
T*(Robert T. Pennock suggested the RaÃ«lian UFO religion as a real-life example of )Tj
T*(an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that "make[s] many of the same )Tj
T*(bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists".[56] The )Tj
T*(authoritative description of intelligent design,[n 11] however, explicitly )Tj
T*(states that the Universe displays features of having been designed. )Tj
T*(Acknowledging the paradox, Dembski concludes that "no intelligent agent who is )Tj
T*(strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the )Tj
T*(origin of life".[57] The leading proponents have made statements to their )Tj
T*(supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian god, to the )Tj
T*(exclusion of all other religions.[n 2][24] )Tj
T*( Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of )Tj
T*(critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear )Tj
T*(unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, )Tj
T*(Jerry Coyne asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for making vitamin C, )Tj
T*(but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" \(see pseudogene\) and why )Tj
T*(he or she would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, )Tj
T*(and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these )Tj
T*(species". Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and fauna on those )Tj
T*(islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are )Tj
T*(very different" as evidence that species were not placed there by a )Tj

T*(perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs )Tj
T*(from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do )Tj
T*(not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a )Tj
T*(parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can )Tj
T*(have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He )Tj
T*(says that "the argument for imperfection critically depends on a psychoanalysis )Tj
T*(of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would )Tj
T*(not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you )Tj
T*(specifically what those reasons are." This reliance on inexplicable motives of )Tj
T*(the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Phillip E. )Tj
T*(Johnson puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, )Tj
T*(giving the example that in his view AIDS was created to punish immorality and )Tj
T*(was not caused by HIV, but such motives cannot be tested by scientific )Tj
T*(methods.[59] )Tj
T*( Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question "What )Tj
T*(designed the designer?"[60] Intelligent design proponents say that the question )Tj
T*(is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.[n 12] Richard Wein )Tj
T*(counters that the unanswered questions an explanation creates "must be balanced )Tj
T*(against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. )Tj
T*(Invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings \(ourselves\) )Tj
T*(is little more than question-begging. The new question raised by the )Tj
T*(explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to )Tj
T*(answer".[44] Richard Dawkins sees the assertion that the designer does not need )Tj
T*(to be explained, not as a contribution to knowledge, but as a )Tj
T*(thought-terminating clichÃ©.[61][62] In the absence of observable, measurable )Tj
T*(evidence, the very question "What designed the designer?" leads to an infinite )Tj
T*(regression from which intelligent design proponents can only escape by )Tj
T*(resorting to religious creationism or logical contradiction.[63] )Tj
T*( [edit] Movement )Tj
T*( The intelligent design movement is a direct outgrowth of the creationism of )Tj
T*(the 1980s.[13] The scientific and academic communities, along with a U.S. )Tj
T*(federal court, view intelligent design as either a form of creationism or as a )Tj
T*(direct descendant that is closely intertwined with traditional )Tj
T*(creationism;[65][n 13][66][67][68][69] and several authors explicitly refer to )Tj
T*(it as "intelligent design creationism".[13][70][n 14][71][72] )Tj
T*( The movement is headquartered in the Center for Science and Culture \(CSC\), )Tj
T*(established in 1996 as the creationist wing of the Discovery Institute to )Tj
T*(promote a religious agenda[n 15] calling for broad social, academic and )Tj
T*(political changes. The Discovery Institute's intelligent design campaigns have )Tj
T*(been staged primarily in the United States, although efforts have been made in )Tj
T*(other countries to promote intelligent design. Leaders of the movement say )Tj
T*(intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the )Tj
T*(secular philosophy of naturalism. Intelligent design proponents allege that )Tj
T*(science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand the adoption )Tj
T*(of a naturalistic philosophy that dismisses out-of-hand any explanation that )Tj
T*(includes a supernatural cause. The overall goal of the movement is to "defeat )Tj

T*(Science and Culture.[73] Nearly all intelligent design concepts and the )Tj
T*(associated movement are the products of the Discovery Institute, which guides )Tj
T*(the movement and follows its wedge strategy while conducting its Teach the )Tj
T*(Controversy campaign and their other related programs. )Tj
T*( Leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements )Tj
T*(regarding intelligent design. In statements directed at the general public, )Tj
T*(they say intelligent design is not religious; when addressing conservative )Tj
T*(Christian supporters, they state that intelligent design has its foundation in )Tj
T*(the Bible.[n 16] Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms its )Tj
T*(Christian, evangelistic orientation: "Alongside a focus on influential )Tj
T*(opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our )Tj
T*(natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through )Tj
T*(apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new )Tj
T*(scientific evidences that support the faith, as well as to 'popularize' our )Tj
T*(ideas in the broader culture."[n 15] )Tj
T*( Barbara Forrest, an expert who has written extensively on the movement, )Tj
T*(describes this as being due to the Discovery Institute's obfuscating its agenda )Tj
T*(as a matter of policy. She has written that the movement's "activities betray )Tj
T*(an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design )Tj
T*(creationism, but the religious world-view that undergirds it".[74] )Tj
T*( [edit] Religion and leading proponents )Tj
T*( Although arguments for intelligent design are formulated in secular terms and )Tj
T*(intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer,[n 17] the majority )Tj
T*(of principal intelligent design advocates are publicly religious Christians who )Tj
T*(have stated that, in their view, the designer proposed in intelligent design is )Tj
T*(the Christian conception of God. Stuart Burgess, Phillip E. Johnson, William )Tj
T*(Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer are evangelical Protestants; Michael Behe is a )Tj
T*(Roman Catholic; and Jonathan Wells is a member of the Unification Church. )Tj
T*(Non-Christian proponents include David Klinghoffer, who is Jewish,[75]Michael )Tj
T*(Denton, who is agnostic,[76][77][78] and Muzaffar Iqbal, a Pakistani )Tj
T*(Muslim.[79][80] Phillip E. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by )Tj
T*(employing secular language in arguments that are carefully crafted to avoid )Tj
T*(overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately )Tj
T*(reintroducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson explicitly )Tj
T*(calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious )Tj
T*(motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified "as just )Tj
T*(another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message".[n 18] Johnson )Tj
T*(emphasizes that "the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of )Tj
T*(the discussion"; "after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific )Tj
T*(fact [...] only then can 'biblical issues' be discussed".[n 19] )Tj
T*( The strategy of deliberately disguising the religious intent of intelligent )Tj
T*(design has been described by William Dembski in The Design Inference.[81] In )Tj
T*(this work Dembski lists a god or an "alien life force" as two possible options )Tj
T*(for the identity of the designer; however, in his book Intelligent Design: The )Tj
T*(Bridge Between Science and Theology, Dembski states that "Christ is )Tj
T*(indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its practitioners don't have a )Tj
T*(clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be )Tj
T*(pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory )Tj
T*(can in the end only be located in Christ."[82] Dembski also stated, "ID is part )Tj
T*(of God's general revelation [...] Not only does intelligent design rid us of )Tj
T*(this ideology \(materialism\), which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my )Tj
T*(personal experience, I've found that it opens the path for people to come to )Tj
T*(Christ".[83] Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible's Gospel of John as the )Tj
T*(foundation of intelligent design.[24][n 16] )Tj
T*( Barbara Forrest contends such statements reveal that leading proponents see )Tj
T*(intelligent design as essentially religious in nature, not merely a scientific )Tj
T*(concept that has implications with which their personal religious beliefs )Tj
T*(happen to coincide.[n 20] She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent )Tj
T*(design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative Christian )Tj

T*( Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design )Tj
T*(movement. According to Thomas Dixon, "Religious leaders have come out against )Tj
T*(ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the )Tj
T*(teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin )Tj
T*(in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different )Tj
T*(Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the Vatican )Tj
T*(Observatory, the Jesuit astronomer George Coyne, condemned ID as a kind of )Tj
T*('crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer."[85]Hugh Ross of )Tj
T*(Reasons to Believe, a proponent of Old Earth creationism, believes that the )Tj
T*(efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical )Tj
T*(Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002 he wrote: "Winning the )Tj
T*(argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy )Tj
T*(origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the )Tj
T*(community of scientists and other scholarsâ€¦ The time is right for a direct )Tj
T*(approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, )Tj
T*(scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap."[86] )Tj
T*( Likewise, two of the most prominent Young Earth creationism organizations in )Tj
T*(the world have attempted to distinguish their views from intelligent design. )Tj
T*(Henry M. Morris of the Institute for Creation Research \(ICR\) wrote, in 1999, )Tj
T*(that ID, "even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It )Tj
T*(has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The )Tj
T*(reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method." According to )Tj
T*(Morris: "The evidence of intelligent designâ€¦ must be either followed by or )Tj
T*(accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be )Tj
T*(meaningful and lasting."[87] In 2002, Carl Wieland, then of Answers in Genesis )Tj
T*(\(AiG\), criticized design advocates who, though well-intentioned, "left the )Tj
T*(Bible out of it" and thereby unwittingly aided and abetted the modern rejection )Tj
T*(of the Bible. Wieland explained that "AiG's major 'strategy' is to boldly, but )Tj
T*(humbly, call the church back to its Biblical foundationsâ€¦ [so] we neither count )Tj
T*(ourselves a part of this movement nor campaign against it."[88] )Tj
T*( The unequivocal consensus in the scientific community is that intelligent )Tj
T*(design is not science and has no place in a science curriculum.[89] The U.S. )Tj
T*(National Academy of Sciences has stated that "creationism, intelligent design, )Tj
T*(and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of )Tj
T*(species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of )Tj
T*(science."[90] The U.S. National Science Teachers Association and the American )Tj
T*(Association for the Advancement of Science have termed it pseudoscience.[91] )Tj
T*(Others in the scientific community have denounced its tactics, accusing the ID )Tj
T*(movement of manufacturing false attacks against evolution, of engaging in )Tj
T*(misinformation and misrepresentation about science, and marginalizing those who )Tj
T*(teach it.[92] More recently, in September 2012, Bill Nye \("The Science Guy"\) )Tj
T*(warned that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in The )Tj
T*(United States.[93][94] )Tj
T*( Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in )Tj

T*( The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure )Tj
T*(to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have )Tj

T*(intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article )Tj

T*(written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The )Tj

T*(intelligence should be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed )Tj

T*(design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as )Tj
T*(legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both )Tj
T*(searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's )Tj
T*(abilities, parameters, or intentions \(which scientists do know when searching )Tj
T*(for the results of human intelligence\), as well as denying the very distinction )Tj
T*(between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex )Tj
T*(designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in )Tj
T*(nature.[n 34] )Tj
T*( Among a significant proportion of the general public in the United States, the )Tj
T*(major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with )Tj

T*(The Discovery Institute's "Teach the Controversy" campaign promotes intelligent )Tj
T*(design while attempting to discredit evolution in United States public high )Tj
T*(school science courses.[13][111][112][113][114][115] The scientific community )Tj

T*(theory is discredited, ID is confirmed." This same argument had been put )Tj
T*(forward to support creation science at the McLean v. Arkansas trial which found )Tj
T*(it was "contrived dualism", the false premise of a "two-model approach". Behe's )Tj
T*(argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against )Tj

T*(design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to be found, )Tj
T*(as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as supposed )Tj
T*(cases of irreducible complexity.[120] )Tj
T*( [edit] Theological issues )Tj
T*( The insistence of intelligent design on repeated miraculous interventions )Tj
T*(rather than designed laws raises theological difficulties for those who believe )Tj
T*(that God's design must be perfect and should not need such changes. The claim )Tj
T*(to be scientific implies that science can test religion, and the problem of )Tj
T*(evil raises the issue of a lack of miraculous intervention to reduce )Tj
T*(suffering.[19] Intelligent design proponents avoid the problem of poor design )Tj
T*(in nature by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection )Tj
T*(of the design, or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the )Tj
T*(best design they can, and may have unknowable motives for their actions.[59] )Tj
T*( [edit] God of the gaps )Tj
T*( Intelligent design has also been characterized as a God-of-the-gaps )Tj
T*(argument,[121] which has the following form: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(There is a gap in scientific knowledge.)Tj
T*(The gap is filled with acts of God \(or intelligent designer\) and therefore )Tj
T*(proves the existence of God \(or intelligent designer\).[121])Tj
T*(  A God-of-the-gaps argument is the theological version of an argument from )Tj
T*(ignorance. A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers )Tj
T*(outstanding questions with explanations \(often supernatural\) that are )Tj
T*(unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable )Tj
T*(questions.[122]Historians of science observe that the astronomy of the earliest )Tj
T*(civilizations, although astonishing and incorporating mathematical )Tj
T*(constructions far in excess of any practical value, proved to be misdirected )Tj
T*(and of little importance to the development of science because they failed to )Tj
T*(inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that drove the heavenly bodies )Tj
T*(across the sky.[123] It was the Greek civilization that first practised )Tj
T*(science, although not yet a mathematically oriented experimental science, but )Tj
T*(nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of natural experience without )Tj
T*(recourse to divine intervention.[124] In this historically motivated definition )Tj
T*(of science any appeal to an intelligent creator is explicitly excluded for the )Tj
T*(paralysing effect it may have on the scientific progress. )Tj
T*( [edit] Kitzmiller trial )Tj
T*( Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District was the first direct challenge )Tj
T*(brought in the United States federal courts against a public school district )Tj
T*(that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to )Tj
T*(evolution. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form )Tj
T*(of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the )Tj

T*( [edit] Reaction )Tj
T*( Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in )Tj
T*(his decision that: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an )Tj
T*(activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an )Tj
T*(activist Court. Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of )Tj
T*(an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest )Tj
T*(law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination )Tj
T*(drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. )Tj
T*(The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered )Tj
T*(against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this )Tj
T*(trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District )Tj
T*(deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its )Tj
T*(resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources."[127])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( As Jones had predicted, John G. West, Associate Director of the Center for )Tj
T*(Science and Culture at Discovery Institute, said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the )Tj
T*(spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian )Tj
T*(evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it )Tj
T*(won't work. He has conflated Discovery Institute's position with that of the )Tj
T*(Dover school board, and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the )Tj
T*(motivations of the scientists who research it."[128])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Newspapers have noted with interest that the judge is "a Republican and a )Tj
T*(churchgoer".[129][130][131][132] )Tj
T*( Subsequently, the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and )Tj
T*(conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future )Tj
T*(defeats in court. In the Spring of 2007 the University of Montana Law review )Tj
T*(published three articles.[133] In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G. West and )Tj
T*(Casey Luskin, all of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is )Tj
T*(a valid scientific theory, the Jones court should not have addressed the )Tj
T*(question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the Kitzmiller )Tj
T*(decision will have no effect at all on the development and adoption of )Tj
T*(intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory.[134] In )Tj
T*(the second Peter Irons responded, arguing that the decision was extremely well )Tj
T*(reasoned and spells the death knell for the intelligent design efforts to )Tj
T*(introduce creationism in public schools,[135] while in the third, DeWolf et al. )Tj
T*(answer the points made by Irons.[136] However, fear of a similar lawsuit has )Tj
T*(resulted in other school boards abandoning intelligent design "teach the )Tj

T*(About Religion in K-12 Public Schools in the United States, which included )Tj
T*(guidance that Creation Science or intelligent design should not be taught in )Tj
T*(science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent )Tj
T*(worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as \(and )Tj
T*(limited to\) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable )Tj
T*(evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well )Tj
T*(as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life )Tj
T*(represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is )Tj
T*(appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, )Tj
T*(however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of )Tj
T*(religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as )Tj
T*(more legitimate than others."[137] )Tj
T*( [edit] Status outside the United States )Tj
T*( [edit] Europe )Tj
T*( In June 2007 the Council of Europe's "Committee on Culture, Science and )Tj
T*(Education" issued a report, The dangers of creationism in education, which )Tj
T*(states "Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not )Tj
T*(based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are )Tj
T*(pathetically inadequate for science classes."[138] In describing the dangers )Tj
T*(posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as )Tj
T*("anti-science" and involving "blatant scientific fraud" and "intellectual )Tj
T*(deception" that "blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science" and links )Tj
T*(it and other forms of creationism to denialism. On October 4, 2007, the Council )Tj
T*(of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools )Tj
T*(should "resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than )Tj
T*(religion", including "intelligent design", which it described as "the latest, )Tj
T*(more refined version of creationism", "presented in a more subtle way". The )Tj
T*(resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight )Tj
T*(a belief, but to "warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as )Tj
T*(science".[139] )Tj
T*( In the United Kingdom, public education includes Religious Education as a )Tj
T*(compulsory subject, and there are many faith schools that teach the ethos of )Tj
T*(particular denominations. When it was revealed that a group called Truth in )Tj
T*(Science had distributed DVDs produced by the Discovery Institute affiliate )Tj
T*(Illustra Media[n 35] featuring Discovery Institute fellows making the case for )Tj
T*(design in nature,[140] and claimed they were being used by 59 schools,[141] the )Tj
T*(Department for Education and Skills \(DfES\) stated that "Neither creationism nor )Tj
T*(intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools, and are not specified in )Tj
T*(the science curriculum" \(part of the National Curriculum, which does not apply )Tj
T*(to independent schools or to education in Scotland\).[142][143] The DfES )Tj
T*(subsequently stated that "Intelligent design is not a recognised scientific )Tj
T*(theory; therefore, it is not included in the science curriculum", but left the )Tj
T*(way open for it to be explored in religious education in relation to different )Tj
T*(beliefs, as part of a syllabus set by a local Standing Advisory Council on )Tj
T*(Religious Education.[144] In 2006 the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority )Tj
T*(produced a Religious Education model unit in which pupils can learn about )Tj
T*(religious and nonreligious views about creationism, intelligent design and )Tj
T*(evolution by natural selection.[145][146] )Tj
T*( On June 25, 2007, the UK Government responded to an e-petition by saying that )Tj
T*(creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as science, though )Tj

T*( The Bal des Ardents \(Ball of the Burning Men[1]\) or Bal des Sauvages[2] was a )Tj
T*(masquerade ball[note 1] held on 28Â January 1393 in Paris at which Charles VI of )Tj
T*(France performed in a dance with five members of the French nobility. Four of )Tj
T*(the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, )Tj
T*(Charles' brother Louis, Duke of OrlÃ©ans. Charles and another of the dancers )Tj
T*(survived. The ball was one of a number of events intended to entertain the )Tj
T*(young king, who in the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The )Tj
T*(event undermined confidence in Charles' capacity to rule; Parisians considered )Tj
T*(it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful )Tj
T*(members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the king and his brother )Tj
T*(OrlÃ©ans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and )Tj
T*(sorcery, into offering penance for the event. )Tj
T*( Charles' wife Queen Isabeau held the ball to honor the remarriage of a )Tj
T*(lady-in-waiting. Scholars believe it may have been a traditional charivari, )Tj
T*(with the dancers disguised as wild men, mythical beings often associated with )Tj
T*(demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in )Tj
T*(revels of Tudor England. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such )Tj
T*(as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated in a number of )Tj
T*(15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony )Tj
T*(of Burgundy. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( In 1380, after the death of his father Charles V of France, the 12-year-old )Tj
T*(Charles VI was crowned king, beginning his minority with his four uncles acting )Tj
T*(as regents.[note 2][3] Within two years one of them, Philip of Burgundy, )Tj
T*(described by historian Robert Knecht as "one of the most powerful princes in )Tj
T*(Europe",[4] became sole regent to the young king after Louis of Anjou pillaged )Tj
T*(the royal treasury and departed to campaign in Italy; Charles' other two )Tj
T*(uncles, John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon, showed little interest in )Tj
T*(governing.[3] In 1387, the 20-year-old Charles assumed sole control of the )Tj
T*(monarchy and immediately dismissed his uncles and reinstated the Marmousets, )Tj
T*(his father's traditional councilors. Unlike his uncles, the Marmousets wanted )Tj
T*(peace with England, less taxation, and a strong, responsible central )Tj
T*(governmentâ€”policies that resulted in a negotiated three-year truce with England )Tj
T*(and the Duke of Berry being stripped of his post as governor of Languedoc )Tj
T*(because of his excessive taxation.[5] )Tj
T*( In 1392 Charles suffered the first in a lifelong series of attacks of )Tj
T*(insanity, manifested by an "insatiable fury" at the attempted assassination of )Tj
T*(the Constable of France and leader of the Marmousets, Olivier de )Tj
T*(Clissonâ€”carried out by Pierre de Craon but orchestrated by John V, Duke of )Tj
T*(Brittany. Convinced that the attempt on Clisson's life was also an act of )Tj
T*(violence against himself and the monarchy, Charles quickly planned a )Tj
T*(retaliatory invasion of Brittany with the approval of the Marmousets, and )Tj
T*(within months departed Paris with a force of knights.[5][6] )Tj
T*( On a hot August day outside Le Mans, accompanying his forces on the way to )Tj
T*(Brittany, without warning Charles drew his weapons and charged his own )Tj
T*(household knights including his brother Louis I, Duke of OrlÃ©ansâ€”with whom he )Tj
T*(had a close relationshipâ€”crying "Forward against the traitors! They wish to )Tj
T*(deliver me to the enemy!"[7] He killed four men[8] before his chamberlain )Tj
T*(grabbed him by the waist and subdued him, after which he fell into a coma that )Tj
T*(lasted for four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of )Tj
T*(Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of the king's illness and quickly seized )Tj
T*(power, re-established themselves as regents, and dissolved the Marmouset )Tj
T*(council.[6] )Tj

T*(venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physicianâ€”was summoned to treat him. )Tj
T*(After Charles regained consciousness, and his fever subsided, he was returned )Tj
T*(to Paris by Harsigny, moving slowly from castle to castle, with periods of rest )Tj
T*(in between. Late in September Charles was well enough to make a pilgrimage of )Tj
T*(thanks to Notre Dame de Liesse near Laon after which he returned again to )Tj
T*(Paris.[6] )Tj
T*( The king's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger )Tj
T*(and punishment and by others as the result of sorcery;[6] modern historians )Tj
T*(such as Knecht speculate that Charles may have been experiencing the onset of )Tj
T*(paranoid schizophrenia.[5] Charles continued to be mentally fragile, believing )Tj
T*(he was made of glass, and according to historian Desmond Seward, running )Tj
T*("howling like a wolf down the corridors of the royal palaces".[9] Contemporary )Tj
T*(chronicler Jean Froissart wrote that the king's illness was so severe that he )Tj
T*(was "far out of the way; no medicine could help him".[9] During the worst of )Tj
T*(his illness Charles was unable to recognize his wife Queen Isabeau, demanding )Tj
T*(her removal when she entered his chamber, but after his recovery Charles made )Tj
T*(arrangements for her to hold guardianship of their children. She eventually )Tj
T*(became guardian to her sonâ€”the future Charles VII of Franceâ€”the Dauphin \(b. )Tj
T*(1397\), granting her great political power and ensuring a place on the council )Tj
T*(of regents in event of a relapse.[10] )Tj
T*( In A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century the historian Barbara Tuchman )Tj
T*(writes that the physician Harsigny, refusing "all pleas and offers of riches to )Tj
T*(remain",[11] left Paris and ordered the courtiers to shield the king from the )Tj
T*(duties of government and leadership. He told the king's advisors to "be careful )Tj
T*(not to worry or irritate himÂ .... Burden him with work as little as you can; )Tj
T*(pleasure and forgetfulness will be better for him than anything else."[1] To )Tj
T*(surround Charles with a festive atmosphere and to protect him from the rigor of )Tj
T*(governing, the court turned to elaborate amusements and extravagant fashions. )Tj
T*(Isabeau and her sister-in-law Valentina Visconti, Duchess of OrlÃ©ans, wore )Tj
T*(jewel-laden dresses and elaborate braided hairstyles coiled into tall shells )Tj
T*(and covered with wide double hennins that reportedly required doorways to be )Tj
T*(widened to accommodate them.[1] )Tj
T*( The common people thought the extravagances excessive yet loved their young )Tj
T*(king, whom they called Charles le bien-aimÃ© \(the well-beloved\). Blame for )Tj
T*(unnecessary excess and expense was directed at the foreign queen, who was )Tj
T*(brought from Bavaria at the request of Charles' uncles.[1] Neither Isabeau nor )Tj
T*(her sister-in-law Valentinaâ€”daughter of the ruthless Duke of Milanâ€”were well )Tj
T*(liked by either the court or the people.[8] Froissart wrote in his Chronicles )Tj
T*(that Charles' uncles were content to allow the frivolities because "so long as )Tj
T*(the Queen and the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans danced, they were not dangerous or even )Tj
T*(annoying".[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bal des Ardents and aftermath )Tj
T*( On 28Â January 1393, Isabeau held a masquerade at the HÃ´tel Saint-Pol to )Tj
T*(celebrate the third marriage of her lady-in-waiting, Catherine de )Tj
T*(Fastaverin.[2][note 3] Tuchman explains that a widow's remarriage was )Tj
T*(traditionally an occasion for mockery and tomfoolery, often celebrated with )Tj
T*(masquerades or charivari characterized by "all sorts of licence, disguises, )Tj
T*(disorders, and loud blaring of discordant music and clanging of cymbals".[13] )Tj
T*(On the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, whom Tuchman describes as well known for )Tj
T*(his "outrageous schemes" and cruelty, six high-ranking knights performed a )Tj
T*(dance in costume as wood savages. The costumes, which were sewn onto the men, )Tj
T*(were made of linen soaked with resin to which flax was attached "so that they )Tj
T*(appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot".[1] Masks made of the same )Tj
T*(materials covered the dancers' faces and hid their identities from the )Tj
T*(audience. Some chronicles report that the dancers were bound together by )Tj
T*(chains. Most of the audience were unaware that Charles was among the dancers. )Tj
T*(Strict orders forbade the lighting of hall torches and prohibited anyone from )Tj
T*(entering the hall with a torch during the performance, to minimize the risk of )Tj
T*(the highly flammable costumes catching fire.[1] )Tj
T*( According to historian Jan Veenstra the men capered and howled "like wolves", )Tj

T*(spat obscenities and invited the audience to guess their identities while )Tj
T*(dancing in a "diabolical" frenzy.[14] Charles' brother OrlÃ©ans arrived with )Tj
T*(Phillipe de Bar, late and drunk, and they entered the hall carrying lit )Tj
T*(torches. Accounts vary, but OrlÃ©ans may have held his torch above a dancer's )Tj
T*(mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell, setting fire to the dancer's )Tj
T*(leg.[1] In the 17th century, William Prynne wrote of the incident that "the )Tj
T*(Duke of OrleanceÂ ... put one of the Torches his servants held so neere the )Tj
T*(flax, that he set one of the Coates on fire, and so each of them set fire on to )Tj
T*(the other, and so they were all in a bright flame",[15] whereas a contemporary )Tj
T*(chronicle stated that he "threw" the torch at one of the dancers.[2] )Tj
T*( Isabeau, knowing that her husband was one of the dancers, fainted when the men )Tj
T*(caught fire. Charles, however, was standing at a distance from the other )Tj
T*(dancers, near his 15-year-old aunt Joan, Duchess of Berry, who swiftly threw )Tj
T*(her voluminous skirt over him to protect him from the sparks.[1] Sources )Tj
T*(disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the king aside )Tj
T*(to speak to him, or whether the king moved away toward the audience. Froissart )Tj
T*(wrote that "The King, who proceeded ahead of [the dancers], departed from his )Tj
T*(companionsÂ ... and went to the ladies to show himself to themÂ ... and so passed )Tj
T*(by the Queen and came near the Duchess of Berry".[16][17] )Tj
T*( The scene soon descended into chaos; the dancers shrieked in pain as they )Tj
T*(burned in their costumes, and the audience, many of them also sustaining burns, )Tj
T*(screamed as they tried to rescue the burning men.[1] The event was chronicled )Tj
T*(in uncharacteristic vividness by the Monk of St Denis, who wrote that "four men )Tj
T*(were burned alive, their flaming genitals dropping to the floorÂ ... releasing a )Tj
T*(stream of blood".[14] Only two dancers survived: the king, thanks to the quick )Tj
T*(reactions of the Duchess of Berry, and the Sieur de Nantouillet, who jumped )Tj
T*(into an open vat of wine and remained there until the flames were extinguished. )Tj
T*(The Count de Joigny died at the scene; Yvain de Foix and Aimery Poitiers, son )Tj
T*(of the Count of Valentinois, lingered with painful burns for two days. The )Tj
T*(instigator of the affair, Huguet de Guisay, survived a day longer, described by )Tj
T*(Tuchman as bitterly "cursing and insulting his fellow dancers, the dead and the )Tj
T*(living, until his last hour".[1] )Tj
T*( The citizens of Paris, angered by the event and at the danger posed to their )Tj
T*(monarch, blamed Charles' advisors. A "great commotion" swept through the city )Tj
T*(as the populace threatened to depose Charles' uncles and kill dissolute and )Tj
T*(depraved courtiers. Greatly concerned at the popular outcry and worried about a )Tj
T*(repeat of the Maillotin revolt of the previous decadeâ€”when Parisians armed with )Tj
T*(mallets turned against tax collectorsâ€”Charles' uncles persuaded the court to do )Tj
T*(penance at Notre Dame Cathedral, preceded by an apologetic royal progress )Tj
T*(through the city in which the king rode on horseback with his uncles walking in )Tj
T*(humility. OrlÃ©ans, who was blamed for the tragedy, donated funds in atonement )Tj
T*(for a chapel to be built at the Celestine monastery.[1][18] )Tj
T*( Froissart's chronicle of the event places blame directly on Charles' brother, )Tj
T*(OrlÃ©ans. He wrote: "And thus the feast and marriage celebrations ended with )Tj
T*(such great sorrowÂ ... [Charles] and [Isabeau] could do nothing to remedy it. We )Tj
T*(must accept that is was no fault of theirs but of the duke of OrlÃ©ans."[19] )Tj
T*(OrlÃ©ans' reputation was severely damaged by the event, compounded by an episode )Tj
T*(a few years earlier in which he was accused of sorcery after hiring an apostate )Tj
T*(monk to imbue a ring, dagger and sword with demonic magic. The theologian Jean )Tj
T*(Petit would later testify that OrlÃ©ans practiced sorcery, and that the fire at )Tj
T*(the dance represented a failed attempt at regicide made in retaliation for )Tj
T*(Charles' attack the previous summer.[20] )Tj
T*( The Bal des Ardents added to the impression of a court steeped in )Tj
T*(extravagance, with a king in delicate health and unable to rule. Charles' )Tj
T*(attacks of illness increased in frequency such that by the end of the 1390s his )Tj
T*(role was merely ceremonial. By the early 15th century he was neglected and )Tj
T*(often forgotten, a lack of leadership that contributed to the decline and )Tj
T*(fragmentation of the Valois dynasty.[21] In 1407, Philip the Bold's son, John )Tj
T*(the Fearless, had his cousin OrlÃ©ans assassinated because of "vice, corruption, )Tj
T*(sorcery, and a long list of public and private villainies"; at the same time )Tj

T*(Isabeau was accused of having been the mistress of her husband's brother.[22] )Tj
T*(OrlÃ©ans' assassination pushed the country into a civil war between the )Tj
T*(Burgundians and the OrlÃ©anists \(known as the Armagnacs\), which lasted for )Tj
T*(several decades. The vacuum created by the lack of central power and the )Tj
T*(general irresponsibility of the French court resulted in it gaining a )Tj
T*(reputation for lax morals and decadence that endured for more than 200 )Tj
T*(years.[23] The lover and favourite of Queen Isabeau, Louis de Bois-Bourdon, )Tj
T*(gave a deposition during his trial at which he told the court of how the Queen )Tj
T*(had confided in him before the event that she had conspired with her )Tj
T*(brother-in-law \(the king's brother\) to set fire to the king. Bois-Bourdon was )Tj
T*(drowned on the orders of Charles VI in 1417. Though Bois-Bourdon left a )Tj
T*(legitimate child, a daughter named Anna born in 1415 and married to Henri )Tj
T*(David, it is also possible that Charles VII is Bois-Bourdon's illegitimate )Tj
T*(son.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Folkloric and Christian representations of wild men )Tj
T*( Veenstra writes in Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France )Tj
T*(that the Bal des Ardents reveals the tension between Christian beliefs and the )Tj
T*(latent paganism that existed in 14th-century society. According to him, the )Tj
T*(event "laid bare a great cultural struggle with the past but also became an )Tj
T*(ominous foreshadowing of the future."[14] )Tj
T*( Wild men or savagesâ€”usually depicted carrying a staff or club, living beyond )Tj
T*(the bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and a )Tj
T*(soulâ€”were then a metaphor for man without God.[25] Common superstition held )Tj
T*(that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to )Tj
T*(conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such )Tj
T*(as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers )Tj
T*(dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then )Tj
T*(an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The Church, )Tj
T*(however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.[26][note 4] )Tj
T*( Veenstra explains that it was believed that by dressing as wild men, villagers )Tj
T*(ritualistically "conjured demons by imitating them"â€”although at that period )Tj
T*(penitentials forbade a belief in wild men or an imitation of them, such as the )Tj
T*(costumed dance at Isabeau's event. In folkloric rituals the, "burning did not )Tj
T*(happen literally but in effigie", he writes, "contrary to the Bal des Ardents )Tj
T*(where the seasonal fertility rite had watered down to courtly entertainment, )Tj
T*(but where burning had been promoted to a dreadful reality." A 15th-century )Tj
T*(chronicle describes the Bal des Ardents as una corea procurance demone \("a )Tj
T*(dance to ward off the devil"\).[27] )Tj
T*( Because remarriage was often thought to be a sacrilegeâ€”common belief was that )Tj
T*(the sacrament of marriage extended beyond deathâ€”it was censured by the )Tj
T*(community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain )Tj
T*(the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waitingâ€”in an )Tj
T*(inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike.[26] A )Tj
T*(ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian )Tj
T*(origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a )Tj
T*(woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually )Tj
T*(freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.[26][28] )Tj
T*( The event also may have served as a symbolic exorcism of Charles' mental )Tj
T*(illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by )Tj
T*(members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, )Tj
T*(demonic, or Satanic forces was not uncommon as shown by the Duke of OrlÃ©ans' )Tj
T*(later persecution of the king's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death )Tj
T*(after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Chronicles )Tj
T*( The death of four members of the nobility was sufficiently important to ensure )Tj
T*(that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by )Tj
T*(Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of )Tj
T*(copies of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on )Tj
T*(essential points of the eveningâ€”the dancers were dressed as wild men, the king )Tj

T*(discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained )Tj
T*(together, which is not mentioned in the Monk's account. Furthermore, the two )Tj
T*(chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the )Tj
T*(historian Susan Crane, the Monk describes the event as a wild charivari with )Tj
T*(the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description )Tj
T*(suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.[29] )Tj
T*( Froissart wrote about the event in Book IV of his Chronicles \(covering the )Tj
T*(years 1389 to 1440\), an account described by scholar Katerina Nara as full of )Tj
T*("a sense of pessimism", as Froissart "did not approve of all he recorded".[30] )Tj
T*(Froissart blamed OrlÃ©ans for the tragedy,[31] and the Monk blamed the )Tj
T*(instigator, de Guisay, whose reputation for treating low-born servants like )Tj
T*(animals earned him such universal hatred that "the Nobles rejoiced at his )Tj
T*(agonizing death".[32] )Tj
T*( The Monk wrote of the event in the Histoire de Charles VI \(History of Charles )Tj
T*(VI\), covering about 25 years of the king's reign.[33] He seemed to )Tj
T*(disapprove[note 5] on the grounds that the event broke social mores and the )Tj
T*(king's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart described it as a celebratory )Tj
T*(event.[29] )Tj
T*( Scholars are unsure whether either chronicler was present that evening. )Tj
T*(According to Crane, Froissart wrote of the event about five years later, and )Tj
T*(the Monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the Monk may have been an )Tj
T*(eyewitness \(as he was for much of Charles VI's reign\) and that his account is )Tj
T*(the more accurate of the two.[29][35] The Monk's chronicle is generally )Tj
T*(accepted as essential for understanding the king's court, however his )Tj
T*(neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-OrlÃ©anist )Tj
T*(stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner.[36] A )Tj
T*(third account was written in the mid-15th century by Jean Juvenal des Ursins in )Tj
T*(his biography of Charles, L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France, not )Tj
T*(published until 1614.[37] )Tj
T*( The Froissart manuscript dating from between 1470 and 1472 from the Harleian )Tj
T*(Collection held at the British Library includes a miniature depicting the )Tj
T*(event, titled "Dance of the Wodewoses", attributed to an unknown painter )Tj
T*(referred to as the Master of the Harley Froissart.[34] A slightly later edition )Tj
T*(of Froissart's Chronicles, dated to around 1480, contains a miniature of the )Tj
T*(event, "Fire at a Masked Dance", also attributed to an unidentified early )Tj
T*(Netherlandish painter known as the Master of the Getty Froissart.[38] The )Tj
T*(15th-century Gruuthuse manuscript of Froissart's Chronicles, held at the )Tj
T*(BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France, has a miniature of the event.[39] Another )Tj
T*(edition of Froissart's Chronicles published in Paris around 1508 may have been )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The first Ediacaran fossils discovered were the disc-shaped Aspidella )Tj
T*(terranovica in 1868. Their discoverer, Scottish geological surveyor Alexander )Tj
T*(Murray, found them useful aids for correlating the age of rocks around )Tj
T*(Newfoundland.[11] However since they lay below the "Primordial Strata", the )Tj
T*(Cambrian strata that were then thought to contain the very first signs of life, )Tj
T*(it took four years for anybody to dare propose they could be fossils. Elkanah )Tj
T*(Billings' proposal was dismissed by his peers on account of their simple form )Tj
T*(and they were instead declared gas escape structures, inorganic concretions, or )Tj
T*(even tricks played by a malicious God to promote unbelief.[11] No similar )Tj
T*(structures elsewhere in the world were then known and the one-sided debate soon )Tj
T*(fell into obscurity.[11] In 1933, Georg GÃ¼rich discovered specimens in )Tj
T*(Namibia[12] but the firm belief that life originated in the Cambrian led to )Tj
T*(them being assigned to the Cambrian Period and no link to Aspidella was made. )Tj
T*(In 1946 Reg Sprigg noticed "jellyfishes" in the Ediacara Hills of Australia's )Tj
T*(Flinders Ranges[13] but these rocks were believed to be Early Cambrian so, )Tj
T*(while the discovery sparked some interest, little serious attention was )Tj
T*(garnered. )Tj
T*( It was not until the British discovery of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the )Tj
T*(pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped )Tj
T*(fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest,[14] and due to the detailed )Tj
T*(geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt that )Tj
T*(these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. PalÃ¦ontologist Martin Glaessner )Tj
T*(finally, in 1959, made the connection between this and the earlier )Tj
T*(finds[15][16] and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens )Tj
T*(and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were )Tj
T*(recognised.[17] )Tj
T*( All specimens discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone that )Tj
T*(prevented preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. )Tj
T*(Misra's discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the Mistaken Point assemblage in )Tj
T*(Newfoundland changed all this as the delicate detail preserved by the fine ash )Tj
T*(allowed the description of features that were previously undiscernible.[18][19] )Tj
T*( Poor communication, combined with the difficulty in correlating globally )Tj
T*(distinct formations, led to a plethora of different names for the biota. In )Tj
T*(1960 the French name "Ediacarien"Â â€“ after the Ediacaran Hills in South )Tj
T*(Australia, which take their name from aborigine Idiyakra, "water is present"Â â€“ )Tj
T*(was added to the competing terms "Sinian" and "Vendian"[20] for )Tj
T*(terminal-Precambrian rocks, and these names were also applied to the )Tj
T*(life-forms. "Ediacaran" and "Ediacarian" were subsequently applied to the epoch )Tj
T*(or period of geological time and its corresponding rocks. In March 2004, the )Tj
T*(International Union of Geological Sciences ended the inconsistency by formally )Tj
T*(naming the terminal period of the Neoproterozoic after the Australian )Tj

T*(making their abundant preservation surprising. The absence of burrowing )Tj
T*(creatures living in the sediments undoubtedly helped.[22] After the evolution )Tj
T*(of these organisms in the Cambrian, soft-bodied impressions were usually )Tj
T*(disturbed before they could fossilize.[citation needed] )Tj
T*( [edit] Microbial mats )Tj
T*( Microbial mats are areas of sediment stabilised by the presence of colonies of )Tj
T*(microbes which secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. )Tj
T*(They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but )Tj
T*(this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, )Tj
T*(themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can )Tj
T*(grow or reproduce through it parts of the colony will die leaving behind )Tj
T*(fossils with a characteristically wrinkled \("elephant skin"\) and tubercular )Tj
T*(texture.[23] )Tj
T*( Some Ediacaran strata with the texture characteristics of microbial mats )Tj
T*(contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils are almost always found in beds that )Tj
T*(contain these microbial mats. Although microbial mats were once widespread, the )Tj
T*(evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian vastly reduced their )Tj
T*(numbers.[24] These communities are now limited to inhospitable refugia where )Tj
T*(predators cannot survive long enough to eat them, such as the stromatolites )Tj
T*(found in Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Shark Bay, Western Australia )Tj
T*(where the salt levels can be as high as 1.5 or 2 times the normal level of the )Tj
T*(surrounding sea.[citation needed] )Tj
T*( [edit] Fossilisation )Tj
T*( The preservation of these fossils is one of their great fascinations to )Tj
T*(science. As soft-bodied organisms they would normally not fossilise and, unlike )Tj
T*(later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen )Tj
T*(Limestone, the Ediacara biota is not found in a restricted environment subject )Tj
T*(to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that )Tj
T*(were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very )Tj
T*(different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to )Tj
T*(be left behind and it is thought that the fossils were preserved by virtue of )Tj
T*(rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats )Tj
T*(on which they lived.[25] Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be )Tj
T*(precisely dated to the nearest million years or better by means of radiometric )Tj
T*(dating.[26] However it is more common to find Ediacaran fossils under sandy )Tj
T*(beds deposited by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as )Tj
T*(turbidites.[25] Soft-bodied organisms today almost never fossilise during such )Tj
T*(events but the presence of widespread microbial mats probably aided )Tj
T*(preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Scale of preservation )Tj
T*( The rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of )Tj
T*(decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of )Tj
T*(an organism is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the )Tj
T*(overlying sediment was cemented, the ash or sand then slumped in to fill the )Tj
T*(void, leaving a cast of the underside of the organism. )Tj
T*( Conversely, quilted fossils tended to decompose after the cementation of the )Tj
T*(overlying sediment; hence their upper surfaces are preserved. Their more )Tj
T*(resistant nature is reflected in the fact that in rare occasions quilted )Tj
T*(fossils are found within storm beds as the high-energy sedimentation did not )Tj
T*(destroy them as it would have the less-resistant discs. Further, in some cases, )Tj
T*(the bacterial precipitation of minerals formed a "death mask" creating a mould )Tj
T*(of the organism.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Morphology )Tj
T*( The Ediacaran biota exhibited a vast range of morphological characteristics. )Tj
T*(Size ranged from millimetres to metres; complexity from "blob-like" to )Tj
T*(intricate; rigidity from sturdy and resistant to jelly-soft. Almost all forms )Tj
T*(of symmetry were present.[25] These organisms differed from earlier fossils by )Tj
T*(displaying an organised, differentiated multicellular construction and )Tj
T*(centimetre-plus sizes. )Tj

T*( "Embryos"Â )Tj
T*(Recent discoveries of Precambrian multicellular life have been dominated by )Tj
T*(reports of embryos, particularly from the Doushantuo Formation in China. Some )Tj
T*(finds[29] generated intense media excitement[30] though some have claimed they )Tj
T*(are instead inorganic structures formed by the precipitation of minerals on the )Tj
T*(inside of a hole.[31] Other "embryos" have been interpreted as the remains of )Tj
T*(the giant sulfur-reducing bacteria akin to Thiomargarita,[32] a view which is )Tj
T*(highly contested yet gradually gaining supporters.[33][34])Tj
T*(Microfossils dating from 632.5 million years agoÂ â€“ just 3Â million years after )Tj
T*(the end of the Cryogenian glaciationsÂ â€“ may represent embryonic 'resting )Tj
T*(stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals.[35] An alternative )Tj
T*(proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular )Tj
T*(organisms of this period.[36])Tj
T*( DiscsÂ )Tj
T*(Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to the )Tj
T*(initial identification of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria which include jellyfish )Tj
T*(and corals.[13] Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of )Tj
T*(all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. )Tj
T*(Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists;[37] the patterns )Tj
T*(displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as )Tj
T*(microbial colonies,[38][39] and yet others may represent scratch marks formed )Tj
T*(as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts.[40] Useful diagnostic )Tj
T*(characters are often lacking because only the underside of the organism is )Tj
T*(preserved by fossilization.)Tj
T*( BagsÂ )Tj
T*(Fossils such as Pteridinium preserved within sediment layers resemble )Tj
T*("mud-filled bags". The scientific community is a long way from reaching a )Tj
T*(consensus on their interpretation.[41])Tj
T*( ToroidsÂ )Tj
T*(The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata from the Nama Group, Namibia, has been )Tj
T*(interpreted as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large )Tj
T*(gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is in the shape of )Tj
T*(a flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the )Tj
T*(approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.[42])Tj
T*( Quilted organismsÂ )Tj
T*(The organisms considered in Seilacher's revised definition of the )Tj
T*(Vendobionta[7] share a "quilted" appearance and resembled an inflatable )Tj
T*(mattress. Sometimes these quilts would be torn or ruptured prior to )Tj
T*(preservation: such damaged specimens provide valuable clues in the )Tj
T*(reconstruction process. For example the three \(or more\) petaloid fronds of )Tj
T*(Swartpuntia germsi could only be recognised in a posthumously damaged specimenÂ )Tj
T*(â€“ usually multiple fronds were hidden as burial squashed the organisms flat.[43])Tj
T*( These organisms appear to form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the )Tj
T*(simpler erniettomorphs.[44] Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and )Tj
T*(Swartpuntia, the group is both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the )Tj
T*(most difficult to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, )Tj
T*(gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their )Tj
T*(lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted )Tj
T*(hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by )Tj
T*(osmotrophy [45] or osmosis.[46])Tj
T*( Non-Ediacaran EdiacaransÂ )Tj
T*(Some Ediacaran organisms have more complex details preserved which has allowed )Tj
T*(them to be interpreted as possible early forms of living phyla excluding them )Tj
T*(from some definitions of the Ediacaran biota.)Tj
T*(The earliest such fossil is the reputed bilaterian Vernanimalcula claimed by )Tj
T*(some, however, to represent the infilling of an egg-sac or acritarch.[31][47] )Tj

T*(Representatives of modern taxa existed in the Ediacaran, some of which are )Tj

T*(Trace fossilsÂ )Tj
T*(With the exception of some very simple vertical burrows[54]\(p186\)[55] the only )Tj
T*(Ediacaran burrows are horizontal, lying on or just below the surface. Such )Tj
T*(burrows have been taken to imply the presence of motile organisms with heads )Tj
T*(which would probably have had a bilateral symmetry. This could place them in )Tj
T*(the bilateral clade of animals[54] but they could also have been made by )Tj
T*(simpler organisms feeding as they slowly rolled along the sea floor.[56] )Tj
T*(Putative "burrows" dating as far back as 1,100 millionÂ years may have been made )Tj
T*(by animals which fed on the undersides of microbial mats which would have )Tj
T*(shielded them from a chemically unpleasant ocean;[57] however their uneven )Tj
T*(width and tapering ends make a biological origin so difficult to defend[58] )Tj
T*(that even the original proponent no longer believes they are authentic.[59])Tj
T*(The burrows observed imply simple behaviour, and the complex efficient feeding )Tj
T*(traces common from the start of the Cambrian are absent. Some Ediacaran )Tj
T*(fossils, especially discs, have been interpreted tentatively as trace fossils )Tj
T*(but this hypothesis has not gained widespread acceptance. As well as burrows, )Tj
T*(some trace fossils have been found directly associated with an Ediacaran )Tj
T*(fossil. Yorgia and Dickinsonia are often found at the end of long pathways of )Tj
T*(trace fossils matching their shape;[60] these fossils are thought to be )Tj
T*(associated with ciliary feeding but the precise method of formation of these )Tj
T*(disconnected and overlapping fossils largely remains a mystery.[61] The )Tj
T*(potential mollusc Kimberella is associated with scratch marks, perhaps formed )Tj
T*(by a radula.[62])Tj

T*( [edit] Cnidarians )Tj
T*( Since the most primitive eumetazoansâ€”multi-cellular animals with tissuesâ€”are )Tj
T*(cnidarians, the first attempt to categorise these fossils designated them as )Tj
T*(jellyfish and sea pens.[63] However, more recent discoveries have established )Tj
T*(that many of the circular forms formerly considered "cnidarian medusa" are )Tj
T*(actually holdfastsÂ â€“ sand-filled vesicles occurring at the base of the stem of )Tj
T*(upright frond-like Ediacarans. A notable example is the form known as )Tj
T*(Charniodiscus, a circular impression later found to be attached to the long )Tj
T*('stem' of a frond-like organism that now bears the name.[64][65] )Tj
T*( The link between certain frond-like Ediacarans and sea pens has been thrown )Tj
T*(into doubt by multiple lines of evidence; chiefly the derived nature of the )Tj
T*(most frond-like pennatulacean octocorals, their absence from the fossil record )Tj
T*(before the Tertiary, and the apparent cohesion between segments in Ediacaran )Tj
T*(frond-like organisms.[66] Some researchers have suggested that an analysis of )Tj
T*("growth poles" discredits the pennatulacean nature of Ediacaran fronds.[67][68] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Dawn of Animal Life )Tj
T*( Martin Glaessner proposed in The Dawn of Animal Life \(1984\) that the Ediacara )Tj

T*( In 1998 Mark McMenamin claimed that Ediacarans did not possess an embryonic )Tj
T*(stage, and thus could not be animals. He believed that they independently )Tj
T*(evolved a nervous system and brains, meaning that "the path toward intelligent )Tj
T*(life was embarked upon more than once on this planet", though this idea has not )Tj
T*(been widely accepted.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] New phylum )Tj
T*( Seilacher most famously suggested that the Ediacaran organisms represented a )Tj
T*(unique and extinct grouping of related forms descended from a common ancestor )Tj
T*(\(clade\) and created the kingdom Vendozoa,[71][72] named after the now-obsolete )Tj
T*(Vendian era. He later excluded fossils identified as metazoans and relaunched )Tj
T*(the phylum "Vendobionta". )Tj
T*( He described the Vendobionta as quilted cnidarians lacking stinging cells. )Tj
T*(This absence precludes the current cnidarian method of feeding, so Seilacher )Tj
T*(suggested that the organisms may have survived by symbiosis with photosynthetic )Tj
T*(or chemoautotrophic organisms.[73]Mark McMenamin saw such feeding strategies as )Tj
T*(characteristic for the entire biota, and referred to the marine biota of this )Tj
T*(period as a "Garden of Ediacara".[74] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lichens )Tj
T*( Gregory Retallack's hypothesis that Ediacaran organisms were lichens[75][76] )Tj
T*(is not widely accepted by the scientific community.[77][78] He argues that the )Tj
T*(fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish, and their relief is )Tj
T*(closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as )Tj
T*(compressed cylinders. He points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies )Tj
T*(would provide a similar resistance to compaction, and claims the large size of )Tj
T*(the organisms \(up to 1.5 metres long, far larger than any of the preserved )Tj
T*(burrows\) also hints against classification with animals. Finally, Ediacaran )Tj
T*(fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in )Tj
T*(growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols, interpreted as )Tj
T*(soils of well drained temperate desert soils.[76][79] Such habitats limit )Tj
T*(interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to )Tj
T*(lichenized or unlichenized fungi, but other Ediacaran fossils could have been )Tj
T*(slime molds or microbial colonies. )Tj
T*( [edit] Other interpretations )Tj
T*( Almost every possible phylum has been used to accommodate the Ediacaran biota )Tj
T*(at some point,[80] from algae,[81] to protists known as foraminifera,[82] to )Tj
T*(fungi[83] to bacterial or microbial colonies,[38] to hypothetical intermediates )Tj
T*(between plants and animals.[84] )Tj
T*( [edit] Origin )Tj
T*( It took almost 4Â billion years from the formation of the Earth for the )Tj
T*(Ediacaran fossils to first appear, 655Â million years ago. Whilst putative )Tj
T*(fossils are reported from 3,460 million years ago,[85][86] the first )Tj
T*(uncontroversial evidence for life is found 2,700 million years ago,[87] and )Tj
T*(cells with nuclei certainly existed by 1,200 million years ago:[88] The reason )Tj
T*(why it took so long for forms with an Ediacaran grade of organisation to appear )Tj
T*(is uncertain. )Tj
T*( It could be that no special explanation is required: the slow process of )Tj
T*(evolution simply required 4 billion years to accumulate the necessary )Tj
T*(adaptations. Indeed, there does seem to be a slow increase in the maximum level )Tj
T*(of complexity seen over this time, with more and more complex forms of life )Tj
T*(evolving as time progresses, with traces of earlier semi-complex life such as )Tj
T*(Nimbia, found in the 610 million year old Twitya formation,[89] \(and possibly )Tj
T*(older rocks dating to 770 million years ago[90]\) possibly displaying the most )Tj
T*(complex morphology of the time. )Tj
T*( The alternative train of thought is that it was simply not advantageous to be )Tj
T*(large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the )Tj
T*(small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose )Tj
T*(small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally )Tj
T*(abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, )Tj
T*(the environment would have to be very different indeed. )Tj

T*( A primary size-limiting factor is the amount of atmospheric oxygen. Without a )Tj
T*(complex circulatory system, low concentrations of oxygen cannot reach the )Tj
T*(centre of an organism quickly enough to supply its metabolic demand. )Tj
T*( On the early Earth, reactive elements such as iron and uranium existed in a )Tj
T*(reduced form, which would react with any free oxygen produced by )Tj
T*(photosynthesising organisms. Oxygen would not be able to build up in the )Tj
T*(atmosphere until all the iron had rusted \(producing banded iron formations\), )Tj
T*(and other reactive elements had also been oxidised. Donald Canfield detected )Tj
T*(records of the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before )Tj
T*(the first Ediacaran fossils appeared[91]Â â€“ and the presence of atmospheric )Tj
T*(oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation.[92] )Tj
T*(Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile )Tj
T*(\(stationary\) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with )Tj
T*(larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of )Tj
T*(oxygenation.[93] However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of )Tj
T*(atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia )Tj
T*(having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the )Tj
T*(Cretaceous.[94] )Tj
T*( Periods of intense cold have also been suggested as a barrier to the evolution )Tj
T*(of multicellular life. The earliest known embryos, from China's Doushantuo )Tj
T*(Formation, appear just a million years after the Earth emerged from a global )Tj
T*(glaciation, suggesting that ice cover and cold oceans may have prevented the )Tj
T*(emergence of multicellular life.[95] Potentially, complex life may have evolved )Tj
T*(before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in )Tj
T*(modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures )Tj
T*(increase or decrease the rate of evolution. )Tj
T*( In early 2008 a team analysed the range of basic body structures \("disparity"\) )Tj
T*(of Ediacaran organisms from three different fossil beds: Avalon in Canada, 575 Â )Tj
T*(to 565 million years ago; White Sea in Russia, 560 Â to 550 million years ago; )Tj
T*(and Nama in Namibia, 550 Â to 542 million years ago, immediately before the )Tj
T*(start of the Cambrian. They found that, while the White Sea assemblage had the )Tj
T*(most species, there was no significant difference in disparity between the )Tj
T*(three groups, and concluded that before the beginning of the Avalon timespan )Tj
T*(these organisms must have gone through their own evolutionary "explosion", )Tj
T*(which may have been similar to the famous Cambrian explosion .[96] )Tj
T*( [edit] Preservation bias )Tj
T*( The paucity of Ediacaran fossils after Cambrian could simply be because )Tj
T*(conditions no longer favoured the fossilisation of Ediacaran organisms, which )Tj
T*(may have continued to thrive unpreserved.[23] However, if they were common, )Tj
T*(more than the occasional specimen[5][97] might be expected in exceptionally )Tj
T*(preserved fossil assemblages \(Konservat-LagerstÃ¤tten\) such as the Burgess Shale )Tj
T*(and Chengjiang.[98] However, Vendobionta remain locally common in paleosols )Tj
T*(throughout the Cambrian[99] and into the Ordovician,[100] and may always have )Tj
T*(been rare in marine environments.[76] )Tj
T*( [edit] Predation and grazing )Tj
T*( It is suggested that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in the food chain )Tj
T*(caused the microbial mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared )Tj
T*(as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they )Tj
T*(destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of )Tj
T*(the biota; or that the destruction of the mat destabilised the ecosystem, )Tj
T*(causing extinctions. )Tj
T*( Alternatively, skeletonised animals could have fed directly on the relatively )Tj
T*(undefended Ediacaran biota.[37] However, if the interpretation of the Ediacaran )Tj
T*(age Kimberella as a grazer is correct then this suggests that the biota had )Tj
T*(already had limited exposure to "predation".[48] )Tj
T*( There is however little evidence for any trace fossils in the Ediacaran )Tj
T*(Period, which may speak against the active grazing theory. Further, the onset )Tj
T*(of the Cambrian Period is defined by the appearance of a worldwide trace fossil )Tj
T*(assemblage, quite distinct from the activity-barren Ediacaran Period. )Tj

T*( [edit] Assemblages )Tj
T*( Ediacaran-type fossils are recognised globally in 25 localities[21] and a )Tj
T*(variety of depositional conditions, and are commonly grouped into three main )Tj
T*(types, named after typical localities. Each assemblage tends to occupy its own )Tj
T*(region of morphospace, and after an initial burst of diversification changes )Tj
T*(little for the rest of its existence.[108] )Tj
T*( [edit] Avalon-type assemblage )Tj
T*( The Avalon-type assemblage is defined at Mistaken Point in Canada, the oldest )Tj
T*(locality with a large quantity of Ediacaran fossils.[109] The assemblage is )Tj
T*(easily dated because it contains many fine ash-beds, which are a good source of )Tj
T*(zircons used in the uranium-lead method of radiometric dating. These )Tj
T*(fine-grained ash beds also preserve exquisite detail. Constituents of this )Tj
T*(biota appear to survive through until the extinction of all Ediacarans at the )Tj
T*(base of the Cambrian.[108] )Tj
T*( The biota comprises deep sea dwelling rangeomorphs[110] such as Charnia, all )Tj
T*(of which share a fractal growth pattern. They were probably preserved in situ )Tj
T*(\(without post-mortem transportation\), although this point is not universally )Tj
T*(accepted. The assemblage, while less diverse than the Ediacara- or Nama-types, )Tj
T*(resembles Carboniferous suspension-feeding communities, which may suggest )Tj
T*(filter feeding[111]Â â€“ by most interpretations, the assemblage is found in water )Tj
T*(too deep for photosynthesis. The low diversity may reflect the depth of waterÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(which would restrict speciation opportunitiesÂ â€“ or it may just be too young for )Tj
T*(a rich biota to have evolved. Opinion is currently divided between these )Tj
T*(conflicting hypotheses.[112] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ediacara-type assemblage )Tj
T*( The Ediacara-type assemblage is named after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and )Tj
T*(consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are )Tj
T*(typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and )Tj
T*(flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate.[76] Most fossils are )Tj
T*(preserved as imprints in microbial earths,[113] but a few are preserved within )Tj
T*(sandy units.[112][108] )Tj
T*( [edit] Nama-type assemblage )Tj
T*( The Nama assemblage is best represented in Namibia. Three-dimensional )Tj
T*(preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing )Tj
T*(internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these organisms represent )Tj
T*(burrowing organisms,[41] while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface )Tj
T*(dwellers.[114] These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded )Tj
T*(sandstones, siltstones and shalesÂ â€“ with microbial mats, where present, usually )Tj
T*(containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed at )Tj
T*(the mouth of a delta's distributaries.[112] )Tj
T*( [edit] Significance of assemblages )Tj
T*( In the White Sea region of Russia, all three assemblage types have been found )Tj

T*( An extrasolar planet, or exoplanet, is a planet outside the Solar System. A )Tj
T*(total of 862 such planets \(in 678 planetary systems, including 129 multiple )Tj
T*(planetary systems\) have been identified as of February 12, 2013.[5] The Kepler )Tj
T*(mission has detected over 18,000 additional candidates, including potentially )Tj
T*(262 habitable ones.[6][7] In the Milky Way galaxy, it is expected that there )Tj
T*(are many billions of planets \(at least one planet, on average, orbiting around )Tj
T*(each star, resulting in 100-400 billion exoplanets\)[1][2][3][8], with many more )Tj
T*(free-floating planetary-mass bodies orbiting the galaxy directly.[9] The )Tj
T*(nearest known exoplanet is Alpha Centauri Bb. Almost all of the planets )Tj
T*(detected so far are within our home galaxy the Milky Way; however, there have )Tj
T*(been a small number of possible detections of extragalactic planets. )Tj
T*(Astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics \(CfA\) reported )Tj
T*(in January 2013, that "at least 17 billion" Earth-sized exoplanets are )Tj
T*(estimated to reside in the Milky Way Galaxy.[10] )Tj
T*( For centuries, many philosophers and scientists supposed that extrasolar )Tj
T*(planets existed, but there was no way of knowing how common they were or how )Tj
T*(similar they might be to the planets of the Solar System. Various detection )Tj
T*(claims, starting in the nineteenth century, were all eventually rejected by )Tj
T*(astronomers. The first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of )Tj
T*(several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12.[11] The )Tj
T*(first confirmed detection of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was )Tj
T*(made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the )Tj
T*(nearby star 51 Pegasi. Due to improved observational techniques, the rate of )Tj
T*(detections has increased rapidly since then.[5] Some exoplanets have been )Tj
T*(directly imaged by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through )Tj
T*(indirect methods such as radial velocity measurements.[5] Besides exoplanets, )Tj
T*("exocomets", comets beyond our solar system, have also been detected and may be )Tj
T*(common in the Milky Way Galaxy.[10] )Tj
T*( Most known exoplanets are giant planets believed to resemble Jupiter or )Tj
T*(Neptune, but this reflects a sampling bias, as massive planets are more easily )Tj
T*(observed.[12] Some relatively lightweight exoplanets, only a few times more )Tj
T*(massive than Earth \(now known by the term Super-Earth\), are known as well; )Tj
T*(statistical studies now indicate that they actually outnumber giant planets[13] )Tj
T*(while recent discoveries have included Earth-sized and smaller planets and a )Tj
T*(handful that appear to exhibit other Earth-like properties.[14][15][16] There )Tj
T*(also exist planetary-mass objects that orbit brown dwarfs and other bodies that )Tj
T*("float free" in space not bound to any star; however, the term "planet" is not )Tj
T*(always applied to these objects. )Tj
T*( The discovery of extrasolar planets, particularly those that orbit in the )Tj
T*(habitable zone where it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface )Tj
T*(\(and therefore also life\), has intensified interest in the search for )Tj
T*(extraterrestrial life.[17] Thus, the search for extrasolar planets also )Tj
T*(includes the study of planetary habitability, which considers a wide range of )Tj
T*(factors in determining an extrasolar planet's suitability for hosting life. )Tj
T*( On January 7, 2013, astronomers from the Kepler Mission space observatory )Tj

T*(Some of the earliest involve the binary star 70Â Ophiuchi. In 1855 Capt. W. S. )Tj
T*(Jacob at the East India Company's Madras Observatory reported that orbital )Tj
T*(anomalies made it "highly probable" that there was a "planetary body" in this )Tj
T*(system.[23] In the 1890s, Thomas J. J. See of the University of Chicago and the )Tj
T*(United States Naval Observatory stated that the orbital anomalies proved the )Tj
T*(existence of a dark body in the 70Â Ophiuchi system with a 36-year period around )Tj
T*(one of the stars.[24] However, Forest Ray Moulton published a paper proving )Tj
T*(that a three-body system with those orbital parameters would be highly )Tj
T*(unstable.[25] During the 1950s and 1960s, Peter van de Kamp of Swarthmore )Tj
T*(College made another prominent series of detection claims, this time for )Tj
T*(planets orbiting Barnard's Star.[26] Astronomers now generally regard all the )Tj
T*(early reports of detection as erroneous.[27] )Tj
T*( In 1991 Andrew Lyne, M. Bailes and S.L. Shemar claimed to have discovered a )Tj
T*(pulsar planet in orbit around PSR 1829-10, using pulsar timing variations.[28] )Tj
T*(The claim briefly received intense attention, but Lyne and his team soon )Tj
T*(retracted it.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Confirmed discoveries )Tj
T*( The first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in )Tj
T*(1988 by the Canadian astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and )Tj
T*(Stephenson Yang of University of Victoria and University of British )Tj
T*(Columbia.[30] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, )Tj
T*(their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star )Tj
T*(Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of )Tj
T*(instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for )Tj
T*(several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of )Tj
T*(the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate )Tj
T*(in mass between planets and stars. In 1990 additional observations were )Tj
T*(published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[31] )Tj
T*(but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[32] Finally, in 2003, )Tj
T*(improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[33] )Tj
T*( On 21 April 1992,[34] radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail )Tj
T*(announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.[11] )Tj
T*(This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first )Tj
T*(definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to have )Tj
T*(formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in )Tj
T*(a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of )Tj
T*(gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their )Tj

T*( On 6 October 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva )Tj
T*(announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting a )Tj
T*(main-sequence star, namely the nearby G-type star 51 Pegasi.[35] This )Tj
T*(discovery, made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ushered in the modern )Tj

T*( [edit] Detection methods )Tj
T*( Planets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. At visible )Tj
T*(wavelengths, they usually have less than a millionth of their parent star's )Tj
T*(brightness. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and )Tj
T*(furthermore the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is )Tj
T*(necessary to block the light from the parent star in order to reduce the glare, )Tj
T*(while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major )Tj
T*(technical challenge.[40] )Tj
T*( All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large \(more massive )Tj
T*(than Jupiter\) and widely separated from their parent star. Most of them are )Tj
T*(also very hot, so that they emit intense infrared radiation; the images have )Tj
T*(then been made at infrared where the planet is brighter than it is at visible )Tj
T*(wavelengths. )Tj
T*( Though direct imaging may become more important in the future, the vast )Tj
T*(majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect )Tj
T*(methods. The following are the indirect methods that have proven useful: )Tj
T*( As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around )Tj
T*(the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocityÂ â€” that )Tj
T*(is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from EarthÂ â€” can be detected )Tj
T*(from displacements in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. )Tj
T*(Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even )Tj
T*(somewhat less.[41] This has been by far the most productive method of )Tj
T*(discovering exoplanets. It has the advantage of being applicable to stars with )Tj
T*(a wide range of characteristics. One of its disadvantages is that it cannot )Tj
T*(determine a planet's true mass, but can only set a lower limit on that mass. )Tj
T*(However if the radial-velocity of the planet itself can be distinguished from )Tj
T*(the radial-velocity of the star then the true mass can be determined.[42])Tj
T*( If a planet crosses \(or transits\) in front of its parent star's disk, then the )Tj
T*(observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which )Tj
T*(the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other )Tj
T*(factors. This has been the second most productive method of detection, though )Tj
T*(it suffers from a substantial rate of false positives and confirmation from )Tj
T*(another method is usually considered necessary. The transit method reveals the )Tj
T*(radius of a planet, and it has the benefit that it sometimes allows a planet's )Tj
T*(atmosphere to be investigated through spectroscopy.)Tj

T*(indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit. )Tj
T*(For example, variations in the transits of the planet WASP-3b suggest the )Tj
T*(existence of a second planet in the system, the non-transiting WASP-3c.[43] If )Tj
T*(multiple transiting planets exist in one system, then this method can be used )Tj
T*(to confirm their existence.[44] In another form of the method, timing the )Tj
T*(eclipses in an eclipsing binary star can reveal an outer planet that orbits )Tj
T*(both stars; as of November 2011, five planets have been found in that way.)Tj
T*( Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, )Tj
T*(magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing )Tj
T*(star can cause detectable anomalies in the magnification as it varies over )Tj
T*(time. This method has resulted in only 13 detections as of June 2011, but it )Tj
T*(has the advantage of being especially sensitive to planets at large separations )Tj
T*(from their parent stars.)Tj
T*( Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and )Tj
T*(observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to )Tj
T*(the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion )Tj
T*(is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has )Tj
T*(produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used )Tj
T*(to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.)Tj
T*( A pulsar \(the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a )Tj
T*(supernova\) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets )Tj
T*(orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its )Tj
T*(observed radio pulses. The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet )Tj
T*(was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; )Tj
T*(five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.)Tj
T*( Disks of space dust surround many stars, believed to originate from collisions )Tj
T*(among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs )Tj
T*(starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Features in the disks may )Tj
T*(suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive )Tj
T*(detection method.)Tj
T*(  Most confirmed extrasolar planets have been found using ground-based )Tj
T*(telescopes. However, many of the methods can work more effectively with )Tj
T*(space-based telescopes that avoid atmospheric haze and turbulence. COROT )Tj
T*(\(launched December 2006\) and Kepler \(launched March 2009\) are the two currently )Tj
T*(active space missions dedicated to searching for extrasolar planets. Hubble )Tj
T*(Space Telescope and MOST have also found or confirmed a few planets. The Gaia )Tj

T*(body.[48] Some of these may have once belonged to a star's planetary system )Tj
T*(before being ejected from it; the term "rogue planet" is sometimes applied to )Tj
T*(such objects.\) )Tj
T*( However, the IAU's working definition is not universally accepted. One )Tj
T*(alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from brown dwarfs )Tj
T*(on the basis of formation. It is widely believed that giant planets form )Tj
T*(through core accretion, and that process may sometimes produce planets with )Tj
T*(masses above the deuterium fusion threshold;[49][50] massive planets of that )Tj
T*(sort may have already been observed.[51] This viewpoint also admits the )Tj
T*(possibility of sub-brown dwarfs, which have planetary masses but form like )Tj
T*(stars from the direct collapse of clouds of gas. )Tj
T*( Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. )Tj
T*(Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff. The )Tj
T*(amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the )Tj
T*(object.[52] The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25 )Tj

T*( [edit] Nomenclature )Tj
T*( [edit] Multiple-star standard )Tj
T*( The standard for naming exoplanets is an extension of the one used by the )Tj
T*(Washington Multiplicity Catalog \(WMC\) for multiple-star systems.[55] This )Tj
T*(section will therefore start by briefly discussing the WMC standard, which has )Tj
T*(been adopted by the International Astronomical Union.[55] )Tj
T*( Under that standard, the brightest member of a system receives the letter "A." )Tj
T*(Distinct components not contained within "A" are labeled "B", "C", etc. )Tj
T*(Sub-components are designated by one or more suffixes with the primary label, )Tj
T*(starting with lowercase letters for the 2nd hierarchical level and then numbers )Tj
T*(for the 3rd.[56] For example, if there is a triple star system in which two )Tj
T*(stars orbit each other closely while a third star is in a more distant orbit, )Tj
T*(the two closely orbiting stars would be considered a component with two )Tj
T*(subcomponents. They would receive the designations Aa and Ab, while the third )Tj
T*(star would receive the designation B. \(Note that, for historical reasons, this )Tj
T*(standard is not always strictly followed. For example, the three members of the )Tj
T*(Alpha Centauri triple star system are conventionally referred to as Alpha )Tj
T*(Centauri A, B and C while the formal standard would give their designations as )Tj
T*(Alpha Centauri Aa, Ab and B respectively.\) )Tj
T*( [edit] Extrasolar planet standard )Tj
T*( Following an extension of the above standard, an exoplanet's name is normally )Tj
T*(formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The )Tj
T*(first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" and later )Tj
T*(planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are )Tj
T*(discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, )Tj
T*(followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. )Tj
T*( For instance, in the 55 Cancri system the first planetÂ â€“ 55 Cancri bÂ â€“ was )Tj
T*(discovered in 1996; two additional farther planets were simultaneously )Tj
T*(discovered in 2002 with the nearest to the star being named 55 Cancri c and the )Tj
T*(other 55 Cancri d; a fourth planet was claimed \(its existence was later )Tj
T*(disputed\) in 2004 and named 55 Cancri e despite lying closer to the star than )Tj
T*(55 Cancri b; and the most recently discovered planet, in 2007, was named 55 )Tj
T*(Cancri f despite lying between 55 Cancri c and 55 Cancri d.[57] As of April )Tj
T*(2012 the highest letter in use is "j", for the unconfirmed planet HD 10180 j )Tj
T*(\(HD 10180 h is the confirmed planet with the highest letter\).[5] )Tj
T*( If a planet orbits one member of a binary star system, then an uppercase )Tj

T*( If the parent star is a single star, then it may still be regarded as having )Tj

T*( A few exoplanets have been given names that do not conform to the above )Tj

T*( [edit] Circumbinary planets and 2010 proposal )Tj
T*( Hessman et al. state that the implicit system for exoplanet names utterly )Tj
T*(failed with the discovery of circumbinary planets.[55] They note that the )Tj
T*(discoverers of the two planets around HW Virginis tried to circumvent the )Tj

T*(the 4th objectÂ â€“ stellar or planetaryÂ â€“ discovered in the system. They also )Tj
T*(note that the discoverers of the two planets around NN Serpentis were )Tj
T*(confronted with multiple suggestions from various official sources and finally )Tj
T*(chose to use the designations "NN Ser c" and "NN Ser d." )Tj
T*( The proposal of Hessman et al. starts with the following two rules: )Tj
T*( Rule 1. The formal name of an exoplanet is obtained by appending the )Tj
T*(appropriate suffixes to the formal name of the host star or stellar system. The )Tj
T*(upper hierarchy is defined by upper-case letters, followed by lower-case )Tj
T*(letters, followed by numbers, etc. The naming order within a hierarchical level )Tj
T*(is for the order of discovery only. \(This rule corresponds to the present )Tj
T*(provisional WMC naming convention.\))Tj
T*(Rule 2. Whenever the leading capital letter designation is missing, this is )Tj
T*(interpreted as being an informal form with an implicit "A" unless otherwise )Tj
T*(explicitly stated. \(This rule corresponds to the present exoplanet community )Tj
T*(usage for planets around single stars.\))Tj
T*(  They note that under these two proposed rules all of the present names for )Tj
T*(99% of the planets around single stars are preserved as informal forms of the )Tj
T*(IAU sanctioned provisional standard. They would rename Tau BoÃ¶tis b formally as )Tj
T*(Tau BoÃ¶tis Ab, retaining the prior form as an informal usage \(using Rule 2, )Tj
T*(above\). )Tj
T*( To deal with the difficulties relating to circumbinary planets, the proposal )Tj
T*(contains two further rules: )Tj
T*( Rule 3. As an alternative to the nomenclature standard in Rule 1, a )Tj
T*(hierarchical relationship can be expressed by concatenating the names of the )Tj
T*(higher order system and placing them in parentheses, after which the suffix for )Tj
T*(a lower order system is added.)Tj
T*(Rule 4. When in doubt \(i.e. if a different name has not been clearly set in the )Tj

T*(dynamically distinct \(sub-\)systems in order of their dynamical relevance. The )Tj
T*(choice of hierarchical levels should be made to emphasize dynamical )Tj
T*(relationships, if known.)Tj
T*(  They submit that the new form using parentheses is the best for known )Tj
T*(circumbinary planets and has the desirable effect of giving these planets )Tj

T*(massive star eventually evolves into a cooler red giant which rotates more )Tj
T*(slowly and thus can be measured using the radial velocity method. As of early )Tj
T*(2011 about 30 Jupiter class planets had been found around K-giant stars )Tj
T*(including Pollux, Gamma Cephei and Iota Draconis. Doppler surveys around a wide )Tj
T*(variety of stars indicate about 1 in 6 stars having twice the mass of the Sun )Tj
T*(are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, vs. 1 in 16 for Sun-like )Tj
T*(stars and only 1 in 50 for class M red dwarfs. On the other hand, microlensing )Tj
T*(surveys indicate that long-period Neptune-mass planets are found around 1 in 3 )Tj
T*(M dwarfs. [70] Observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate that )Tj
T*(extremely massive stars of spectral category O, which are much hotter than our )Tj
T*(Sun, produce a photo-evaporation effect that inhibits planetary formation.[71] )Tj
T*( [edit] Metallicity )Tj
T*( Ordinary stars are composed mainly of the light elements hydrogen and helium. )Tj
T*(They also contain a small proportion of heavier elements, and this fraction is )Tj
T*(referred to as a star's metallicity \(even if the elements are not metals in the )Tj
T*(traditional sense, such as iron\). Giant planets are more likely to be found the )Tj
T*(higher the star's metallicity;[65] however, smaller planets are present around )Tj
T*(stars with a wide range of metallicities.[72] It has also been shown that stars )Tj
T*(with planets are more likely to be deficient in lithium.[73] )Tj
T*( [edit] Orbital parameters )Tj
T*( Many planetary systems are not as placid as the Solar System, and have extreme )Tj
T*(orbital parameters and strongly interacting orbits, so that Kepler's laws do )Tj
T*(not hold in such systems.[74] )Tj
T*( Most known extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered using indirect )Tj
T*(methods and therefore only some of their physical and orbital parameters can be )Tj
T*(determined. For example, out of the six independent parameters that define an )Tj
T*(orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: semi-major axis, )Tj
T*(eccentricity, longitude of periastron, and time of periastron. Two parameters )Tj
T*(remain unknown: inclination and longitude of the ascending node. )Tj
T*( [edit] Semi-major axis )Tj
T*( Many exoplanets have orbits with very small semi-major axes, and are thus much )Tj
T*(closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun. )Tj
T*(This is mainly due to observational selection: the radial-velocity method is )Tj
T*(most sensitive to planets with small orbits. Astronomers were initially very )Tj
T*(surprised by these "hot Jupiters", but it is now clear that most exoplanets )Tj
T*(have much larger orbits, some located in habitable zones with temperature )Tj
T*(potentially suitable for liquid water and life.[66] It appears plausible that )Tj
T*(in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits )Tj
T*(comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant )Tj
T*(planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least )Tj
T*(around Sun-like stars.[75] )Tj
T*( [edit] Eccentricity )Tj
T*( The eccentricity of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical \(elongated\) it is. )Tj
T*(Most exoplanets with orbital periods of 20 days or less have near-circular )Tj
T*(orbits, i.e. very low eccentricity. That is believed to be due to tidal )Tj
T*(circularization: reduction of eccentricity over time due to gravitational )Tj
T*(interaction between two bodies. By contrast, most known exoplanets with longer )Tj
T*(orbital periods have quite eccentric orbits. \(As of July 2010, 55% of such )Tj
T*(exoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.2 while 17% have eccentricities )Tj
T*(greater than 0.5.[5]\) This is not an observational selection effect, since a )Tj
T*(planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its )Tj
T*(orbit. The prevalence of elliptical orbits is a major puzzle, since current )Tj
T*(theories of planetary formation strongly suggest planets should form with )Tj
T*(circular \(that is, non-eccentric\) orbits.[27] The prevalence of eccentric )Tj
T*(orbits may also indicate that the Solar System is unusual, since all of its )Tj
T*(planets except for Mercury have near-circular orbits.[65] )Tj
T*( However, it is suggested that some of the high eccentricity values reported )Tj
T*(for exoplanets may be overestimates, since simulations show that many )Tj
T*(observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported )Tj
T*(observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% )Tj

T*(chance of being a pair of planets.[76] This misinterpretation is especially )Tj
T*(likely if the two planets orbit with a 2:1 resonance. One group of astronomers )Tj
T*(has concluded that "\(1\) around 35% of the published eccentric one-planet )Tj
T*(solutions are statistically indistinguishable from planetary systems in 2:1 )Tj
T*(orbital resonance, \(2\) another 40% cannot be statistically distinguished from a )Tj
T*(circular orbital solution" and "\(3\) planets with masses comparable to Earth )Tj
T*(could be hidden in known orbital solutions of eccentric super-Earths and )Tj
T*(Neptune mass planets."[77] )Tj
T*( [edit] Inclination )Tj
T*( A combination of astrometric and radial velocity measurements has shown that )Tj
T*(some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly )Tj
T*(tilted relative to each other, unlike the Solar System.[78] Research has now )Tj
T*(also shown that more than half of hot Jupiters have orbital planes )Tj
T*(substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial )Tj
T*(fraction even have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit in the opposite )Tj
T*(direction from the star's rotation.[79] Andrew Cameron of the University of St )Tj
T*(Andrews stated, "The new results really challenge the conventional wisdom that )Tj
T*(planets should always orbit in the same direction as their star's spin."[80] )Tj
T*(Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star )Tj
T*(itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between )Tj
T*(the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disc.[81] )Tj
T*( [edit] Resonance )Tj
T*( Extrasolar planets with notable orbital parameters include KOI-730, which )Tj
T*(contains four planets in a 8:6:4:3 orbital resonance.[82] This was originally )Tj
T*(thought to be 6:4:4:3, where one of the center planets was trapped in the )Tj
T*(other's L4 or L5 Lagrange point.[83] Such co-orbital planets are thought to be )Tj
T*(the origin of the impact that produced the Earthâ€“Moon system because models )Tj
T*(suggest the collision was low-speed.[84] )Tj
T*( [edit] Circumbinary orbit )Tj
T*( Kepler-16 contains a planet orbiting around two suns, which orbit around each )Tj
T*(other. The planet is comparable to Saturn in mass and size and is on a nearly )Tj
T*(circular 229-day orbit around its two stars. The stars have an eccentric 41-day )Tj
T*(orbit.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Mass distribution )Tj
T*( When a planet is found by the radial-velocity method, its orbital inclination )Tj
T*(i is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to )Tj
T*(determine the true mass \(M\) of the planet, but rather gives a lower limit for )Tj
T*(its mass MÂ sini. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more massive )Tj
T*(object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However the probability of a small )Tj
T*(value of i \(say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least )Tj
T*(double the observed lower limit\) is relatively low \(1-\(âˆš3\)/2 â‰ˆ 13%\) and hence )Tj
T*(most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower )Tj
T*(limit.[66] Furthermore, if the planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the )Tj
T*(line of vision \(i.e. i close to 90Â°\), the planet can also be detected through )Tj
T*(the transit method. The inclination will then be known, and the planet's true )Tj
T*(mass can be found. Also, astrometric observations and dynamical considerations )Tj
T*(in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's )Tj
T*(true mass. )Tj
T*( As of September 2011, all but 50 of the many known exoplanets have more than )Tj
T*(ten times the mass of Earth.[5] Many are considerably more massive than )Tj
T*(Jupiter, the most massive planet in the Solar System. However, these high )Tj
T*(masses are in large part due to an observational selection effect: all )Tj
T*(detection methods are more likely to discover massive planets. This bias makes )Tj
T*(statistical analysis difficult, but it appears that lower-mass planets are )Tj
T*(actually more common than higher-mass ones, at least within a broad mass range )Tj
T*(that includes all giant planets. In addition, the discovery of several planets )Tj
T*(only a few times more massive than Earth, despite the great difficulty of )Tj
T*(detecting them, indicates that such planets are fairly common.[65] )Tj
T*( The results from the first 43 days of the Kepler mission "imply that small )Tj

T*( [edit] Density and bulk composition )Tj
T*( If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, )Tj
T*(then both its true mass and its radius can be found. The planet's density can )Tj
T*(then be calculated. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly )Tj
T*(of hydrogen and helium, while planets of intermediate density are inferred to )Tj
T*(have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is believed to be )Tj
T*(rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System. )Tj
T*( Many transiting exoplanets are much larger than expected given their mass, )Tj
T*(meaning that they have surprisingly low density. Several theories have been )Tj
T*(proposed to explain this observation, but none have yet been widely accepted )Tj
T*(among astronomers.[85] )Tj
T*( [edit] Atmosphere )Tj
T*( Spectroscopic measurements can be used to study a transiting planet's )Tj
T*(atmospheric composition.[86] Water vapor, sodium vapor, methane, and carbon )Tj
T*(dioxide have been detected in the atmospheres of various exoplanets in this )Tj
T*(way.[87][88] The technique might conceivably discover atmospheric )Tj
T*(characteristics that suggest the presence of life on an exoplanet, but no such )Tj
T*(discovery has yet been made. )Tj
T*( Another line of information about exoplanetary atmospheres comes from )Tj
T*(observations of orbital phase functions. Extrasolar planets have phases similar )Tj
T*(to the phases of the Moon. By observing the exact variation of brightness with )Tj
T*(phase, astronomers can calculate particle sizes in the atmospheres of planets. )Tj
T*( Stellar light is polarized by atmospheric molecules; this could be detected )Tj
T*(with a polarimeter. So far, one planet has been studied by polarimetry. )Tj
T*( [edit] Temperature )Tj
T*( One can estimate the temperature of an exoplanet based on the intensity of the )Tj
T*(light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet )Tj
T*(OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly âˆ’220 )Tj
T*(Â°C \(50 K\). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they )Tj
T*(depend on the planet's usually unknown albedo, and because factors such as the )Tj
T*(greenhouse effect may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had )Tj
T*(their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as )Tj
T*(the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For )Tj
T*(example, the planet HD 189733b has been found to have an average temperature of )Tj
T*(1205Â±9 K \(932Â±9 Â°C\) on its dayside and 973Â±33 K \(700Â±33 Â°C\) on its )Tj
T*(nightside.[89] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other properties )Tj
T*( On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of )Tj
T*(water, however in 2007 two independent teams of researchers came to opposing )Tj
T*(conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger )Tj
T*(super-earths[90][91] with one team saying that plate tectonics would be )Tj
T*(episodic or stagnant[92] and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very )Tj
T*(likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.[93] )Tj
T*( Other questions are how likely exoplanets are to possess moons and )Tj
T*(magnetospheres. No such moons and magnetospheres have yet been detected, but )Tj
T*(they may be fairly common. )Tj
T*( [edit] Habitability )Tj
T*( Several planets have orbits in their parent star's habitable zone, where it )Tj
T*(should be possible for liquid water to exist and for Earth-like conditions to )Tj
T*(prevail. Most of those planets are giant planets more similar to Jupiter than )Tj
T*(to Earth; if any of them have large moons, the moons might be a more plausible )Tj

T*(Hurricane Center. Previously, subtropical storms were not given names.[1] The )Tj
T*(cyclone was also the latest-forming first hurricane of the season since 1941. )Tj
T*( [edit] Meteorological history )Tj
T*( An area of disturbed weather in association with a weak surface trough and a )Tj
T*(stronger upper-level trough between the Bahamas and Bermuda developed on )Tj
T*(September 6.[2]High pressure ridging strengthened by Tropical Storm Fay caused )Tj
T*(the trough to become more organized and close off into a broad non-tropical low )Tj
T*(on September 7.[2] By September 8, the system had developed enough convection )Tj
T*(near its center of circulation to be classified Subtropical Depression Eight )Tj
T*(while located southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[2] Later that day, )Tj
T*(data from a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the system )Tj
T*(had strengthened into a subtropical storm, and the depression was upgraded to )Tj
T*(Subtropical Storm Gustav.[3] )Tj
T*( Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest toward the North Carolina-South )Tj
T*(Carolina border over the next two days, it slowly strengthened, acquiring more )Tj
T*(tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger )Tj
T*(winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical )Tj
T*(storm[4] shortly before turning toward the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, )Tj
T*(then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast.[2] On September )Tj
T*(11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav )Tj
T*(quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the )Tj
T*(intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000.[2] Gustav reached its peak )Tj
T*(intensity of 100Â mph \(160Â km/h\) later that day.[2] )Tj
T*( The hurricane began to slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics on )Tj
T*(early September 12 as it moved over colder waters and encountered increasing )Tj
T*(wind shear. However, the storm was moving quickly enough to make landfall over )Tj
T*(Cape Breton, Nova Scotia as a CategoryÂ 1 hurricane on September 12.[5] Later )Tj
T*(that morning, Gustav made a second landfall in Newfoundland and became )Tj
T*(extratropical shortly after.[6] The extratropical low continued moving slowly )Tj
T*(to the northeast before dissipating over the Labrador Sea on September 15.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Preparations )Tj
T*( On September 8, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted that )Tj
T*(Gustav would approach the North Carolina coast, and issued a tropical storm )Tj
T*(watch from Cape Fear to the North Carolina â€“ Virginia border. The tropical )Tj
T*(storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 9, and a new )Tj
T*(tropical storm watch was issued later that day for areas of southeastern )Tj
T*(Virginia, from the North Carolina â€“ Virginia border to New Point Comfort. The )Tj
T*(new watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on September 10. As Gustav )Tj
T*(began to turn to the northeast and away from the Mid-Atlantic coast, the )Tj
T*(tropical storm warnings were gradually discontinued. The last warning was )Tj
T*(discontinued on September 11.[2] )Tj
T*( As Gustav approached Atlantic Canada, Environment Canada and the Canadian )Tj
T*(Hurricane Centre issued heavy rain and wind warnings for southern New )Tj
T*(Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Impact )Tj
T*( [edit] North Carolina and Virginia )Tj
T*( Although the center of Gustav passed just to the east of Cape Hatteras, areas )Tj
T*(of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia experienced heavy rain and tropical )Tj
T*(storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2â€“5Â inches \(50â€“125Â mm\) of )Tj
T*(rain and winds of up to 50Â mph \(80Â km/h\), and the Coast Guard station at Cape )Tj
T*(Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78Â mph \(125Â km/h\). The storm produced storm )Tj
T*(surges of 3â€“6 feet \(1.8Â m\) along the Outer Banks, and 1â€“3 feet \(0.91Â m\) along )Tj
T*(the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds )Tj
T*(and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and )Tj
T*(Hatteras Village, North Carolina.[8] A weak waterspout also touched down on )Tj
T*(Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was )Tj
T*(reported.[9] Sporadic power outages were also reported.[10] One person died )Tj
T*(after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be )Tj
T*(rescued from riptides and storm surges.[2] Damage in the region amounted to )Tj

T*( [edit] New Jersey )Tj
T*( Although the center of Gustav remained well offshore, the difference in )Tj
T*(pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States )Tj
T*(caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged )Tj
T*(from 35â€“45Â mph \(55â€“70Â km/h\), with stronger winds reported near the coast.[11] A )Tj
T*(maximum wind gust of 60Â mph \(100Â km/h\) was reported at Keansburg.[11] The )Tj
T*(strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout the eastern half of the )Tj
T*(state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the )Tj
T*(vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power.[11] In West )Tj
T*(Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he )Tj
T*(was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West )Tj
T*(Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and )Tj
T*(injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on )Tj
T*(vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] New York and New England )Tj
T*( The interaction between Gustav and the non-tropical system caused strong winds )Tj
T*(that affected areas of coastal New England, mainly in eastern New York and )Tj
T*(Massachusetts. Some areas reported storm-force wind gusts of over 55Â mph \(90Â )Tj
T*(km/h\), and a maximum wind gust of 67Â mph \(108Â km/h\) was reported by a weather )Tj
T*(spotter in Catskill, New York.[12] Wind gusts of up to 50Â mph \(80Â km/h\) were )Tj
T*(reported in areas of Massachusetts.[13] The winds downed trees and power lines, )Tj
T*(and several homes and cars were damaged by fallen trees. Over 29,000 homes were )Tj
T*(left without power in eastern New York,[12] and 19,000 homes lost power in )Tj
T*(Massachusetts.[13] In all, the winds caused $240,000 \(2002Â USD\) in damage,[13] )Tj
T*(but this damage was not directly attributed to Gustav in the National Hurricane )Tj
T*(Center's analysis.[2] )Tj
T*( In the New York City area, a peak wind gust of 60Â mph \(100Â km/h\) was reported )Tj
T*(at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The winds caused some minor roof )Tj
T*(damage to buildings, and forced officials in New York City to cordon off parts )Tj
T*(of Manhattan as debris ranging from wrapping paper to crushed soda cans was )Tj
T*(blown about. This debris injured four people, one critically,[14] and disrupted )Tj
T*(a 9/11 memorial service, though it continued as planned.[15] )Tj
T*( Sustained winds of 25â€“35Â mph \(40â€“55Â km/h\), with gusts up to 55Â mph \(90Â km/h\), )Tj
T*(were reported throughout Long Island.[14] Damage on the island was mainly )Tj
T*(limited to downed trees and power lines, although the Long Island Power )Tj
T*(Authority reported that at least 93,000 homes lost power during the day on )Tj
T*(September 11. One person was killed when his boat capsized in the Long Island )Tj
T*(Sound.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Atlantic Canada )Tj
T*( Despite gradually losing its tropical characteristics, Gustav brought heavy )Tj
T*(rain, storm and hurricane force winds, and storm surges to areas of Atlantic )Tj
T*(Canada for several days. Strong winds knocked down trees and damaged docks in )Tj
T*(Nova Scotia,[2] and a wind gust of 75Â mph \(122Â km/h\) was reported on Sable )Tj
T*(Island. Gusts to over 60Â mph \(100Â km/h\) were reported in Newfoundland for )Tj
T*(several days after the center of Gustav moved out of the area. Rainfall amounts )Tj
T*(generally ranged from 0.3â€“2.7Â inches \(10â€“70Â mm\), with a maximum of 4Â inches )Tj
T*(\(102Â mm\) in Ashdale, Nova Scotia. Several locations set new daily rainfall )Tj
T*(records.[5] Localized flooding was reported in areas of Prince Edward Island, )Tj
T*(and 4,000Â people in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Charlottetown, Prince Edward )Tj
T*(Island were left without power. Despite the heavy rain and wind, there were no )Tj
T*(reports of deaths or significant damage in Atlantic Canada.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Naming and records )Tj
T*( Gustav was the first subtropical storm to be given a name from the current )Tj
T*(name lists by the National Hurricane Center. Prior to the 2002 season, Atlantic )Tj
T*(subtropical storms were either not named or given a number from a separate )Tj
T*(numbering list than tropical cyclones.[1] )Tj
T*( When Gustav attained hurricane status on September 11, it became the latest )Tj
T*(first hurricane to form in any season since the 1941 season, when the first )Tj

T*( [edit] Background and recording )Tj
T*( On New Year's Day 1987, Bill Drummond decided to make a hip hop record under )Tj
T*(the pseudonym "The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu".[1] Despite his small knowledge )Tj
T*(about modern music technology, he invited Jimmy Cauty, a former member of the )Tj
T*(band Brilliant, to join him. Cauty reportedly agreed, and The JAMs' debut )Tj
T*(single "All You Need Is Love" was independently released on 9 March 1987 as a )Tj
T*(limited edition one-sided white label 12-inch.[2] Cauty conceived the pseudonym )Tj
T*("Rockman Rock", while Drummond used the nickname "King Boy D".[3] )Tj
T*( The reaction to "All You Need Is Love" was positive, with the record being )Tj
T*(made single of the week in the British music weekly Sounds Magazine,[4] and The )Tj
T*(JAMs lauded as "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year".[5] However, )Tj
T*("All You Need Is Love"'s unusual reliance on uncleared, often illegal samples )Tj
T*(made commercial release impossible.[6] In response, The JAMs re-edited the )Tj
T*(single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples, and re-released it )Tj
T*(as "All You Need Is Love \(106Â bpm\)" in May 1987.[7] According to Drummond, )Tj
T*(profits from this re-release funded the recording of their first album.[8] The )Tj
T*(JAMs had completed and pressed copies of the album by early May 1987, but )Tj
T*(didn't have a distributor.[9] )Tj
T*( Like "All You Need Is Love", the album was made using an Apple II computer, a )Tj
T*(Greengate DS3 digital sampler peripheral card, and a Roland TR-808 drum )Tj
T*(machine.[10] Using portions from existing works and pasting them into new )Tj
T*(contexts, with the duo stealing "everything" and "taking... plagiarism to its )Tj
T*(absurd conclusion," several songs were liberally plagiarised.[11] This mashup )Tj
T*(of samples was underpinned by rudimentary beatbox rhythms and overlaid with )Tj
T*(Drummond's raps of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. Drummond )Tj
T*(would later say in an interview that: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(We'd just got ourselves a sampler, and we went sample-crazy. We just ... went )Tj
T*(through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it )Tj
T*(all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing )Tj
T*(it.... When we put that record out, we knew what we were doing was illegal, but )Tj
T*(we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear )Tj
T*(about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a )Tj
T*(big review.[12])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Composition )Tj
T*( 1987 is built around samples of other artists' work, "to the point where the )Tj
T*(presence of original material becomes questionable".[13] The album is raw and )Tj
T*(unpolished, the sound contrasting sharply with the meticulous production and )Tj
T*(tight house rhythms of the duo's later work as The KLF.[14][15] The beatbox )Tj
T*(rhythms are basic \("weedy", according to Q Magazine\),[16] samples often cut )Tj
T*(abruptly, and distinctive plagiarised melodies are often played with a )Tj
T*(high-pitched rasping accompaniment. The plagiarised works are arranged so as to )Tj
T*(juxtapose with each other as a backdrop for The JAMs' rebellious messages and )Tj
T*(social comments.[17] Lyrics include self-referential statements of The JAMs' )Tj
T*(agenda that clash with the fictional backstory adopted from The Illuminatus! )Tj
T*(Trilogy.[11][18] Several songs \(such as "The Queen and I" and "All You Need Is )Tj
T*(Love"\) have specific societal targets for Drummond's satirical raps. )Tj
T*( [edit] Side one )Tj
T*( The album's opening song, "Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees", begins with )Tj
T*(simulated human sexual intercourse noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's )Tj
T*(first plagiarism is a sample "Here we come..." from The Monkees' theme. It )Tj
T*(progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: "Here we come, )Tj
T*(crawling out of the mud, from chaos primeval to the barnyard sun, dragging our )Tj
T*(bad selves from one end of time, with nothing to declare but some half-written )Tj
T*(rhymes". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's )Tj
T*(voice follow - "We're not The Monkees, I don't even like The Monkees!"[11] - )Tj

T*(ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any )Tj

T*( The track is followed by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving )Tj
T*(at and leaving a tube station, with its mechanised warning to passengers, "Mind )Tj
T*(the gap...". "Don't Take Five \(Take What You Want\)" follows, featuring The )Tj
T*(JAMs' associates Chike \(rapper\) and DJ Cesare \(scratches\). Built around The )Tj
T*(Dave Brubeck Quartet's "Take Five" and Fred Wesley's "Same Beat",[10] the )Tj
T*(lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing )Tj
T*(references to food: "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I )Tj
T*(first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes )Tj
T*(when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the )Tj

T*(piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting )Tj
T*(himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of )Tj
T*(recording history".[20] )Tj
T*( The first side of the LP closes with "Rockman Rock \(Parts 2 and 3\)", a homage )Tj
T*(to Jimmy Cauty that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the "Bo )Tj
T*(Diddley Beat" and "Sunrise Sunset" from the Fiddler on the Roof soundtrack. Led )Tj

T*( The second side begins with "Máº¹ Ru Con", an emotive Vietnamese song originally )Tj
T*(titled "Ca Dao Máº¹", written by Trinh Cong Son performed a cappella by The JAMs' )Tj
T*(friend Duy Khiem. According to Drummond, it was a spontaneous recital by Khiem, )Tj
T*(who was in the studio contributing clarinet and tenor sax to the album.[10] )Tj
T*(Khiem's vocal performance was later sampled by The KLF on the ambient house )Tj
T*(soundtrack to their movie, The Rites of Mu. )Tj
T*( "The Queen and I" features excessive amounts of samples from ABBA's "Dancing )Tj
T*(Queen", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into )Tj
T*(Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional account of his march )Tj
T*(into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The )Tj
T*(song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport \("When )Tj
T*(cancer is the killer/John Player run the league"\) and lambasts the "tabloid )Tj
T*(mentality" \("They all keep talking about Princess Di's dress"\).[20] The Sex )Tj
T*(Pistols' "God Save the Queen" is briefly sampled.[11] After nearly three )Tj
T*(minutes of samples from the television show Top of the Pops, as well as other )Tj
T*(BBC programming, Drummond cries "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic )Tj
T*("All You Need Is Love \(106 bpm\)" follows. A "stunning audio collage" featuring )Tj
T*(an AIDS public information film, a rerecording of glamour model Samantha Fox's )Tj
T*("Touch Me \(I Want Your Body\)",[21] and the nursery rhyme "Ring a Ring O'Roses", )Tj
T*("All You Need Is Love" comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the )Tj
T*(AIDS crisis.[4] )Tj
T*( The final track on the album is "Next", which Drummond describes as "the only )Tj
T*(angst-er on the album", with "imagery of war and sordid sex".[10] The track )Tj
T*(samples Stevie Wonder's "Superstition", Scott Walker's "Next" from Scott 2, the )Tj

T*( In 1991, Drummond admitted: "We didn't listen to 1987 What The Fuck's Going On )Tj
T*(for a long time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it because it was so )Tj
T*(badly recorded. But I still felt we were able to get a lot out of ourselves )Tj
T*(through it."[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Release, reception and controversy )Tj
T*( 1987 \(What the Fuck Is Going On?\) was released in June 1987 on The JAMs' own )Tj
T*(record label, "The Sound of Mu\(sic\)".[23] )Tj
T*( 1987 was met with mixed reviews in most of the major British music )Tj
T*(publications, including Melody Maker, NME, Sounds, and Q, and the album came to )Tj
T*(the attention of the management of Swedish pop group ABBA:[24] The JAMs had )Tj
T*(sampled large portions of the ABBA single "Dancing Queen" on the track "The )Tj
T*(Queen And I". A legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright )Tj
T*(Protection Society \(MCPS\) followed, 1987 was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and )Tj
T*(The JAMs were ordered to "deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any )Tj
T*(other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record".[21][25] )Tj
T*( King Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of Sweden, in the )Tj
T*(hope of meeting with ABBA personally,[21] taking an NME journalist and )Tj
T*(photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a )Tj
T*(gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in )Tj
T*(Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they )Tj
T*(pretended was Agnetha "fallen on hard times." Of the original LP's stock, some )Tj
T*(copies were disposed overboard on the North Sea ferry trip across, and the )Tj
T*(remainder were burned in a field in Gothenburg before dawn \(as shown on the )Tj
T*(cover of their next album, Who Killed The JAMs?\). The JAMs also played a )Tj
T*(recording of "The Queen and I" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record )Tj
T*(label, Polar Music. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally )Tj
T*(hitting and killing a moose, and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet )Tj
T*(cracking the engine of their Ford Galaxie police car.[26] They were, by their )Tj
T*(own account, towed back to England by the AA.[27] )Tj
T*( The JAMs were not entirely sure what they would have said to ABBA if they had )Tj
T*(been able to meet them. Rockman told NME: "We were hoping to explain [our )Tj
T*(artistic justification] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you )Tj
T*(know, them producing our album and us producing theirs - the kind of thing that )Tj
T*(often happens at these meetings." King Boy: "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you )Tj
T*(haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West )Tj
T*(End musical shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [sic] album.'"[27] In 1994, )Tj
T*(The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as "a grand, futile, )Tj
T*(attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [the )Tj
T*(duo's] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" Drummond )Tj
T*(later acknowledged."[28] )Tj
T*( The JAMs offered what they claimed were "the last five" copies of 1987 for )Tj
T*(sale at Â£1000 each in a full-page advertisement in the April 1988 edition of )Tj
T*(The Face.[29] Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' )Tj
T*(agreement with the MCPS: "We were browsing around this record shop and came )Tj
T*(across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS )Tj
T*(that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... [B]ecause we )Tj
T*(bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can do )Tj
T*(what we like with them and not break any laws."[30] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical response )Tj
T*( Q magazine had mixed reactions to 1987, saying that there are "too few ideas )Tj
T*(being spread too thin". The magazine criticized some songs as "overlong" and )Tj
T*(questioned the overuse of sampling as "the impression of a random hotchpotch". )Tj
T*(Q also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' "use of the beatbox is altogether )Tj
T*(weedy". However it liked some of its tracks: "there are some wickedly amusing )Tj
T*(ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical )Tj
T*(juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated )Tj
T*(listenings".[16] )Tj

T*(obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they )Tj
T*(make anything else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately )Tj
T*(humourless."[11] "It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics as little more than a )Tj
T*(brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town", a later article )Tj
T*(said, but "believe me, it's far more than a gimmick".[32] )Tj
T*( In awarding 1987 the highest rating, a maximum five stars, Soundsâ€”a )Tj
T*(publication that offered the duo's work consistent approvalâ€”mused, "Taking the )Tj
T*(sound of the moment \(hip hop\) as a backbone, 1987 steals sound artefacts from )Tj
T*(anywhere ... and meshes them together with King Boy's hysterical 'Clydeside' )Tj
T*(rap method with bewildering effect. ... [Y]ou could call this sampling )Tj
T*(technology's answer to T. S. Eliot's arch cut up work, The Wasteland. "[20] )Tj
T*("What's so good about The JAMs", the magazine said, "is the way they are )Tj
T*(capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of )Tj
T*(1987 Britain".[5] )Tj
T*( NME's Danny Kelly was not so impressed. He also felt that the record was )Tj

T*("Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast )Tj

T*(on sampling culture ever made".[33] )Tj
T*( A retrospective review by Allmusic negatively commented that 1987 is "a )Tj

T*(Price Guide for Record &amp; CD Collectors called 1987 an "entirely brilliant )Tj
T*(example of the art of disc-jockey-as-producer".[34] Giving another )Tj

T*( The coronation of the British monarch is a ceremony \(specifically, initiation )Tj
T*(rite\) in which the monarch of the United Kingdom is formally crowned and )Tj
T*(invested with regalia. It corresponds to coronation ceremonies that formerly )Tj
T*(occurred in other European monarchies, which have currently abandoned )Tj
T*(coronations in favour of inauguration or enthronement ceremonies. )Tj
T*( The coronation usually takes place several months after the death of the )Tj
T*(previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be )Tj
T*(inappropriate when mourning still continues. This also gives planners enough )Tj
T*(time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Elizabeth II )Tj
T*(was crowned on 2Â June 1953, despite having ascended the throne on 6Â February )Tj
T*(1952, the instant her father died. The throne is not left vacant and the new )Tj
T*(monarch succeeds the old one immediately. )Tj
T*( The ceremony is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior )Tj
T*(cleric in the Church of England. Other clergy and members of the nobility also )Tj
T*(have roles; most participants in the ceremony are required to wear ceremonial )Tj
T*(uniforms or robes. Many other government officials and guests attend, including )Tj
T*(representatives of foreign countries. )Tj
T*( The essential elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for )Tj
T*(the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, )Tj
T*(the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold the law and the Church. )Tj
T*(Following that, the monarch is anointed with oil, crowned, and invested with )Tj
T*(the regalia, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The timing of the coronation has varied throughout British history. The first )Tj
T*(Norman monarch, William I "The Conqueror", was crowned on the day he became )Tj
T*(Kingâ€”25Â December 1066.[1] Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or )Tj
T*(even days, of their accession. Edward I was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when )Tj
T*(he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in )Tj
T*(1274.[2]Edward II's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in )Tj
T*(Scotland in 1307.[3]Henry VI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; )Tj
T*(he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government )Tj
T*(until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437.[4] Under the Hanoverian )Tj
T*(monarchs in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was deemed )Tj
T*(appropriate to extend the waiting period to several months, following a period )Tj
T*(of mourning for the previous monarch and to allow time for preparation of the )Tj
T*(ceremony.[5] In the case of every monarch since and including George IV, at )Tj
T*(least one year has passed between accession and coronation, with the exception )Tj
T*(of George VI, whose predecessor did not die but abdicated.[6] The coronation )Tj
T*(date had already been set; planning simply continued with a new monarch.[7] )Tj
T*( Since a period of time has often passed between accession and coronation, some )Tj
T*(monarchs were never crowned. Edward V and Lady Jane Grey were both deposed )Tj
T*(before they could be crowned, in 1483 and 1553, respectively.[8]Edward VIII )Tj
T*(also went uncrowned, as he abdicated in 1936 before the end of the customary )Tj
T*(one-year period between accession and coronation.[6] A monarch, however, )Tj
T*(accedes to the throne the moment their predecessor dies, not when they are )Tj
T*(crowned. i.e. "The King is dead. Long live the King."[9] )Tj

T*( The Anglo-Saxon monarchs used various locations for their coronations, )Tj
T*(including Bath, Kingston upon Thames, London, and Winchester. The last )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxon monarch, Harold II, was crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1066; the )Tj
T*(location was preserved for all future coronations.[10] The basic elements of )Tj
T*(the coronation ceremony have also remained the same for the last thousand )Tj
T*(years; it was devised in 973 by Dunstan.[5][11] When London was under the )Tj
T*(control of the French,[12]Henry III was crowned at Gloucester in 1216; he later )Tj
T*(chose to have a second coronation at Westminster in 1220.[13] Two hundred years )Tj
T*(later, Henry VI also had two coronations; as King of England in London in 1429, )Tj
T*(and as King of France in Paris in 1431.[4] )Tj
T*( Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but )Tj
T*(underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord )Tj
T*(Protector in 1657.[14] )Tj
T*( Coronations may be performed for a person other than the reigning monarch. In )Tj
T*(1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a )Tj
T*(second king of England, subordinate to his father Henry II;[15] such )Tj
T*(coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this is )Tj
T*(only one of two instances of its kind in England \(the other being that of )Tj
T*(Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still )Tj
T*(alive\).[16] More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the )Tj
T*(king is already married at the time of his coronation, a joint coronation of )Tj
T*(both king and queen may be performed.[5] The first such coronation was of Henry )Tj
T*(II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have )Tj
T*(been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and Mary II.[17] )Tj
T*(The most recent was that of GeorgeÂ VI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in )Tj
T*(1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife )Tj
T*(were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a )Tj
T*(separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in )Tj
T*(England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068;[18] the last was Anne Boleyn's )Tj
T*(in 1533.[19] The most recent King to wed post-coronation, Charles II, did not )Tj
T*(have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza.[20] )Tj
T*( Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 was televised by the British Broadcasting )Tj
T*(Corporation. Originally only events as far as the choir screen were to be )Tj
T*(televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any )Tj
T*(mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most )Tj
T*(of the main events of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live. This )Tj
T*(led to controversy in the press, and even questions in Parliament.[21] The )Tj
T*(decision was subsequently altered, and the entire ceremony televised, with the )Tj
T*(exception of the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from )Tj
T*(photography at the previous coronation. It was not revealed until 30 years )Tj
T*(later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the Queen. It )Tj
T*(is estimated that over twenty million individuals viewed the programme in the )Tj
T*(United Kingdom, an audience unprecedented in television history. The coronation )Tj
T*(greatly increased public interest in televisions.[22] )Tj
T*( The monarch is simultaneously crowned as sovereign of multiple nations; )Tj
T*(Elizabeth II was asked, for example: "Will you solemnly promise and swear to )Tj
T*(govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, )Tj
T*(Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, )Tj
T*(and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or )Tj
T*(pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?"[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Participants )Tj
T*( Attendees include foreign and Commonwealth dignitaries as well as Britons, )Tj
T*(some of whom will participate in the ceremony directly. For Elizabeth II's )Tj
T*(coronation in 1953, 7,500 guests were squeezed into the Abbey and each person )Tj
T*(had to make do with a maximum of 18 inches \(460Â mm\) of seating.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Clergy )Tj
T*( The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has precedence over all other clergymen and )Tj
T*(over all laymen except members of the Royal Family,[25] traditionally )Tj
T*(officiates at coronations;[26] during his absence, another bishop appointed by )Tj
T*(the monarch may take his place.[27] There have, however, been several )Tj

T*(exceptions. William I was crowned by the Archbishop of York, since the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury had been appointed by the Antipope Benedict X, and )Tj
T*(this appointment was not recognised as valid by the Pope.[28]Edward II was )Tj
T*(crowned by the Bishop of Winchester because the Archbishop of Canterbury had )Tj
T*(been exiled by Edward I.[29]Mary I, a Catholic, refused to be crowned by the )Tj
T*(Protestant Archbishop Thomas Cranmer; the coronation was instead performed by )Tj
T*(the Bishop of Winchester.[30] Finally, when James II was deposed and replaced )Tj
T*(with William III and Mary II jointly, the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to )Tj
T*(recognise the new Sovereigns; he had to be replaced by the Bishop of )Tj
T*(London.[31] Hence, in almost all cases where the Archbishop of Canterbury has )Tj
T*(failed to participate, his place has been taken by a senior cleric: the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of York is second in precedence, the Bishop of London third, the )Tj
T*(Bishop of Durham fourth, and the Bishop of Winchester fifth.[25]Elizabeth I was )Tj
T*(crowned by the Bishop of Carlisle \(to whose see is attached no special )Tj
T*(precedence\) because the senior prelates were "either dead, too old and infirm, )Tj
T*(unacceptable to the queen, or unwilling to serve".[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Great Officers of State )Tj
T*( The Great Officers of State traditionally participate during the ceremony. The )Tj
T*(offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable have not been regularly )Tj
T*(filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, )Tj
T*(revived for coronation ceremonies.[33][34] The Lord Great Chamberlain enrobes )Tj
T*(the Sovereign with the ceremonial vestments, with the aid of the Groom of the )Tj
T*(Robes and the Master \(in the case of a king\) or Mistress \(in the case of a )Tj
T*(queen\) of the Robes.[23] )Tj
T*( The Barons of the Cinque Ports also participated in the ceremony. Formerly, )Tj
T*(the Barons were the Members of the House of Commons representing the Cinque )Tj
T*(Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the )Tj
T*(nineteenth century, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular )Tj
T*(constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, Barons )Tj
T*(were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific )Tj
T*(purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the Barons were charged with )Tj
T*(bearing a ceremonial canopy over the Sovereign. The last time the Barons )Tj
T*(performed such a task was at the coronation of George IV in 1821. The Barons )Tj
T*(did not return for the coronations of William IV \(who insisted on a simpler, )Tj
T*(cheaper ceremonial\) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the Barons )Tj
T*(have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.[35] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other claims to attend the coronation )Tj
T*( Many landowners and other persons have honorific "duties" or privileges at the )Tj
T*(coronation. Such rights are determined by a special Court of Claims, over which )Tj
T*(the Lord High Steward traditionally presided. The first recorded Court of )Tj
T*(Claims was convened in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II. By the Tudor )Tj
T*(period, the hereditary post of Lord High Steward had merged with the Crown, and )Tj
T*(so Henry VIII began the modern tradition of naming a temporary Steward for the )Tj
T*(coronation only, with separate commissioners to carry out the actual work of )Tj
T*(the court.[33] )Tj
T*( In 1952, for example, the Court accepted the claim of the Dean of Westminster )Tj
T*(to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony \(for nearly a )Tj
T*(thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book )Tj
T*(of practices\), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of )Tj
T*(Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and )Tj
T*(to stand on either side of her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim )Tj
T*(of the Earl of Shrewsbury in his capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland to )Tj
T*(carry a white staff, and the claim of the Queen's Scholars of Westminster )Tj
T*(School to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people )Tj
T*(\(their shouts of "Vivat! Vivat Regina!" were incorporated into an anthem\).[36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sovereign's robes )Tj
T*( The Sovereign wears a variety of different robes and other garments during the )Tj
T*(course of the ceremony: )Tj
T*( Crimson surcoat â€“ the regular dress during most of the ceremony, worn under )Tj
T*(all other robes. In 1953, Elizabeth II wore a newly made gown in place of a )Tj

T*(surcoat.[37])Tj
T*(Robe of State of crimson velvet or Parliament Robe â€“ the first robe used at a )Tj
T*(coronation, worn on entry to the Abbey and later at State Openings of )Tj
T*(Parliament. It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined )Tj
T*(with further ermine and decorated with gold lace.[37])Tj
T*(Anointing gown â€“ a simple and austere garment worn during the anointing. It is )Tj
T*(plain white, bears no decoration and fastens at the back.[37])Tj
T*(Colobium sindonis \("shroud tunic"\) â€“ the first robe with which the Sovereign is )Tj
T*(invested. It is a loose white undergarment of fine linen cloth edged with a )Tj
T*(lace border, open at the sides, sleeveless and cut low at the neck. It )Tj
T*(symbolises the derivation of Royal authority from the people.[37])Tj
T*(Supertunica â€“ the second robe with which the Sovereign is invested. It is a )Tj
T*(long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing )Tj
T*(sleeves. It is lined with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven )Tj
T*(with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full )Tj
T*(dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.[37])Tj
T*(Robe Royal or Pallium Regale â€“ the main robe worn during the ceremony and used )Tj
T*(during the Crowning.[23] It is a four-square mantle, lined in crimson silk and )Tj
T*(decorated with silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in )Tj
T*(the four corners. It is lay, rather than liturgical, in nature.[37])Tj
T*(Stole Royal or armilla â€“ a gold silk scarf which accompanies the Robe Royal, )Tj
T*(richly and heavily embroidered with gold and silver thread, set with jewels and )Tj
T*(lined with rose-coloured silk and gold fringing.[37])Tj
T*(Purple surcoat â€“ the counterpart to the crimson surcoat, worn during the final )Tj
T*(part of the ceremony.[37])Tj
T*(Imperial Robe of purple velvet â€“ the robe worn at the conclusion of the )Tj
T*(ceremony, on exit from the Abbey. It comprises an embroidered ermine cape with )Tj
T*(a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian ermine and fully lined )Tj
T*(with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of Roman )Tj
T*(Emperors.[37])Tj
T*(  In contrast to the history and tradition which surround the Regalia, it is )Tj
T*(customary for most coronation robes to be newly made for each monarch. The )Tj
T*(present exceptions are the supertunica and Robe Royal, which both date from the )Tj
T*(coronation of George IV in 1821.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Official costume )Tj
T*( Several participants in the ceremony wear special costumes, uniforms or robes. )Tj
T*(Peers' robes comprise a full-length crimson velvet coat, and an ermine cape. )Tj
T*(Rows of sealskin spots on the cape designate the peer's rank; dukes use four )Tj
T*(rows, marquesses three and a half, earls three, viscounts two and a half, and )Tj
T*(barons and lords of Parliament two. Royal dukes use six rows of ermine, ermine )Tj
T*(on the front of the cape and long trains borne by pages. Peeresses' ranks are )Tj
T*(designated not by sealskin spots, but by the length of their trains and the )Tj
T*(width of the ermine edging on the same. For duchesses, the trains are two yards )Tj
T*(\(2Â m\) long, for marchionesses one and three-quarters yards, for countesses one )Tj
T*(and a half yards, for viscountesses one and a quarter yards, and for baronesses )Tj
T*(and ladies one yard \(1Â m\). The ermine edgings are five inches \(127Â mm\) in width )Tj
T*(for duchesses, four inches \(102Â mm\) for marchionesses, three inches \(76Â mm\) for )Tj
T*(countesses, and two inches for viscountesses, baronesses and ladies. The robes )Tj
T*(of peers and peeresses are used only during coronations.[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Crowns and coronets )Tj
T*( Peers wear coronets, as do most members of the Royal Family; such coronets )Tj
T*(display heraldic emblems based on rank or association to the monarch. The )Tj

T*(marquesses four strawberry leaves alternating with four raised silver balls, )Tj
T*(those of earls eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight raised silver )Tj
T*(balls, those of viscounts sixteen silver balls and those of barons six silver )Tj
T*(balls. Peeresses use the same design, except that they appear on smaller )Tj
T*(circlets than the peers' coronets.[40] )Tj
T*( Aside from kings and queens, the only individuals authorised to wear crowns )Tj
T*(\(as opposed to coronets\) are the Kings of Arms, the United Kingdom's senior )Tj
T*(heraldic officials.[41]Garter, Clarenceaux, and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms )Tj
T*(have heraldic jurisdiction over England, Wales and Northern Ireland;[42] Lord )Tj
T*(Lyon King of Arms is responsible for Scotland.[43] In addition, there is a King )Tj
T*(of Arms attached to each of the Order of the Bath, Order of St. Michael and St. )Tj
T*(George and the Order of the British Empire. These have only a ceremonial role, )Tj
T*(but are authorised by the statutes of their orders to wear the same crown as )Tj
T*(Garter at a coronation.[44] The crown of a King of Arms is silver-gilt and )Tj
T*(consists of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, and inscribed with )Tj
T*(the words Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam \(Latin: "Have )Tj
T*(mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy", from Psalm 51\).[41] The Lord )Tj
T*(Lyon King of Arms has worn a crown of this style at all coronations since that )Tj
T*(of George III. Prior to that he wore a replica of the Crown of Scotland. In )Tj
T*(2004 a new replica of this crown was created for use by the Lord Lyon at future )Tj
T*(coronations.[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other participants )Tj
T*( Along with persons of nobility, the coronation ceremonies are also attended by )Tj
T*(a wide range of political figures, including the Prime Minister and all members )Tj
T*(of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, all Governors-General and Prime Ministers )Tj
T*(of the Commonwealth realms, all Governors of British Crown Colonies, as well as )Tj
T*(the Heads of State of dependent nations. Dignitaries and representatives from )Tj
T*(other nations are also customarily invited.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recognition and oath )Tj
T*( The Sovereign enters Westminster Abbey wearing the crimson surcoat and the )Tj
T*(Robe of State of crimson velvet. )Tj
T*( Once the Sovereign takes his or her seat on the Chair of Estate, the Garter )Tj
T*(Principal King of Arms, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the )Tj
T*(Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Constable and the Earl Marshal go to the )Tj
T*(east, south, west and north of the Abbey. At each side, the Archbishop calls )Tj
T*(for the Recognition of the Sovereign, with the words, "Sirs, I here present )Tj
T*(unto you ..., your undoubted King. Wherefore all you who are come this day to )Tj
T*(do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?" After the people )Tj
T*(acclaim the Sovereign at each side, the Archbishop administers an oath to the )Tj
T*(Sovereign.[23] Since the Glorious Revolution, the Coronation Oath Act of 1688 )Tj
T*(has required, among other things, that the Sovereign "Promise and Sweare to )Tj
T*(Governe the People of this Kingdome of England and the Dominions thereto )Tj
T*(belonging according to the Statutes in Parlyament Agreed on and the Laws and )Tj
T*(Customs of the same".[46] The oath has been modified without statutory )Tj
T*(authority; for example, at the coronation of Elizabeth II, the exchange between )Tj
T*(the Queen and the Archbishop was as follows: )Tj
T*( The Archbishop of Canterbury: "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern )Tj
T*(the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, )Tj
T*(Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, )Tj
T*(and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or )Tj
T*(pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?")Tj
T*(The Queen: "I solemnly promise so to do.")Tj
T*(The Archbishop of Canterbury: "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in )Tj
T*(Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?")Tj
T*(The Queen: "I will.")Tj
T*(The Archbishop of Canterbury: "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain )Tj
T*(the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost )Tj
T*(of your power maintain in the United Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion )Tj
T*(established by law? Will you maintain and preserve inviolable the settlement of )Tj
T*(the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government )Tj

T*(thereof, as by law established in England? And will you preserve unto the )Tj
T*(Bishops and Clergy of England, and to the Churches there committed to their )Tj
T*(charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them )Tj
T*(or any of them?")Tj
T*(The Queen: "All this I promise to do. The things which I have here before )Tj
T*(promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God."[23])Tj
T*(  The monarch additionally swears an oath to preserve Presbyterian church )Tj
T*(government in the Church of Scotland. This part of the oath is taken before the )Tj
T*(coronation.[27] )Tj
T*( Once the taking of the oath concludes, an ecclesiastic presents a Bible to the )Tj
T*(Sovereign, saying "Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively )Tj
T*(Oracles of God."[23] The Bible used is a full King James Bible, including the )Tj
T*(Apocrypha.[47] At Elizabeth II's coronation, the Bible was presented by the )Tj
T*(Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Once the Bible is )Tj
T*(presented, the Holy Communion is celebrated, but the service is interrupted )Tj
T*(after the Nicene Creed.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Anointing and crowning )Tj
T*( After the Communion service is interrupted, the crimson robe is removed, and )Tj
T*(the Sovereign proceeds to King Edward's Chair,[23] which has been set in a most )Tj
T*(prominent position, wearing the anointing gown. \(In 1953, King Edward's Chair )Tj
T*(stood atop a dais of several steps.\)[48] This mediaeval chair has a slot in the )Tj
T*(base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as )Tj
T*(the "stone of destiny", it was used for ancient Scottish coronations until )Tj
T*(brought to England by Edward I. It has been used for every coronation at )Tj
T*(Westminster Abbey since. Until 1996 the stone was kept with the chair in )Tj
T*(Westminster Abbey between coronations, but it was returned that year to )Tj
T*(Scotland, where it will remain on display in Edinburgh Castle until it is )Tj
T*(needed for a coronation.[49] )Tj
T*( Once seated in this chair, a canopy is held over the monarch's head for the )Tj
T*(anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent )Tj
T*(coronations by four Knights of the Garter.[23] This element of the coronation )Tj
T*(service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze;[50] it was not )Tj
T*(photographed in 1937 or televised in 1953. The Dean of Westminster pours )Tj
T*(consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a spoon with which the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the Sovereign on the hands, head, and )Tj
T*(heart.[23] The filigreed spoon is the only part of the mediaeval crown jewels )Tj
T*(which survived the commonwealth.[51] The Archbishop concludes by reciting a )Tj
T*(blessing.[23] )Tj
T*( The Sovereign is then enrobed in the colobium sindonis, over which is placed )Tj
T*(the supertunica.[23] )Tj
T*( The Lord Great Chamberlain presents the spurs,[23] which represent )Tj
T*(chivalry.[51] The Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by other bishops, then )Tj
T*(presents the Sword of State to the Sovereign. The Sovereign is then further )Tj
T*(robed, this time putting the Robe Royal and Stole Royal on top of the )Tj
T*(supertunica. The Archbishop then delivers several Crown Jewels to the )Tj
T*(Sovereign. First, he delivers the Orb,[23] a hollow golden sphere set with )Tj
T*(numerous precious and semi-precious stones. The Orb is surmounted by a cross, )Tj
T*(representing the rule of Jesus over the world;[52] it is returned to the Altar )Tj
T*(immediately after being received.[23] Next, the Sovereign receives a ring )Tj
T*(representing the "marriage" between him or her and the nation.[53] The Sceptre )Tj
T*(with the Dove \(so called because it is surmounted by a dove representing the )Tj
T*(Holy Spirit\) and the Sceptre with the Cross \(which incorporates Cullinan I\) are )Tj
T*(delivered to the Sovereign.[54] As the Sovereign holds the two sceptres, the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury places St Edward's Crown on his or her head. All cry )Tj
T*("God Save the King [Queen]", placing their coronets and caps on their heads. )Tj
T*(Cannons are fired from the Tower of London.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] End of the ceremony )Tj
T*( The Sovereign is then borne into the Throne. The Archbishops and Bishops swear )Tj
T*(their fealty, saying "I, N., Archbishop [Bishop] of N., will be faithful and )Tj
T*(true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord [Lady], King )Tj

T*([Queen] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and )Tj
T*(successors according to law. So help me God." The peers then proceed to pay )Tj
T*(their homage, saying "I, N., Duke [Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron or Lord] of )Tj
T*(N., do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and )Tj
T*(faith and truth will I bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of )Tj
T*(folks. So help me God."[23] The clergy pay homage together, led by the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, members of the Royal Family pay homage )Tj
T*(individually. The peers are led by the premier peers of their rank: the Dukes )Tj
T*(by the Premier Duke, the Marquesses by the Premier Marquess, and so forth.[23] )Tj
T*( If there is a queen consort, she is anointed and crowned in a simple ceremony )Tj
T*(immediately after homage is paid. The Communion ceremony interrupted earlier is )Tj
T*(resumed and completed.[5] )Tj
T*( The Sovereign then exits the Coronation Theatre, entering St Edward's Chapel )Tj
T*(\(also within the Abbey\), preceded by the bearers of the Sword of State, the )Tj
T*(Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice and the Sword of )Tj
T*(Mercy \(the last has a blunt tip\).[55] The Crown and Sceptres worn by the )Tj
T*(Sovereign, as well as all other regalia, are laid at the Altar;[23] the )Tj
T*(Sovereign removes the Robe Royal and Stole Royal, exchanges the crimson surcoat )Tj
T*(for the purple surcoat[37] and is enrobed in the Imperial Robe of purple )Tj
T*(velvet. He or she then wears the Imperial State Crown and takes into his or her )Tj
T*(hands the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb and leaves the chapel while all )Tj
T*(present sing the National Anthem.[23] )Tj
T*( Music played at coronations is primarily classical and religiously inspired. )Tj
T*(The most oft-used piece is Zadok the Priest, a religious composition by George )Tj
T*(Frideric Handel based on texts from the Bible. The work was commissioned for )Tj
T*(George II's coronation in 1727, and has featured in every coronation since, an )Tj
T*(achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Hubert Parry's I Was Glad was )Tj
T*(written as the entrance anthem for the coronation of Edward VII, and contains a )Tj
T*(bridge section partway through so that the King's or Queen's Scholars of )Tj
T*(Westminster School can exercise their right to be the first commoners to )Tj
T*(acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional "vivat"s as he or she enters )Tj
T*(the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford's Gloria in )Tj
T*(Excelsis have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the )Tj
T*(national anthem, God Save the Queen \(or King\).[56] Other composers whose music )Tj
T*(featured in Elizabeth II's coronation include Sir George Dyson, Gordon Jacob, )Tj
T*(Sir William Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, Sir William Walton, Samuel Sebastian )Tj
T*(Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born )Tj
T*(Healey Willan.[57] Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn )Tj
T*(be included. This was approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan )Tj
T*(Williams recast his 1928 setting of the English metrical version of Psalm 100, )Tj
T*(the Jubilate Deo \("All people that on earth do dwell"\) for congregation, organ )Tj
T*(and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the )Tj
T*(Anglophone world.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Coronation banquet )Tj
T*( Traditionally, the coronation was immediately followed by a banquet, held in )Tj
T*(Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster \(which also serves as the home to )Tj
T*(the Houses of Parliament\). The King or Queen's Champion \(the office being held )Tj
T*(by the Dymoke family in connection with the Manor of Scrivelsby\) would ride )Tj
T*(into the hall on horseback, wearing a knight's armour, with the Lord High )Tj
T*(Constable riding to his right and the Earl Marshal riding to his left. A herald )Tj
T*(would then make a proclamation of the readiness of the Champion to fight anyone )Tj
T*(denying the monarch. After 1800, the form for this was as follows:[59] )Tj
T*( "If any person, of what degree soever, high or low, shall deny or gainsay our )Tj
T*(Sovereign Lord ..., King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, )Tj
T*(Defender of the Faith, son and next heir unto our Sovereign Lord the last King )Tj
T*(deceased, to be the right heir to the Imperial Crown of this Realm of Great )Tj
T*(Britain and Ireland, or that he ought not to enjoy the same; here is his )Tj
T*(Champion, who saith that he lieth, and is a false traitor, being ready in )Tj
T*(person to combat with him; and in this quarrel will adventure his life against )Tj
T*(him, on what day soever he shall be appointed."[59])Tj

T*(  The King's Champion would then throw down the gauntlet; the ceremony would be )Tj
T*(repeated at the centre of the hall and at the High Table \(where the Sovereign )Tj
T*(would be seated\). The Sovereign would then drink to the Champion from a gold )Tj
T*(cup, which he would then present to the latter.[59] )Tj
T*( The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master )Tj
T*(Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet.[60] )Tj
T*( Banquets have not been held since the coronation of George IV in 1821. George )Tj
T*(IV's coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor )Tj
T*(William IV eliminated the banquet, and William's desire to eliminate the costly )Tj
T*(banquet has now apparently become the custom.[61] A banquet was considered in )Tj
T*(1902 for Edward VII but his sudden illness put a stop to the plans.[60] In )Tj
T*(1953, the dish Coronation Chicken was created for the informal meal served to )Tj
T*(the guests.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dates of recent coronations )Tj
T*( [edit] Enthronement as Emperor )Tj
T*( Victoria assumed the title Empress of India in 1876.[62] A durbar \(court\) was )Tj
T*(held at Delhi on 1Â January 1877 to proclaim the assumption of the title. )Tj
T*(Victoria did not attend personally, but was represented by the Viceroy, Lord )Tj
T*(Lytton.[63] A similar durbar was held on 1Â January 1903 to celebrate the )Tj
T*(accession of Edward VII, who was represented by his brother the Duke of )Tj
T*(Connaught.[64] In 1911, George V also held a coronation durbar; however, he and )Tj
T*(his wife attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for the )Tj
T*(Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian )Tj
T*(nation, George V was not crowned in India; instead, he wore a crown as he )Tj
T*(entered the Durbar. The law prohibited the removal of the British Crown Jewels )Tj
T*(from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the Imperial )Tj
T*(Crown of India, was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian )Tj
T*(princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain political decisions, such as )Tj
T*(the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the )Tj
T*(Durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by )Tj
T*(George VI in 1948 \(though India had become independent a year earlier\).[65] )Tj

T*( Richard Barre \(c. 1130Â â€“ c. 1202\) was a medieval English justice, clergyman )Tj
T*(and scholar. He was educated at the law school of Bologna and entered royal )Tj
T*(service under King Henry II of England, later working for Henry's son and )Tj
T*(successor Richard I. He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son Henry )Tj
T*(the Young King. Barre served the elder Henry as a diplomat and was involved in )Tj
T*(a minor way with the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, which earned Barre a )Tj
T*(condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal )Tj
T*(justice during Richard's reign and was one of the main judges in the period )Tj
T*(from 1194 to 1199. After disagreeing with him earlier in his career, Barre was )Tj
T*(discharged from his judgeship during John's reign as king. Barre was also )Tj
T*(archdeacon of Ely and the author of a work of biblical extracts dedicated to )Tj
T*(one of his patrons, William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of )Tj
T*(England. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Whether Barre was a native of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his )Tj
T*(surname appears to derive from the Norman village of La Barre, near Bernay, in )Tj
T*(the present-day department of Eure.[1] He was likely born around 1130[2] and )Tj
T*(was related to Normandy's Sifrewast family,[a] knights in Berkshire. Barre had )Tj
T*(a relative, Hugh Barre, who was Archdeacon of Leicester in the 1150s. Barre )Tj
T*(studied law at Bologna in Italy before 1150 and was a student there with )Tj
T*(Stephen of Tournai, who became Bishop of Tournai in 1192.[1] Another fellow )Tj
T*(student wrote a short verse addressed to Barre: "Pontificum causas regumque )Tj
T*(negocia tractes, Qui tibi divicias deliciasque parant", which translates to )Tj
T*("May you manage the causes of bishops and the affairs of kings, Who provide )Tj
T*(riches and delights for you."[3] After finishing his schooling, Barre seems to )Tj
T*(have worked for either Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln, or Nicholas, )Tj
T*(Archdeacon of Huntingdon; the main evidence for this is that Barre witnessed )Tj
T*(charters for both men from 1160 to 1164. By 1165, Barre had joined the )Tj
T*(household of King Henry II of England.[1] )Tj

T*( [edit] Service to King Henry )Tj
T*( Barre served King Henry during the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury, who had gone into exile in 1164 over the dispute )Tj
T*(about the limits of royal authority over the English Church.[4] Because of )Tj
T*(Barre's close ties to King Henry, Becket considered him one of the king's "evil )Tj
T*(counselors", and Barre was the subject of denunciations by the archbishop.[5] )Tj
T*(In late August 1169, Barre was in Normandy with Henry, where Barre was part of )Tj
T*(a group of ecclesiastics advising the king on how to resolve the Becket )Tj
T*(dispute.[6][b] In September 1169, Barre was sent along with two other clerks to )Tj
T*(Rome to complain about the behaviour of papal envoys during negotiations with )Tj
T*(Becket held at the beginning of September. The papal negotiators at first )Tj
T*(agreed to a compromise, but the next day claimed that the proposal was )Tj
T*(unacceptable. With the failure of the negotiations, Becket restored the )Tj
T*(sentences of excommunication on a number of royal officials, but Barre was not )Tj
T*(included among those specifically named even though many of his colleagues )Tj
T*(were. The historian Frank Barlow argues that Barre was not specifically named )Tj
T*(in the restoration of excommunications, as Becket considered him already )Tj
T*(excommunicated because of his association with those under the church's ban.[7] )Tj
T*( During January and February 1170 the king sent Barre on a diplomatic mission )Tj
T*(to the pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket.[5] )Tj
T*(The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those )Tj
T*(whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful;[2] rumours )Tj
T*(circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the )Tj
T*(coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When )Tj
T*(Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation of the right of the )Tj
T*(archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such )Tj
T*(permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who )Tj
T*(crowned Henry's heir.[8] Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal )Tj
T*(agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no )Tj
T*(written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.[9][c] )Tj
T*( After Becket's murder in December 1170[4] King Henry sent Barre to Rome, )Tj
T*(accompanied by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Ã‰vreux and Worcester, )Tj
T*(and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy.[10] The )Tj
T*(mission's objective was to make it clear to Alexander that Henry had had )Tj
T*(nothing to do with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had )Tj
T*(taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but )Tj
T*(eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope.[2] Although the )Tj
T*(mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade )Tj
T*(the papacy not to impose an interdict, or ban on clerical rites, on England or )Tj
T*(to excommunicate the king.[5][11] Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the )Tj
T*(office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome )Tj
T*(in 1171.[5] In September he was named a royal justice.[12] He was named )Tj
T*(chancellor to King Henry's eldest living son Henry for a brief period in 1172 )Tj
T*(and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought )Tj
T*(refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and )Tj
T*(returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's )Tj
T*(seal.[5] )Tj
T*( In addition to the Lisieux archdeaconry, Barre held the prebend of Hurstborne )Tj
T*(and Burbage in the Diocese of Salisbury from 1177[13] and the prebend of )Tj
T*(Moreton and Whaddon in the Diocese of Hereford from 1180 through 1184.[14] He )Tj
T*(continued to hold the archdeaconry at Lisieux until 1188,[15] and was at )Tj
T*(Lisieux for most of the late 1170s and 1180s.[16] In 1179 he was at Rouen for )Tj
T*(the display of the body of Saint Romanus and was one of the witnesses to the )Tj
T*(event. While holding his Norman archdeaconry, he gave land to the abbey of )Tj
T*(St-Pierre-sur-Dives along with Ralph, Bishop of Lisieux.[17] In 1187, King )Tj
T*(Henry sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the continent with letters to the )Tj
T*(German Emperor, the King of Hungary, and the Emperor at Constantinople, seeking )Tj
T*(assistance for his projected crusade,[18] but Henry died in 1189 before the )Tj
T*(crusade could set off.[19] )Tj

T*( After the death of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, )Tj
T*(the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre )Tj
T*(as Archdeacon of Ely,[20] with the appointment occurring before 4 July )Tj
T*(1190.[15] Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in )Tj
T*(1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the )Tj
T*(hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during )Tj
T*(Richard's absence on the Third Crusade.[21] Longchamp's exile meant that Barre )Tj
T*(did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England )Tj
T*(in 1194.[20] Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he did not )Tj
T*(return to his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have )Tj
T*(devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.[22][d] )Tj
T*( Barre was one of the main royal justices between 1194 and 1199.[20] He also )Tj
T*(served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, Eustace,[16] who was elected in )Tj
T*(August 1197.[25] But Barre had incurred the hostility of the king's younger )Tj
T*(brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre )Tj
T*(ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business )Tj
T*(in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 )Tj
T*(August 1202,[26] when he was serving as a judge-delegate for Pope Innocent )Tj
T*(III,[16] but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal )Tj
T*(panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and )Tj
T*(1213.[26] Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who )Tj
T*(corresponded with him later in their lives.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Literary work )Tj
T*( Barre wrote a work on the Bible entitled Compendium de veteri et novo )Tj
T*(testamento, which he dedicated to William Longchamp. The work arranged passages )Tj
T*(from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal )Tj
T*(notations such as were done with glosses on Roman law.[27] It is still extant )Tj
T*(in two manuscript \(MS\) copies, MS British Library Harley 3255, and Lambeth )Tj
T*(Palace MS 105.[2] The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. )Tj
T*(Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the )Tj
T*(Harley manuscript "provides [a] well structured and systematic \(though not )Tj
T*(complete\) coverage of the whole Bible." Because of the dedication to William )Tj
T*(Longchamp as "bishop, legate, and chancellor", it is likely that the work was )Tj
T*(composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those )Tj
T*(three offices together during that period.[22] The prologue to the work )Tj
T*(describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it )Tj
T*(was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have )Tj
T*(intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.[28] )Tj
T*( A third copy of Barre's Compendium may have existed at Leicester Abbey, where )Tj
T*(a late 15th-century library catalogue records a work by Barre on the Bible that )Tj
T*(the catalogue titles "Compendium Ricardi Barre super utroque testamento". The )Tj
T*(title and contents make this manuscript likely to be a copy of the Compendium. )Tj
T*(The same catalogue also records five books once owned by BarreÂ â€“ copies of )Tj
T*(Gratian's Decretum, Justinian's Codex, glossed copies of the Psalter and some )Tj
T*(of the Epistles of Paul, as well as Peter Lombard's Sentences. Also, another )Tj
T*(Leicester Abbey manuscript records some satirical verses that were said to have )Tj
T*(been written by Barre.[28] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ^ The Sifrewast family was from Normandy, near the place called now )Tj
T*(Chiffrevast at Tamerville near Valognes.[2])Tj
T*(^ This group advising the king included two continental archbishopsÂ â€“ from )Tj
T*(Rouen and Bordeaux, a number of bishopsÂ â€“ including all the Norman bishops, )Tj
T*(other French bishops and an English bishop, and abbots from Norman, Breton, and )Tj
T*(English monasteries. The assemblage was rounded out by scholars such as )Tj
T*(Geoffrey of Auxerre and royal clerks such as Geoffrey Ridel and John of Oxford. )Tj
T*(However, although Gilbert Foliot, one of the main opponents of Becket was in )Tj
T*(the area, he was not able to consult with the king because he was )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the Connecticut )Tj
T*(Land Company laid out Connecticut's Western Reserve into townships and a )Tj
T*(capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General Moses )Tj
T*(Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern )Tj
T*(downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to )Tj
T*(visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a )Tj
T*(cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was )Tj
T*(incorporated on December 23, 1814.[9] In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands )Tj
T*(and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area )Tj
T*(began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This )Tj
T*(key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the )Tj
T*(Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway; and )Tj
T*(the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Growth continued with added )Tj
T*(railroad links.[15] Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.[9] )Tj
T*( In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga )Tj
T*(River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a )Tj
T*(bridge connecting the two.[16] Ohio City remained an independent municipality )Tj
T*(until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854.[9] )Tj
T*( The city's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes )Tj
T*(has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. )Tj
T*(Cleveland serves as a destination point for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, as )Tj
T*(well as coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard )Tj
T*(Oil in Cleveland, and moved its headquarters to New York City in 1885.[17] )Tj
T*(Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as an important American )Tj
T*(manufacturing center, which included automotive companies such as Peerless, )Tj
T*(People's,[18]Jordan, and Winton, maker of the first car driven across the )Tj
T*(U.S.[19] Other manufacturers located in Cleveland produced steam-powered cars, )Tj
T*(which included White and Gaeth, as well as the electric car company Baker. By )Tj
T*(1920, due in large part to the city's economic prosperity, Cleveland became the )Tj
T*(nation's fifth largest city.[9] The city counted Progressive Era politicians )Tj
T*(such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. Many prominent )Tj
T*(Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic Lake View Cemetery, )Tj
T*(including President James A. Garfield,[20] and John D. Rockefeller. )Tj
T*( In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the )Tj

T*(into a financial default on federal loans since the Great Depression.[9] )Tj
T*(Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial )Tj
T*(difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the )Tj
T*(city. This, along with the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew )Tj
T*(negative national press; as a result, Cleveland was often derided as "The )Tj
T*(Mistake on the Lake".[29] )Tj
T*( By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in )Tj

T*(contributed to the recession that impacted cities like Cleveland.[30] While )Tj
T*(unemployment during the period peaked in 1983,[31] Cleveland's rate of 13.8% )Tj

T*(and improvement of the school systems are municipal priorities.[36] In 1999, )Tj
T*(Cleveland was identified as an emerging global city.[37] )Tj
T*( In the 21st century, the city has improved infrastructure, is more )Tj

T*(example of revitalization. In studies conducted by The Economist in 2005 )Tj
T*(Cleveland was ranked as one of the most livable cities in the United )Tj

T*(the continental U.S.[39] The city's goals include additional neighborhood )Tj
T*(revitalization and increased funding for public education.[40] )Tj
T*( [edit] Geography )Tj
T*( [edit] Topography )Tj
T*( According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of )Tj
T*(82.47 square miles \(213.60Â km2\), of which, 77.70 square miles \(201.24Â km2\) is )Tj
T*(land and 4.77 square miles \(12.35Â km2\) is water.[1] The shore of Lake Erie is )Tj
T*(569 feet \(173Â m\) above sea level; however, the city lies on a series of )Tj
T*(irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs )Tj
T*(are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River, Big Creek, and Euclid Creek. The )Tj
T*(land rises quickly from the lakeshore. Public Square, less than a mile \(2Â km\) )Tj
T*(inland, sits at an elevation of 650 feet \(198Â m\), and Hopkins Airport, only 5 )Tj
T*(miles \(8Â km\) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 791 feet \(241Â m\).[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Climate )Tj
T*( Typical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a continental climate )Tj
T*(with four distinct seasons, which lies in the humid continental \(KÃ¶ppen )Tj
T*(Dfa\)[42] zone. Summers are hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The )Tj
T*(Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the )Tj

T*(northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow )Tj
T*(that is typical in Cleveland \(especially on the city's East Side\) from )Tj
T*(mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or )Tj
T*(early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in )Tj

T*( Ailanthus altissima \(pron.: /eÉªËˆlÃ¦nÎ¸É™s Ã¦lËˆtÉªsÉ¨mÉ™/\),[2] commonly known as tree )Tj
T*(of heaven, ailanthus, or in Standard Chinese as chouchun \(Chinese: è‡­æ¤¿; )Tj
T*(pinyin: chÃ²uchÅ«n; literally "foul smelling tree"\), is a deciduous tree in the )Tj
T*(Simaroubaceae family. It is native to both northeast and central China and )Tj
T*(Taiwan. Unlike other members of the genus Ailanthus, it is found in temperate )Tj
T*(climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of )Tj
T*(reaching heights of 15 metres \(49Â ft\) in 25Â years. However, the species is also )Tj
T*(short lived and rarely lives more than 50Â years. )Tj
T*( In China, the tree of heaven has a long and rich history. It was mentioned in )Tj
T*(the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical )Tj
T*(texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to )Tj
T*(baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional )Tj
T*(Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown )Tj
T*(extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus )Tj
T*(silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has become a part of )Tj
T*(western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and )Tj
T*(subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by )Tj
T*(Betty Smith. )Tj
T*( The tree was first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s and to the United )Tj
T*(States in 1784. It was one of the first trees brought west during a time when )Tj
T*(chinoiserie was dominating European arts, and was initially hailed as a )Tj
T*(beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners )Tj
T*(became familiar with its suckering habits and its foul smelling odour. Despite )Tj
T*(this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. )Tj
T*(Outside of Europe and the United States, the plant has been spread to many )Tj
T*(other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an )Tj
T*(invasive species due to its ability both to colonise disturbed areas quickly, )Tj
T*(including areas of rubble in war-torn Afghanistan, and to suppress competition )Tj

T*(difficult and time consuming. In many urban areas, it has acquired the derisive )Tj
T*(nicknames of "ghetto palm" and "stink tree". )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( A. altissima is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27Â )Tj
T*(metres \(56 and 90Â ft\) with a diameter at breast height of about 1Â metre \(40Â )Tj
T*(in\).[3] The bark is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with )Tj
T*(light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly )Tj
T*(pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have lenticels as well as )Tj
T*(heart-shaped leaf scars \(i.e. a scar left on the twig after a leaf falls\) with )Tj
T*(many bundle scars \(i.e. small marks where the veins of the leaf once connected )Tj
T*(to the tree\) around the edges. The buds are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and )Tj
T*(partially hidden behind the petiole, though they are completely visible in the )Tj
T*(dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.[4] The branches are light to )Tj
T*(dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous, and containing raised lenticels that )Tj
T*(become fissures with age. The ends of the branches become pendulous. All parts )Tj
T*(of the plant have a distinguishing strong odour that is often likened to )Tj
T*(peanuts, cashews,[5] or rotting cashews.[6] )Tj
T*( The leaves are large, odd- or even-pinnately compound, and arranged )Tj
T*(alternately on the stem. They range in size from 30 to 90 cm \(0.98 to 3.0 ft\) )Tj
T*(in length and contain 10â€“41 leaflets organised in pairs, with the largest )Tj
T*(leaves found on vigorous young sprouts. The rachis is light to reddish-green )Tj
T*(with a swollen base. The leaflets are ovate-lanceolate with entire margins, )Tj
T*(somewhat asymmetric and occasionally not directly opposite to each others. Each )Tj
T*(leaflet is 5 to 18 cm \(2.0 to 7.1 in\) long and 2.5 to 5 cm \(0.98 to 2.0 in\) )Tj
T*(wide. They have a long tapering end while the bases have two to four teeth, )Tj
T*(each containing one or more glands at the tip.[4] The leaflets' upper sides are )Tj
T*(dark green in colour with light green veins, while the undersides are a more )Tj
T*(whitish green. The petioles are 5 to 12 mm \(0.20 to 0.47 in\) long.[5] The lobed )Tj
T*(bases and glands distinguish it from similar sumac species. )Tj
T*( The flowers are small and appear in large panicles up to 50Â cm \(20Â in\) in )Tj
T*(length at the end of new shoots. The individual flowers are yellowish green to )Tj
T*(reddish in colour, each with five petals and sepals.[3][5] The sepals are )Tj
T*(cup-shaped, lobed and united while the petals are valvate \(i.e. they meet at )Tj
T*(the edges without overlapping\), white and hairy towards the inside.[4][7][8] )Tj
T*(They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. A. )Tj
T*(altissima is dioecious, with male and female flowers being borne on different )Tj
T*(individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the )Tj
T*(females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the male plants )Tj
T*(emit a foul-smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. )Tj
T*(Female flowers contain ten \(or rarely five through abortion\) sterile stamens )Tj
T*(\(stamenoides\) with heart-shaped anthers. The pistil is made up of five free )Tj
T*(carpels \(i.e. they are not fused\), each containing a single ovule. Their styles )Tj
T*(are united and slender with star-shaped stigmas.[4][7] The male flowers are )Tj
T*(similar in appearance, but they of course lack a pistil and the stamens do )Tj
T*(function, each being topped with a globular anther and a glandular green )Tj
T*(disc.[4] The seeds borne on the female trees are 5Â mm in diameter and each is )Tj
T*(encapsulated in a samara that is 2.5Â cm long \(1Â in\) and 1Â cm \(0.39Â in\) broad, )Tj
T*(appearing July though August, but can persist on the tree until the next )Tj
T*(spring. The samara is large and twisted at the tips, making it spin as it )Tj
T*(falls, assisting wind dispersal,[3][5] and aiding buoyancy for long-distance )Tj
T*(dispersal through hydrochory.[9] The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, )Tj
T*(normally around 30,000 per kilogram \(14,000/lb\) of tree,[3] and fecundity can )Tj
T*(be estimated non-destructively through measurements of dbh.[9] )Tj

T*(botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville )Tj
T*(were thought to be from the economically important and similar looking Chinese )Tj
T*(varnish tree \(Toxicodendron vernicifluum\), which he had observed in the lower )Tj
T*(Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. D'Incarville attached a note )Tj
T*(indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few )Tj
T*(decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to )Tj
T*(Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip )Tj
T*(C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.[4] )Tj
T*( Confusion in naming began when the tree was described by all three men with )Tj
T*(three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus )Tj
T*(succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the )Tj
T*(specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it )Tj
T*(was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There )Tj
T*(are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between )Tj
T*(Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge. Rather )Tj
T*(than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob )Tj
T*(Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus )Tj
T*(cacodendron.[4] )Tj
T*( Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when RenÃ© Louiche )Tj
T*(Desfontaines observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still )Tj
T*(labelled Rhus succedanea, and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a )Tj
T*(sumac. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the )Tj
T*(name Ailanthus glandulosa, placing it in the same genus as the tropical species )Tj
T*(then known as A. integrifolia \(white siris, now A. triphysa\). The name is )Tj
T*(derived from the Ambonese word ailanto, meaning "heaven-tree" or "tree reaching )Tj
T*(for the sky".[4][10] The specific glandulosa, referring to the glands on the )Tj
T*(leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as )Tj
T*(a later homonym at the species level.[4] The current species name comes from )Tj
T*(Walter T. Swingle who was employed by the United States Department of Plant )Tj
T*(Industry. He decided to transfer Miller's older specific name into the genus of )Tj
T*(Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name Ailanthus altissima.[11]Altissima )Tj
T*(is Latin for "tallest",[12] and refers to the sizes the tree can reach. The )Tj
T*(plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the specific epithet in the masculine )Tj
T*(\(glandulosus or altissimus\), which is incorrect since botanical, like Classical )Tj
T*(Latin, treats most tree names as feminine. )Tj
T*( There are three varieties of A. altissima: )Tj
T*( A. altissima var. altissima, which is the type variety and is native to )Tj
T*(mainland China.)Tj
T*(A. altissima var. tanakai, which is endemic to northern Taiwan highlands. It )Tj
T*(differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are )Tj
T*(also shorter on average at 45 to 60 cm \(18 to 24 in\) long with only 13â€“25 )Tj
T*(scythe-like leaflets.[13][14][15] It is listed as endangered in the IUCN Red )Tj
T*(List of threatened species due to loss of habitat for building and industrial )Tj
T*(plantations.[16])Tj
T*(A. altissima var. sutchuenensis, which differs in having red branchlets.[13][14])Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( A. altissima is native to northern and central China, Taiwan[17] and northern )Tj
T*(Korea.[18] In Taiwan it is present as var. takanai.[16] In China it is native )Tj
T*(to every province except Gansu, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, )Tj
T*(Xinjiang, and Tibet.[13] )Tj
T*( The tree prefers moist and loamy soils, but is adaptable to a very wide range )Tj
T*(of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of )Tj
T*(flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade.[3] In China it is often found )Tj
T*(in limestone-rich areas.[14] The tree of heaven is found within a wide range of )Tj
T*(climatic conditions.[3] In its native range it is found at high altitudes in )Tj
T*(Taiwan[16] as well as lower ones in mainland China.[4] In the U.S. it is found )Tj
T*(in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern )Tj
T*(Appalachians, and cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains. Prolonged cold and )Tj
T*(snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.[3] )Tj

T*( The earliest introductions of A. altissima to countries outside of its native )Tj
T*(range were to the southern areas of Korea as well as to Japan. It is possible )Tj
T*(that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the )Tj
T*(tree was a very early introduction.[19] Within China itself it has also been )Tj
T*(naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and )Tj
T*(Xinjiang.[14] )Tj
T*( In 1784, not long after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were forwarded )Tj
T*(to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia. In both )Tj
T*(Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a )Tj
T*(street tree, and by 1840 it was available in most nurseries.[4][10] The tree )Tj
T*(was separately brought to California in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who )Tj
T*(came during the California Gold Rush. It has escaped cultivation in all areas )Tj

T*(very soon invaded native ecosystems with disastrous results and became an )Tj
T*(invasive species.[21] Ailanthus has also been introduced to )Tj
T*(Argentina,[17]Australia \(where it is a declared weed in New South Wales and )Tj
T*(Victoria\),[24]New Zealand \(where it is listed under the National Pest Plant )Tj
T*(Accord and is classed an "unwanted organism"\),[25] the Middle East and in some )Tj
T*(countries in South Asia such as Pakistan.[26] )Tj
T*( In North America, A. altissima is present from Massachusetts in the east, west )Tj
T*(to southern Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and east to the north )Tj
T*(of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California )Tj
T*(and north to Washington.[3][17] In the east of its range it grows most )Tj
T*(extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a )Tj
T*(planted street tree.[4][17] It also grows along roads and railways. For )Tj
T*(example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on )Tj
T*(1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its )Tj
T*(range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year.[27] Similarly, another study )Tj
T*(conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is )Tj
T*(thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system )Tj
T*(length or mileage.[28] It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and )Tj
T*(competes with native plants.[17] In western North America it is most common in )Tj
T*(mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.[29][30] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology )Tj
T*( Ailanthus is an opportunistic plant that thrives in full sun and disturbed )Tj
T*(areas. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by root sprouts, )Tj
T*(re-sprouting rapidly after being cut.[3] It is considered a shade-intolerant )Tj
T*(tree and cannot compete in low-light situations,[31] though it is sometimes )Tj
T*(found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it was )Tj
T*(present at the time the stand was established.[3] On the other hand, a study in )Tj
T*(an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest in New York found that Ailanthus was )Tj
T*(capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 )Tj
T*(to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as )Tj
T*(using a "gap-obligate" strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it )Tj
T*(grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long )Tj
T*(period.[32] It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than )Tj
T*(50 years.[3] Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, )Tj
T*(including sulfur dioxide, which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand )Tj
T*(cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist ozone )Tj
T*(exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of mercury have been )Tj
T*(found built up in tissues of the plant.[17] )Tj
T*( Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has )Tj
T*(occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 )Tj
T*(\(approximately that of tomato juice\). It can withstand very low phosphorus )Tj
T*(levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong )Tj

T*(due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system.[17] It is )Tj
T*(frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also )Tj
T*(aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.[4] Along )Tj
T*(highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are )Tj
T*(present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.[17] )Tj
T*( Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits )Tj
T*(the growth of other plants.[33] The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and )Tj
T*(roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One )Tj
T*(study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of )Tj
T*(garden cress \(Lepidium sativum\) seeds from germinating. The same study tested )Tj
T*(the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed \(Amaranthus )Tj
T*(retroflexus\), velvetleaf \(Abutilon theophrastii\), yellow bristlegrass \(Setaria )Tj
T*(glauca\), barnyard grass \(Echinochloa crusgalli\), pea \(Pisum sativum cv. Sugar )Tj
T*(Snap\) and maize \(Zea mays cv. Silver Queen\). It proved able to kill nearly 100% )Tj
T*(of seedlings with the exception of velvetleaf, which showed some )Tj
T*(resistance.[34] Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was )Tj
T*(either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 )Tj
T*(conifers, with the white ash \(Fraxinus americana\) being the only plant not )Tj
T*(adversely affected.[35] The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of )Tj
T*(heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to )Tj
T*(prevent autotoxicity.[33] Resistance in various plant species has been shown to )Tj
T*(increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are )Tj
T*(most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been )Tj
T*(shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.[36] )Tj
T*( The tree of heaven is a very rapidly growing tree, possibly the fastest )Tj
T*(growing tree in North America.[37] Growth of one to two metres \(3.3 to 6.6Â ft\) )Tj
T*(per year for the first four years is considered normal. Shade considerably )Tj
T*(hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so )Tj
T*(faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than )Tj
T*(their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than )Tj
T*(Chinese ones.[37] )Tj
T*( In northern Europe the tree of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities )Tj
T*(until after the Second World War. This has been attributed to the tree's )Tj
T*(ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other )Tj
T*(plants would not grow.[18] In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities )Tj
T*(offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas. For example, )Tj
T*(one study in Germany found the tree of heaven growing in 92% of densely )Tj
T*(populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the )Tj
T*(city altogether.[18] In other areas of Europe this is not the case as climates )Tj
T*(are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in )Tj
T*(Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that )Tj
T*(country's Aggtelek National Park.[18] )Tj
T*( Several species of Lepidoptera utilise the leaves of ailanthus as food, )Tj
T*(including the Indian moon moth \(Actias selene\) and the common grass yellow )Tj
T*(\(Eurema hecabe\). In North America the tree is the host plant for the ailanthus )Tj
T*(webworm \(Atteva aurea\), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South )Tj
T*(America and originally used other members of the mostly tropical Simaroubaceae )Tj
T*(as its hosts.[38] In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least )Tj
T*(32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.[14] )Tj
T*( Due to the tree of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations )Tj
T*(often resort to various methods of control in order to keep its populations in )Tj
T*(check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an eradication program )Tj
T*(for the tree.[18] It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of )Tj
T*(eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A )Tj
T*(combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of )Tj
T*(course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most )Tj
T*(effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It )Tj
T*(involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill )Tj
T*(existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to )Tj
T*(prevent new growth.[39][note 1] )Tj

T*( In addition to its use as an ornamental plant, the tree of heaven is also used )Tj
T*(for its wood, medicinal properties, and as a host plant to feed silkworms of )Tj
T*(the moth Samia cynthia, which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than )Tj
T*(mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to )Tj
T*(take dye. This type of silk is known under various names: "pongee", "eri silk" )Tj
T*(and "Shantung silk", the last name being derived from Shandong Province in )Tj
T*(China where this silk is often produced. Its production is particularly well )Tj
T*(known in the Yantai region of that province. The moth has also been introduced )Tj
T*(in the United States.[4] )Tj
T*( The pale yellow, close-grained and satiny wood of ailanthus has been used in )Tj
T*(cabinet work.[40] It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen )Tj
T*(steamers, which are important in Chinese cuisine for cooking mantou, pastries )Tj
T*(and rice. Zhejiang Province in eastern China is most famous for producing these )Tj
T*(steamers.[4] It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its )Tj
T*(range as it moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available.[41] There are )Tj
T*(problems with using the wood as lumber, however. Because the trees exhibit )Tj
T*(rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the )Tj
T*(inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. )Tj
T*(Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this )Tj
T*(cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree )Tj
T*(tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly )Tj
T*(dried.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultivation )Tj
T*( Tree of heaven is a popular ornamental tree in China and valued for its )Tj
T*(tolerance of difficult growing conditions.[14] It was once very popular in )Tj
T*(cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, )Tj
T*(especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms )Tj
T*(and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by )Tj
T*(only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher )Tj
T*(seed production also results.[10]Michael Dirr, a noted American )Tj
T*(horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, )Tj
T*(in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes \(his )Tj
T*(emphasis\): )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(For most landscaping conditions, it has no value as there are too many trees of )Tj
T*(superior quality; for impossible conditions this tree has a place; selection )Tj
T*(could be made for good habit, strong wood and better foliage which would make )Tj
T*(the tree more satisfactory; I once talked with an architect who tried to buy )Tj
T*(Ailanthus for use along polluted highways but could not find an adequate supply )Tj
T*([...])Tj
T*(â€”Michael A. Dirr,Â  Manual of Woody Landscape Plants[43])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its )Tj
T*(habit is generally not as invasive as it is in America. In the United Kingdom )Tj
T*(it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is )Tj
T*(also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It )Tj
T*(becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It )Tj
T*(is also rare in Ireland.[44] In Germany the tree is commonly planted in )Tj
T*(gardens.[20] The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the )Tj
T*(west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making )Tj
T*(trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.[40] )Tj
T*( A few cultivars exist, but they are not often sold outside of China and )Tj
T*(probably not at all in North America: )Tj

T*( [edit] Medicinal )Tj
T*( Nearly every part of A. altissima has some application in Chinese traditional )Tj
T*(medicine. One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from 732 AD, is used )Tj
T*(for treating mental illness. It involved chopped root material, young boys' )Tj
T*(urine and douchi. After sitting for a day the liquid was strained out and given )Tj
T*(to the patient over the course of several days.[4] )Tj
T*( Another source from 684 AD, during the Tang dynasty and recorded in Li )Tj
T*(Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states that when the leaves are taken )Tj
T*(internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally )Tj
T*(they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another )Tj
T*(recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for )Tj
T*(young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and )Tj
T*(the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.[4] )Tj
T*( The dried bark, however, is still an officinal drug and is listed in the )Tj
T*(modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi \(Chinese: æ¤¿ç™½çš®; pinyin: )Tj
T*(chÅ«nbÃ¡ipÃ­\), meaning "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, )Tj
T*(discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its )Tj
T*(pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, )Tj
T*(stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which )Tj
T*(is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally )Tj
T*(cut into strips. The bark is said to have cooling and astringent properties and )Tj
T*(is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and )Tj
T*(spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10Â grams, so as )Tj
T*(not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the )Tj
T*(bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical )Tj
T*(use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and )Tj
T*(saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is )Tj
T*(a known antimalarial agent.[47] It is available in most shops dealing in )Tj
T*(Chinese traditional medicine.[4] A tincture of the root-bark has been used )Tj
T*(successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.[7] )Tj
T*( The samaras are also used in modern Chinese medicine under the name feng yan )Tj
T*(cao \(simplified Chinese: å‡¤çœ¼è‰; traditional Chinese: é³³çœ¼è‰; pinyin: )Tj
T*(fÃ¨ngyÇŽncÇŽo\), meaning "herbal phoenix eye". They are used as a hemostatic agent, )Tj
T*(spermatorrhea and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It )Tj
T*(was clinically shown to be able to treat trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection )Tj
T*(caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis.[4] In occident, an extract of )Tj
T*(the bark sold under the synonym A. glandulosa is sometimes used as an herbal )Tj
T*(remedy for various ailments including cancer.[48] )Tj
T*( Anecdotal evidence suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious )Tj
T*(odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact )Tj
T*(dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and )Tj
T*(paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well )Tj
T*(as active quassinoids \(ailanthone itself being one\) which may account for these )Tj
T*(effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in )Tj
T*(humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused )Tj

T*( [edit] Culture )Tj

T*(Tang dynasty in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and )Tj
T*(there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which )Tj
T*(character should be used. The current name, chouchun \(Chinese: è‡­æ¤¿; pinyin: )Tj

T*(tree". The name stems from the fact that A. altissima is one of the last trees )Tj
T*(to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming out would indicate that )Tj
T*(winter was truly over.[4] )Tj
T*( In Chinese literature, ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme )Tj
T*(metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled )Tj
T*(child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a )Tj
T*(friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write "wishing your )Tj
T*(ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically )Tj
T*(referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a )Tj
T*(child by calling him a "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the )Tj
T*(child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist )Tj
T*(philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the )Tj
T*(stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later )Tj
T*(scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to )Tj
T*(children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a )Tj
T*(worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.[50] )Tj
T*( [edit] United States )Tj
T*( The 1943 book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith uses the tree of heaven )Tj
T*(as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a )Tj
T*(difficult environment. At the time as well as now, ailanthus was common in )Tj
T*(neglected urban areas.[10][51] She writes: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call it the Tree of Heaven. )Tj
T*(No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree which struggles to reach the )Tj
T*(sky. It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows )Tj
T*(up out of cellar gratings. It is the only tree that grows out of cement. It )Tj
T*(grows lushly...survives without sun, water, and seemingly earth. It would be )Tj
T*(considered beautiful except that there are too many of it.)Tj
T*(â€”A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,Â Introduction)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed "tree from hell" due to its )Tj
T*(prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it.[51][52] In certain )Tj
T*(parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the "ghetto palm" )Tj
T*(because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban )Tj
T*(areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties.[53][54] )Tj
T*( Until March 26, 2008, a 60-foot \(18Â m\)-tall member of the species was a )Tj
T*(prominent "centerpiece" of the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in the )Tj
T*(borough of Queens in New York City. The tree had been spared by the sculptor )Tj
T*(Isamu Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum )Tj
T*(and cleaned up its back lot. The tree was the only one he left in the yard, and )Tj
T*(the staff would eat lunch with Noguchi under it. "[I]n a sense, the sculpture )Tj
T*(garden was designed around the tree", said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie )Tj
T*(Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By 2008, the old tree was found )Tj
T*(to be dying and in danger of crashing into the building, which was about to )Tj
T*(undergo a major renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven )Tj
T*(Woodshop, an artists' collective, to use the wood to create benches, sculptures )Tj
T*(and other amenities in and around the building. The tree's rings were counted, )Tj
T*(revealing its age to be 75, and museum officials hoped it would regenerate from )Tj
T*(a sucker.[55] )Tj
T*( [edit] Europe )Tj
T*( Ingo Vetter, a German artist and professor of fine arts at UmeÃ¥ University in )Tj
T*(Sweden, was influenced by the idea of the "ghetto palm" and installed a living )Tj
T*(ailanthus tree taken from Detroit for an international art show called )Tj

T*( Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! \(released internationally as They Say I'm a )Tj
T*(Monkey!\) is a 2008 Indonesian film directed by Djenar Maesa Ayu. Starring Titi )Tj
T*(Sjuman, Henidar Amroe, and Ray Sahetapi, it tells the life story of Adjeng, who )Tj
T*(was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18Â days )Tj
T*(after several years of development, the filmadapted two of Ayu's short stories )Tj
T*(from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing to its low budget of RpÂ 620 )Tj
T*(million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, although several )Tj
T*(established actors appeared at reduced rates. )Tj
T*( Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! has been described as "anti-Sjuman" because of the )Tj
T*(disparity between Ayu's more personal directing style and the social realism of )Tj
T*(her father, Sjumandjaja. Although commercially unsuccessful, the film was well )Tj
T*(received by critics. It won five national-level awards and was screened at )Tj
T*(several international film festivals. Two Indonesian publications, Tempo and )Tj
T*(The Jakarta Post, selected it as among the best films of 2008. )Tj
T*( Adjeng \(Titi Sjuman\) lives alone in an apartment paid for by her boyfriend, a )Tj
T*(rich businessman \(Joko Anwar\). A writer of children's stories, she wishes to )Tj
T*(write short stories for adults; in this, she is mentored by Asmoro \(Ray )Tj
T*(Sahetapy\)Â â€“ with whom she is also having sex. Meanwhile, Adjeng's mother )Tj
T*(\(Henidar Amroe\) handles various aspects of her life, constantly calling her and )Tj
T*(visiting without giving notice. This has led Adjeng's friends, Venny \(Ayu Dewi\) )Tj
T*(and Andien \(Fairuz Faisal\), to tease her about her overbearing mother. )Tj
T*( When Adjeng goes clubbing with her friends, she drinks too much and vomits, )Tj
T*(later passing out in a toilet. As she lies with her head on the seat she )Tj
T*(recalls that, as a child \(Nadya Romples\), she had been forced to eat vegetables )Tj
T*(she had previously vomited. Later, when Andien uses her apartment for a )Tj
T*(one-night stand, Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother )Tj
T*(having sex with her lover \(Bucek Depp\), a man who had previously molested )Tj
T*(AdjengÂ â€“ an act which is not shown explicitly. This background, as well as her )Tj
T*(recollections of life as a teenager \(played by Banyu Bening\) at the home of her )Tj
T*(womanising father \(August Melasz\) are worked into Adjeng's short story "Lintah" )Tj
T*(\("Leech"\). )Tj
T*( When Asmoro reads the story, he says that it is unrealistic and that readers )Tj
T*(need a climax. However, Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not )Tj
T*(all victims of rape are willing to call the police. Several days later, while )Tj
T*(they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that "Lintah" had been published in )Tj
T*(Kompas. Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's autobiographical nature, is )Tj
T*(furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's )Tj
T*(father abandoning them. )Tj
T*( Upset, Adjeng goes out with Venny and Andien, but when the two begin arguing )Tj
T*(about motherhood Adjeng leaves them both in the street. She then goes to a cafÃ© )Tj
T*(to drink with Asmoro, who comforts her. When she returns home she checks her )Tj
T*(messages, most of which are about the short story. Venny and Andien, meanwhile, )Tj
T*(return to their families and think of the importance of children. )Tj
T*( The following day, Asmoro sees the businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving )Tj
T*(her apartment, which puts him in a foul mood. He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro )Tj
T*(almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they are through. As )Tj
T*(Adjeng lays on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how )Tj
T*(her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her )Tj
T*(past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing. )Tj

T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( The film was originally meant to be based on the titular short story "Mereka )Tj
T*(Bilang, Saya Monyet!" from Djenar Maesa Ayu's 2002 debut, a critically and )Tj
T*(commercially successful short story anthology of the same name. However, Djenar )Tj
T*(later chose to base the film on "Lintah" \("Leech"\) and "Melukis Jendela" )Tj
T*(\("Painting the Window"\), two other stories from the anthology. Ayu had )Tj
T*(originally not intended to film her stories, but agreed after she was )Tj
T*(approached by a consortium who offered to fund her. She asked Indra Herlambang, )Tj
T*(a writer-cum-television personality, to help her write the screenplay as she )Tj
T*("never could write stories with a plot",[a] and she needed him to keep her )Tj
T*(motivated. The two wrote the screenplay over a period of two years, having )Tj
T*(difficulty finding new investors after the original ones dropped out. )Tj
T*( In 2004 Ayu began taking filmmaking classes to prepare herself to direct the )Tj
T*(film. She also watched several films directed by her father, the director )Tj
T*(Sjumandjaja, in preparation for production. Production began in October 2006, )Tj
T*(with some of the film crewÂ â€“ including art director Hardiyansah B. YasinÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(drawn in after Ayu met them at a cafe in South Jakarta and discovered that they )Tj
T*(were active in the local indie film scene. The group helped collect the Rp 620Â )Tj
T*(million \(US$ 75,000\) needed for production; as a cost-saving measure, numerous )Tj
T*(crew members were film students. )Tj
T*( Many of the roles were written with specific actors in mind, with casting for )Tj
T*(other roles promoted by word of mouth. Titi Sjuman, a lecturer at the Daya )Tj
T*(Kemang Institute of Art, was cast in the starring role of Adjeng after Ayu and )Tj
T*(her husband, Sri Aksana Sjuman \(Ayu's borther\), convinced her. At first she was )Tj
T*(uncomfortable with some of her scenes and her lack of training, as this was her )Tj
T*(first film role. However, she received support from her husband, who told her )Tj
T*(that she should act professionally and that "in a kissing sceneÂ ... [her] body )Tj
T*(should not reject it". The couple also provided the soundtrack for Mereka )Tj
T*(Bilang, Saya Monyet!, including three original songsÂ â€“ "When You Smile", )Tj
T*("Someday", and "Love, Sadness &amp; Happiness"Â â€“ performed by Sjuman. )Tj
T*( Model turned actress Henidar Amroe was chosen to play Adjeng's mother; Ayu )Tj
T*(later said that the role had been written with her in mind. Although worried )Tj
T*(about the sexual content of the film, Amroe accepted the role, calling it a )Tj
T*("crazy" plot that "read like a foreign movie". The young Adjeng was played by )Tj
T*(Ayu's daughter, Banyu Bening. Several of the established actors cast, including )Tj
T*(Jajang C. Noer, Ray Sahetapy, and August Melasz, agreed to appear in the film )Tj
T*(for less than their usual fee. Shooting took place over 18 days, although 14 )Tj
T*(had originally been allocated. )Tj
T*( [edit] Style and themes )Tj
T*( Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! deals with the after effects of child molestation )Tj
T*(in a way that the Indonesian magazine Tempo describes as an "interesting time )Tj
T*(control experiment",[b] replete with flashbacks which clearly establish the )Tj
T*(time frame in which scenes happen. According to Wicaksono Adi, in his review )Tj
T*(for Kompas, Adjeng's writing is her therapy, as it entails constant )Tj
T*(reconstruction and deconstruction of her troubled past; he posits that this )Tj
T*(ultimately allows Adjeng to fight back against the authority figures who had )Tj
T*(troubled her since she was young. In a making-of documentary on the film, Ayu )Tj
T*(said that she had no moral message or social criticism in mind when creating )Tj
T*(the film, considering it instead a form of self-exploration. Admitting that the )Tj
T*(film could be read as a critique of violence against women and children, she )Tj
T*(said that she could empathise as a woman. )Tj
T*( Adi also sees a loveâ€“hate relationship between Adjeng and her mother, which )Tj
T*(results in Adjeng's promiscuityÂ â€“ a common act in the Sastra Wangi literary )Tj
T*(movement of which Ayu is considered a part. The relationship between mother and )Tj
T*(daughter is reflective of themes in the earlier works Pasir Berbisik )Tj

T*(Riza. However, unlike the aforementioned films, Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! did )Tj
T*(not end with the daughter and mother on divergent paths. The reviewer Totot )Tj
T*(Indrarto, also writing for Kompas, wrote that Adjeng was the titular "monkey" )Tj
T*(of the film, being looked down upon by everyone around her; however, those who )Tj
T*(judge her do not actually know her, thus, in Indrarto's opinion, making them )Tj
T*(the "monkeys". )Tj
T*( A review in Tempo described the film as "anti-Sjuman" owing to the differences )Tj
T*(in styles between father and daughter. Sjuman's films tended to fall under )Tj
T*(social realism, while Ayu's debut had more of a personal, symbolic aspect with )Tj
T*(a touch of surrealism. The film does not show Adjeng's molestation, instead )Tj
T*(symbolizing it by showing a leech feeding; in one case, when Adjeng is raped in )Tj
T*(a bathtub, losing her virginity, the scene is represented by blood-red water )Tj
T*(and numerous leeches feeding. )Tj
T*( [edit] Release and reception )Tj
T*( Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! received a wide release on 3 January 2008. )Tj
T*(Commercially unsuccessful in the country, the film was screened at several )Tj
T*(international film festivals, including the 2008 Singapore International Film )Tj
T*(Festival \(SIFF\), the 2008 Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in Estonia, and )Tj
T*(the 2009 Asian Hot Shot Film Festival in Berlin. The film was released on DVD )Tj
T*(in Indonesia on 9 May 2008 by Jive! Collection, after passing through the )Tj
T*(censorship board in March. The DVD featured English-language subtitles, )Tj
T*(English- and Indonesian-language editions of the source short stories, and a )Tj
T*(behind-the-scenes documentary. )Tj
T*( The film received generally positive reviews. Seno Joko Suyono, in a review )Tj
T*(for Tempo, stated that the cliched plot of family crisis became more )Tj
T*(interesting with the introduction of sex; he also called the climax "sweet yet )Tj
T*(disturbing".[c] Later in 2008 the magazine selected Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! )Tj
T*(as the best local movie of 2008, writing that Ayu had taken to directing like )Tj
T*("a fish that had long floundered on the dry ground and was finally returned to )Tj
T*(the sea."[d] Iskandar Liem, writing for The Jakarta Post, also listed the film )Tj

T*(married three times and is the father of five children. )Tj
T*( Childhood )Tj
T*( McCartney was born on 18 June 1942, in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, )Tj
T*(where his mother, Mary \(nÃ©e Mohin\), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His )Tj
T*(father, James \("Jim"\) McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his )Tj
T*(work as a volunteer firefighter during World WarÂ II. Paul has one younger )Tj
T*(brother, Michael \(born 7 January 1944\). Though the children were baptised in )Tj
T*(their mother's Roman Catholic faith, their father, a former Protestant turned )Tj
T*(agnostic, felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for )Tj
T*(the sake of their religious teachings, so he and Mary did not emphasise )Tj
T*(religion in the household.[3] )Tj
T*( McCartney had attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, )Tj
T*(when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at )Tj
T*(Stockton.[4] In 1953, he passed the 11-plus exam, with only three others out of )Tj
T*(ninety examinees, gaining admission to the Liverpool Institute.[5] In 1954, he )Tj
T*(met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus to the Institute from his suburban )Tj
T*(home in Speke. Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a )Tj
T*(grammar school rather than a secondary modern school, where most pupils went )Tj
T*(until becoming eligible to work. The two quickly became friends; McCartney )Tj
T*(later admitted: "I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year )Tj
T*(younger."[6] )Tj
T*( As the family's primary wage earner, Mary's income as a midwife had enabled )Tj
T*(them to move into 20Â Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964.[7] )Tj
T*(She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her )Tj
T*(leaving at "about three in the morning [the] streetsÂ ... thick with snow". On )Tj
T*(31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an )Tj
T*(embolism.[9] McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with John )Tj
T*(Lennon, whose mother, Julia, had died when he was seventeen. )Tj
T*( A trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s, )Tj
T*(McCartney's father kept an upright piano in the front room, and he encouraged )Tj
T*(his sons to be musical.[nb 1] Jim gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his )Tj
T*(fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, )Tj
T*(Paul traded it for a Â£15 Framus Zenith \(modelÂ 17\) acoustic guitar, )Tj
T*(rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.[14] )Tj
T*(He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster )Tj
T*(advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman also played )Tj
T*(left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first )Tj
T*(song, "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune )Tj
T*(that would become "When I'm Sixty-Four" on the piano. Against his father's )Tj
T*(advice, he took few piano lessons, preferring to learn by ear. Heavily )Tj
T*(influenced by American rhythm and blues music, Little Richard was his schoolboy )Tj
T*(idol. "Long Tall Sally" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a )Tj

T*(a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. )Tj
T*(Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school )Tj
T*(friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960. By May 1960, the band had tried )Tj
T*(several names, including Beatals, Johnny and the Moondogs and the Silver )Tj
T*(Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer )Tj
T*(Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg. )Tj
T*( 1960â€“1970: the Beatles )Tj
T*( Main article: The Beatles )Tj
T*( Informally represented by Allan Williams, the Beatles' first booking was for a )Tj
T*(series of performances in Hamburg, starting in 1960.[23][nb 2] In 1961, )Tj
T*(Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player.[25] )Tj
T*(They recorded professionally for the first time while in Hamburg, credited as )Tj
T*(the Beat Brothers, as the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the )Tj
T*(single "My Bonnie". This brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein, a key )Tj
T*(figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in )Tj
T*(January 1962.Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first )Tj
T*(hit, "Love Me Do", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the )Tj
T*(US a year later. Their fans' hysteria became known as "Beatlemania", and the )Tj
T*(press sometimes referred to McCartney as the "cute Beatle".[28][nb 3][nb 4] )Tj
T*( In 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "Yesterday", featuring )Tj
T*(a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, the song was the group's first )Tj
T*(recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that )Tj
T*(involved only a single band member.[31] "Yesterday" became the most covered )Tj
T*(song in popular music history.[32] Later that year, during recording sessions )Tj
T*(for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant )Tj
T*(musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, "from [1965]Â ... )Tj
T*([McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as )Tj
T*(instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director". Critics )Tj
T*(described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity )Tj
T*(of the band's music and lyrics.[34] Considered a high point in the Beatles )Tj
T*(catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney claimed lead authorship for the song, "In )Tj
T*(My Life".[35] McCartney said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now )Tj
T*(it was time to expand." Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber )Tj
T*(Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: )Tj
T*("the clash between John and Paul was becoming obviousÂ ... [and] as far as Paul )Tj
T*(was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no rightâ€”Paul was absolutely )Tj
T*(finicky." )Tj
T*( In 1966, the Beatles released the album Revolver. Featuring sophisticated )Tj
T*(lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres )Tj
T*(ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock, the album )Tj
T*(marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The first of three consecutive )Tj
T*(McCartney A-sides, the single "Paperback Writer" preceded the LP's release.[39] )Tj
T*(The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its )Tj
T*(B-side, "Rain". The films, described by Harrison as "the forerunner of videos", )Tj
T*(aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966.[40]Revolver )Tj
T*(also included McCartney's "Eleanor Rigby", which featured a string octet. )Tj
T*(According to Gould, the song is "a neoclassical tour de force ... a true )Tj
T*(hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song".[41] With the )Tj
T*(exception of some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal )Tj
T*(and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.[nb 5] )Tj
T*( The band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour. )Tj
T*(Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project apart from the )Tj
T*(groupâ€”a film score for the UK production The Family Way. The score was a )Tj
T*(collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen )Tj

T*(regarded as rock's first concept album.[47] Inspired to create a new persona )Tj
T*(for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to )Tj
T*(their fans that they had musically matured, McCartney invented the fictional )Tj
T*(band of the album's title track.[48] As McCartney explained, "We were fed up )Tj
T*(with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top )Tj
T*(approach. We were not boys we were menÂ ... and [we] thought of ourselves as )Tj
T*(artists rather than just performers." )Tj
T*( Starting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during )Tj
T*(recording sessions for the album. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, "the )Tj
T*(Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonicallyÂ ... we )Tj
T*(were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniquesÂ ... )Tj
T*(limiters andÂ ... effects like flanging and ADT."[51] Their recording of "A Day )Tj
T*(in the Life" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took )Tj
T*(turns conducting.[52] The sessions produced the double A-side single )Tj
T*("Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" in February 1967, and the LP followed )Tj
T*(in June.[nb 6] McCartney's "She's Leaving Home" was an orchestral pop song. )Tj
T*(MacDonald described the track as "[among] the finest work on Sgt. PepperÂ â€” )Tj
T*(imperishable popular art of its time." Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, )Tj
T*(the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann )Tj
T*(Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts )Tj
T*(Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities.[55][nb 7] The Beatles' heavy )Tj
T*(moustaches reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, )Tj
T*(while their clothing "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", )Tj
T*(wrote Gould.[57] Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as "the most )Tj
T*(important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded". )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( "After Brian diedÂ ... Paul took over and supposedly led us you knowÂ ... we )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( â€”John Lennon, Rolling Stone magazine, 1970 )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Epstein's death in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles )Tj
T*(perplexed and concerned about their future. McCartney, stepping in to fill that )Tj
T*(void, gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of the group )Tj
T*(Lennon had once led. His first creative suggestion after this change of )Tj
T*(leadership was to propose that the band move forward on their plans to produce )Tj
T*(a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour. The project )Tj
T*(was "an administrative nightmare throughout", according to Beatles' historian )Tj
T*(Mark Lewisohn. McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group )Tj
T*(their first unfavourable critical response. However, the film's soundtrack was )Tj
T*(more successful. Released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc )Tj
T*(\(EP\), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five of the )Tj
T*(band's recent singles. The only Capitol compilation later included in the )Tj
T*(group's official canon of studio albums, the Magical Mystery Tour LP achieved )Tj
T*($8Â million in sales within three weeks of the release, higher initial sales )Tj
T*(than any other Capitol LP up to that point. )Tj
T*( In January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for a promotional trailer intended to )Tj
T*(advertise the animated film Yellow Submarine, loosely based on the imaginary )Tj
T*(world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition. Though critics admired the film )Tj
T*(for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven )Tj
T*(months later received a less enthusiastic response.[65] By late 1968, relations )Tj
T*(within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew while recording The )Tj

T*( â€”McCartney, Guitar Player, July 1990 )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( McCartney played lead electric guitar on several Beatles recordings, including )Tj
T*(what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "Drive My )Tj
T*(Car", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the )Tj
T*(instrument, "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."[218] He )Tj
T*(contributed what MacDonald described as "a startling guitar solo" on the )Tj
T*(Harrison composition "Taxman" and the "shrieking" guitar on "Sgt. Pepper's )Tj
T*(Lonely Hearts Club Band" and "Helter Skelter". MacDonald also praised )Tj
T*(McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian" guitar solo on "Good Morning Good )Tj
T*(Morning".[219] McCartney also played lead guitar on "Another Girl". On his )Tj
T*("Taxman" solo, McCartney commented, "I was very inspired by Jimi Hendrix. It )Tj
T*(was really my first voyage into feedback." In 1990, when asked who his )Tj
T*(favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and )Tj
T*(David Gilmour, stating, "but I still like Hendrix the best." He has primarily )Tj
T*(used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live )Tj
T*(performances. )Tj
T*( Vocals )Tj
T*( McCartney's vocals cross several musical genres. On "Call Me Back Again", )Tj
T*(according to Benitez, "McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist" while )Tj
T*(MacDonald called "I'm Down" "a rock-and-roll classic" that "illustrates )Tj
T*(McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility".[221] MacDonald described "Helter )Tj
T*(Skelter" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and "Hey Jude" as a "pop/rock )Tj
T*(hybrid", pointing out McCartney's "use of gospel-style melismas" in the song )Tj
T*(and his "pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out".[222] Benitez identified "Hope )Tj
T*(of Deliverance" and "Put It There" as examples of McCartney's folk music )Tj
T*(efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered "When I'm Sixty-Four" and )Tj
T*("Honey Pie" attempts at vaudeville.[223] MacDonald praised the "swinging beat" )Tj
T*(of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, "She's a Woman" as "the most )Tj
T*(extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice "at the )Tj
T*(edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to )Tj
T*(crack at any moment." MacDonald described "I've Got a Feeling" as a "raunchy, )Tj
T*(mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" vocal performance and "Back in )Tj
T*(the U.S.S.R." as "the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's )Tj
T*("belting" vocals among his best since "Drive My Car", recorded three years )Tj
T*(earlier.[225] )Tj
T*( Keyboards )Tj
T*( McCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including "Every Little )Tj
T*(Thing", "She's a Woman", "For No One", "A Day in the Life", "Hello, Goodbye", )Tj
T*("Hey Jude", "Lady Madonna", "Let It Be" and "The Long and Winding Road".[226] )Tj
T*(MacDonald considered the piano part in "Lady Madonna" as reminiscent of Fats )Tj
T*(Domino, and "Let It Be" as having a gospel rhythm.[227] MacDonald called )Tj
T*(McCartney's Mellotron intro on "Strawberry Fields Forever" an integral feature )Tj
T*(of the song's character. McCartney played a Moog synthesizer on the Beatles )Tj
T*(song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and the Wings track "Loup \(1st Indian on the )Tj
T*(Moon\)".[229] Ingham described the Wings songs "With a Little Luck" and "London )Tj
T*(Town" as "full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches".[230] )Tj
T*( Drums )Tj
T*( McCartney played drums on the Beatles songs "Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Dear )Tj
T*(Prudence", "Martha My Dear", "Wild Honey Pie" and "The Ballad of John and )Tj
T*(Yoko".[231] He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo )Tj
T*(albums McCartney and McCartney II, as well as on the Wings album Band on the )Tj
T*(Run and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the )Tj
T*(Backyard.[232] )Tj
T*( Tape loops )Tj
T*( In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, )Tj
T*(McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home. )Tj
T*(They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by )Tj

T*( Early influences )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( â€”McCartney on Presley, The Beatles Anthology, 2000 )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( McCartney's earliest musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, )Tj
T*(Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry.[237] When asked why the Beatles did )Tj
T*(not include Presley on the Sgt. Pepper cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too )Tj
T*(important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him )Tj
T*(on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the )Tj
T*(King." McCartney stated that for his bassline for "I Saw Her Standing There", )Tj
T*(he directly quoted Berry's "I'm Talking About You".[239] )Tj
T*( McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalizations inspired )Tj
T*(McCartney's own vocal technique. McCartney said he wrote "I'm Down" as a )Tj
T*(vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.[241] In 1971, McCartney bought )Tj
T*(the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth )Tj
T*(anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly )Tj
T*(Week" in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous )Tj
T*(musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events )Tj
T*(featuring performances by the Crickets.[242] )Tj
T*( Lifestyle )Tj
T*( Creative outlets )Tj
T*( While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often )Tj
T*(earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline )Tj
T*(negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission )Tj
T*(to art college. During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored )Tj
T*(experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical )Tj
T*(music performances. His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was )Tj
T*(through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert )Tj
T*(Fraser. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy )Tj
T*(Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later )Tj
T*(purchased works by Magritte, using his painting of an apple for the Apple )Tj
T*(Records logo. McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of )Tj
T*(the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded )Tj
T*(and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also co-founded International Times, )Tj
T*(an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial )Tj
T*(support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later )Tj
T*(wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years From Now \(1997\).[247] )Tj
T*( McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de )Tj
T*(Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in )Tj
T*(1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The )Tj
T*(70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. )Tj
T*(Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose )Tj
T*(the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest )Tj
T*(in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's )Tj
T*(paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, )Tj
T*(England.[251] In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of )Tj
T*(Liverpool. McCartney said, "I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at )Tj
T*(the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant )Tj
T*(afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for )Tj
T*(15 years but now I'm out of the closet".[252] McCartney is lead patron of the )Tj
T*(Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly )Tj
T*(occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys. )Tj
T*( When McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to )Tj

T*(2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to )Tj

T*(the foreword of the book, he explains: "When I was a teenagerÂ ... I had an )Tj

T*(something deep and meaningfulâ€”which was promptly rejectedâ€”and I suppose I have )Tj
T*(been trying to get my own back ever since". In 2005, he released High in the )Tj

T*(Tropic Island Hum. The accompanying single, "Tropic Island Hum"/"We All Stand )Tj

T*(significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, )Tj
T*(including the publishing rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, )Tj

T*( McCartney's music has appeared on several record labels. In January 1962, )Tj
T*(Polydor Records issued the first commercially released recording of the )Tj

T*( In 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of )Tj

T*(McCartney and Yoko Ono attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in )Tj

T*(businessman Robert Holmes Ã  Court. Michael Jackson subsequently purchased ATV )Tj

T*(Â£59,052,000 \($95Â million\), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he )Tj
T*(retained half-ownership.[273] McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and )Tj
T*(handling of Northern Songs over the years. Now formally dissolved, in 1995 it )Tj
T*(became absorbed in the Sony/ATV catalogue.[274] McCartney receives writers' )Tj
T*(royalties which together are 33â…“ percent of total commercial proceeds in the )Tj
T*(US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent. Two of the Beatles' )Tj
T*(earliest songsâ€”"Love Me Do" and "P.S. I Love You"â€”were published by an EMI )Tj

T*(acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are )Tj
T*(the only two Beatles songs owned by MPL Communications.[276] )Tj
T*( Drugs )Tj
T*( McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used )Tj
T*(Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods.Bob Dylan )Tj
T*(introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney )Tj
T*(recalls getting "very high" and "giggling uncontrollably". His use of the drug )Tj
T*(soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics )Tj
T*("another kind of mind" in "Got to Get You into My Life" specifically as a )Tj
T*(reference to cannabis.[279] During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally )Tj
T*(smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often )Tj
T*(forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive )Tj
T*(women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to )Tj
T*(cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the )Tj
T*(recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total )Tj
T*(but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt )Tj
T*(afterwards.[281] )Tj
T*( Initially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and )Tj
T*(took his second "acid trip" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper )Tj
T*(studio session.[282] He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug )Tj
T*(publicly, declaring, "It opened my eyes... [and] made me a better, more honest, )Tj
T*(more tolerant member of society." He made his attitude about cannabis public in )Tj
T*(1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a )Tj
T*(July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release )Tj
T*(of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. )Tj
T*( In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney Â£1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon )Tj
T*(after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to )Tj
T*(his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a Â£100 fine. As a result of his )Tj
T*(drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December )Tj
T*(1973.[285] Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, )Tj

T*(at the Casbah club in 1959. According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a )Tj
T*(compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and make-up for her, )Tj
T*(encouraging her to grow her hair out like Brigitte Bardot's, and at least once )Tj
T*(insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect.[313] When McCartney )Tj
T*(first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she )Tj
T*(accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The )Tj
T*(couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until )Tj
T*(Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now "free of obligation", )Tj
T*(ended the engagement. )Tj
T*( Jane Asher )Tj
T*( McCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when a )Tj
T*(photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert )Tj
T*(Hall in London. The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he )Tj
T*(took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London. )Tj
T*(They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to )Tj
T*(McCartney's own home in St. John's Wood, in March 1966.[318] He wrote several )Tj
T*(songs while living at the Ashers', including "Yesterday", "And I Love Her", )Tj
T*("You Won't See Me" and "I'm Looking Through You", the latter three having been )Tj
T*(inspired by their romance. They had a five-year relationship and planned to )Tj
T*(marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become )Tj
T*(involved with Francie Schwartz.[320] )Tj
T*( Wives )Tj
T*( Linda Eastman )Tj
T*( Linda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were )Tj
T*(spent with an ear to the radio." At times, she skipped school to see artists )Tj
T*(such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular photographer )Tj
T*(with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful )Tj
T*(Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. )Tj
T*(She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle )Tj
T*(hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I )Tj
T*(liked." The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The )Tj
T*(Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in )Tj
T*(London. As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a )Tj
T*(crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, )Tj
T*(I realised I had toÂ ... Pushiness worked for me that night!"[323] Linda said )Tj
T*(this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody )Tj
T*(else [that night]Â ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked )Tj
T*(so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." The pair )Tj
T*(married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun )Tj
T*(togetherÂ ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to )Tj
T*(just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." He )Tj
T*(added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, )Tj
T*(and it was nearly called offÂ ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we )Tj
T*(did." )Tj
T*( The two collaborated musically after the Beatles' break-up, forming Wings in )Tj
T*(1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her )Tj
T*(inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, "she )Tj
T*(conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." Paul defended her )Tj
T*(musical ability: "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboardÂ ... She took a )Tj
T*(couple lessons and learned some bluesy thingsÂ ... she did very well and made it )Tj
T*(look easier than it wasÂ ... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' )Tj
T*(or 'Look at herâ€”she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is )Tj
T*(that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be )Tj

T*( They had four childrenâ€”Linda's daughter Heather \(legally adopted by Paul\), )Tj
T*(Mary, Stella and Jamesâ€”and remained married until Linda's death from breast )Tj
T*(cancer in 1998. After her death, Paul stated in The Daily Mail, "I got a )Tj

T*( Heather Mills )Tj
T*( In 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills, a former model and anti-landmines )Tj
T*(campaigner. In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, named in honour of )Tj
T*(Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts. They separated in April 2006 )Tj
T*(and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008.[332] In 2004, he commented on media )Tj

T*( Nancy Shevell )Tj
T*( McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Old )Tj
T*(Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The wedding was a modest event )Tj
T*(attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends.[189] The couple had been )Tj

T*(apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told )Tj
T*(him, "You're all pizza and fairytales!" In an effort to avoid talking only )Tj
T*(about business, they often spoke of cats, babies or baking bread. )Tj
T*( On 24 April 1976, the two were watching an episode of Saturday Night Live )Tj
T*(together at Lennon's home in New York City, during which Lorne Michaels made a )Tj

T*(studio surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction, he responded: )Tj
T*("It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a )Tj
T*(superficial response. He later explained, "When John was killed somebody stuck )Tj
T*(a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a )Tj
T*(dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you )Tj
T*(put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment )Tj
T*(on his dead friend said, "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to )Tj
T*(make." He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last )Tj
T*(conversation with Lennon: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, )Tj
T*("John was really fond of you." The last telephone conversation I had with him )Tj
T*(we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff )Tj
T*(was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, )Tj
T*(and say, "it's only me." They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are )Tj
T*(the moments I treasure.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In 1983, McCartney said, "I would not have been as typically human and )Tj
T*(standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of )Tj
T*(an effort to try and get behind his "mask" and have a better relationship with )Tj
T*(him." He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with )Tj
T*(his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he admitted the ex-Beatles )Tj
T*(were nervous at the time that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo )Tj
T*(magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang )Tj
T*(backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, "All Those Years Ago", which )Tj
T*(featured Starr on drums. McCartney released "Here Today" in 1982, a song )Tj
T*(Everett described as "a haunting tribute" to McCartney's friendship with )Tj
T*(Lennon. )Tj
T*( George Harrison )Tj
T*( Discussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said, "Paul would always )Tj
T*(help along when you'd done his ten songsâ€”then when he got 'round to doing one )Tj
T*(of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actuallyÂ ... )Tj
T*(There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bassÂ ... because what Paul )Tj

T*(come in the studio and say \(sometimes he was very difficult\): "Do this". He'd )Tj
T*(never give you the opportunity to come out with something."[351] )Tj
T*( After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney issued a statement outside )Tj
T*(his home in St. John's Wood, calling him "a lovely guy and a very brave man who )Tj
T*(had a wonderful sense of humour". He went on to say, "We grew up together and )Tj
T*(we just had so many beautiful times togetherÂ â€“ that's what I am going to )Tj
T*(remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother."[352] On the first )Tj
T*(anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's "Something" on a ukulele )Tj
T*(at the Concert for George. He also performed "For You Blue" and "All Things )Tj
T*(Must Pass", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of "While My )Tj
T*(Guitar Gently Weeps". )Tj
T*( Ringo Starr )Tj
T*( Starr once described McCartney as "pleasantly insincere", though the two )Tj
T*(generally enjoy each other's company, and at least once went on holiday )Tj
T*(together in Greece. Starr recalled, "We couldn't understand a word of the songs )Tj
T*(the hotel band were playing, so on the last night Paul and I did a few rockers )Tj
T*(like "What'd I Say". There was at times discord between them as well, )Tj
T*(particularly during sessions for the White Album. As Apple's Peter Brown )Tj
T*(recalled, "it was a poorly kept secret among Beatle intimates that after Ringo )Tj
T*(left the studio Paul would often dub in the drum tracks himselfÂ ... [Starr] )Tj
T*(would pretend not to notice". In August 1968, the two got into an argument over )Tj
T*(McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for "Back in the U.S.S.R.", which )Tj
T*(contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.[357] When Starr returned in )Tj

T*(Alesi was forced to serve a 10-second stop-and-go penalty because his car moved )Tj
T*(forward before the start. Alesi climbed back up to second, before retiring on )Tj
T*(lapÂ 25. Schumacher's rival in the Drivers' Championship, Damon Hill, started )Tj
T*(fourth amidst pressure from the British media after poor performances at )Tj
T*(previous races. Hill moved up to second because of Alesi's retirement, but spun )Tj
T*(off the circuit on lapÂ 40.[3] )Tj
T*( Schumacher's win was his ninth of the season, matching Nigel Mansell's record )Tj
T*(for victories in a season that was set in 1992.[4] Benetton were confirmed )Tj
T*(Constructors' Champions as Williams could not pass Benetton's points total in )Tj
T*(the one remaining race.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Report )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( Heading into the penultimate race of the season, Benetton driver Michael )Tj
T*(Schumacher had already won the season's Drivers' Championship, having clinched )Tj
T*(the title at the previous race, the Pacific Grand Prix. Schumacher led the )Tj
T*(championship with 92Â points; Damon Hill was second with 59Â points. A maximum of )Tj
T*(20Â points were available for the remaining two races, which meant that Hill )Tj
T*(could not catch Schumacher. Although the Drivers' Championship was decided, the )Tj
T*(Constructors' Championship was not. Benetton were leading on 123Â points and )Tj
T*(Williams were second with 102Â points heading into the 16thÂ race, with a maximum )Tj
T*(of 32Â points available.[5] In the week leading up to the race, Hill was )Tj
T*(criticised by the British media after poor performances in previous races; )Tj
T*(there was continued speculation that Williams were going to replace him with )Tj
T*(Heinz-Harald Frentzen or Gerhard Berger for the 1996 season.[6][7][8] Despite )Tj
T*(the rumours, Williams team boss Frank Williams gave Hill "an unequivocal vote )Tj
T*(of confidence" heading into the race.[9] )Tj
T*( There were two driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the )Tj
T*(two Sauber cars since the fifthÂ race of the season at Monaco, Jean-Christophe )Tj
T*(Boullion was released from the team and replaced by Karl Wendlinger. The )Tj
T*(Austrian was given another chance to prove himself after suffering an accident )Tj
T*(at the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix, which left him in a coma for weeks.[10] The )Tj
T*(second driver change was Mika HÃ¤kkinen's return to McLaren after missing the )Tj
T*(Pacific Grand Prix because of an operation for appendicitis.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Practice and qualifying )Tj
T*( Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday )Tj
T*(morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1Â hour and 45Â )Tj
T*(minutes with weather conditions dry throughout.[12] Schumacher was fastest in )Tj
T*(the first session, posting a time of 1:40.410, two-tenths of a second quicker )Tj
T*(than HÃ¤kkinen. The Williams and Ferrari cars occupied the remaining top six )Tj
T*(positions; Williams drivers Hill and David Coulthard third and fifth )Tj
T*(respectively. The Ferraris were fourth and sixth fastest; Jean Alesi ahead of )Tj
T*(Berger. HÃ¤kkinen lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session )Tj
T*(with a time of 1:40.389. Eddie Irvine took second place in the Jordan car, )Tj
T*(three-tenths of a second behind HÃ¤kkinen. Hill was third in the Williams, )Tj
T*(two-tenths behind HÃ¤kkinen, with Schumacher fourth behind Hill. The Ferraris )Tj
T*(were fifth and eighth; Alesi in front of Berger. Frentzen's Sauber and )Tj
T*(Coulthard's Williams split the Ferraris.[1] Despite both the Williams cars )Tj
T*(going off into the gravel, Hill and Coulthard made the topÂ 10.[13] )Tj

T*( "Nobody is more disappointed than myself and the team. We have to investigate )Tj

T*(held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The )Tj
T*(fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid )Tj
T*(position.[12] Schumacher clinched his tenth career pole position, in his )Tj
T*(Benetton B195, with a time of 1:38.023. He was joined on the front row by )Tj
T*(Alesi, who was eight-tenths of a second behind.[1][15] Schumacher was )Tj
T*(particularly pleased with the performance of his Benetton, saying that "I have )Tj
T*(rarely had such a good car [...] I think I can be confident for the race".[16] )Tj
T*(Alesi was satisfied about his performance, but worried about a mechanical )Tj
T*(problem which had caused him to crash on Friday, accusing the Ferrari team of )Tj
T*(withholding information from him.[16] Alesi was scheduled to leave Ferrari for )Tj
T*(Benetton in a swap with Schumacher at the end of the season, and the )Tj
T*(relationship between him and the team was becoming increasingly strained.[17] )Tj
T*(HÃ¤kkinen was third in the McLaren, with Hill fourth, a second slower than )Tj
T*(Schumacher. Despite HÃ¤kkinen's best qualifying effort of the season alongside )Tj
T*(his Belgium third place,[18] his team-mate, Mark Blundell, had a disappointing )Tj
T*(qualifying session. In the first part of qualifying, Blundell crashed into the )Tj
T*(wall, meaning he could not set a time as his car was too badly damaged. )Tj
T*(Blundell had his second crash of the weekend at the 130RÂ corner in Saturday )Tj
T*(practice, which was more serious than the first. Following medical advice, )Tj
T*(Blundell did not participate in the second qualifying session. He was unable to )Tj
T*(set a time, leaving him at the back of the grid.[19]Aguri Suzuki crashed his )Tj
T*(Ligier during Saturday qualifying; he was unable to start the race since he was )Tj
T*(in a hospital with a broken rib.[3] )Tj
T*( The track surface was damp for most of the race, which meant that lap times )Tj
T*(were slower than the previous days' qualifying sessions.[1] The drivers took to )Tj
T*(the track at 09:30Â JST \(GMT +10\) for a 30-minute warmup session. Despite )Tj
T*(underperforming in qualifying, both Williams cars performed better in the wet )Tj
T*(weather warmup session; Hill had the fastest time of 2:00.025. Coulthard was )Tj
T*(third in the other Williams car; Schumacher split them in second position. )Tj
T*(Alesi completed the top four, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill.[1] Though )Tj
T*(24Â cars qualified for the race, only 22 took the start: Suzuki was unable to )Tj
T*(start because of his crash in qualifying and Roberto Moreno's Forti car )Tj
T*(suffered a gearbox problem.[9][20] For the first time since the Japanese Grand )Tj
T*(Prix was held at Suzuka in 1987, tickets for the race did not sell out, despite )Tj
T*(the fact that three Japanese drivers entered the race.[21] )Tj
T*( The race started at 14:00Â JST. All of the drivers opted to start on wet )Tj
T*(weather tyres as the track was damp from the morning rain.[3] Schumacher, from )Tj
T*(pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Alesi, who )Tj
T*(started alongside Schumacher, was judged to have jumped the start, and served a )Tj
T*(10-second stop-and-go penalty on lapÂ three,[3][15] from which he returned to )Tj
T*(the race in tenth place.[1] Alesi's team-mate Berger also jumped the start and )Tj
T*(received the same penalty. Gianni Morbidelli, near the back of the field in one )Tj
T*(of the Footwork cars, spun at the first corner on lapÂ one after being hit from )Tj
T*(behind by Wendlinger's Sauber. Morbidelli stalled his car in the process, )Tj
T*(forcing him to retire from the race.[9] On lapÂ seven, Alesi stopped at the pits )Tj
T*(to change to dry weather slick tyres, as the track was beginning to )Tj
T*(dry.[15][22] On returning to the race, he began to make his way through the )Tj
T*(field constantly recording fastest laps; the first of which was 1:54.416, fiveÂ )Tj
T*(seconds faster than the remainder of the field.[22][23] Schumacher made a pit )Tj
T*(stop on lapÂ 10 for slicks, handing the lead to HÃ¤kkinen for a lap before he too )Tj
T*(pitted. Alesi's progress was interrupted when he spun attempting to pass Pedro )Tj
T*(Lamy's Minardi for 15thÂ place,[3][15] but he made his way up to second by lapÂ )Tj
T*(10, overtaking Hill around the outside in the final chicane to take the place. )Tj
T*(Alerted by Alesi's pace on the slick tyres, the other drivers came into the )Tj
T*(pits to change to slick tyres.[24] )Tj
T*( The two Jordan cars collided on lapÂ 15. Rubens Barrichello spun in the final )Tj
T*(chicane when he attempted to brake later than his team-mate Irvine. Barrichello )Tj
T*(hit a wall, which damaged his car's rear wing and caused him to retire from the )Tj
T*(race. Irvine was involved in another collision at the chicane on lapÂ 20 when )Tj
T*(Frentzen hit him from behind. Irvine continued without damage, but Frentzen had )Tj

T*(with remains of C.Â ferox, but there is no evidence that the two lived at the )Tj
T*(same time. Living species of comparably-sized, related carnivores in other )Tj
T*(regions manage to coexist, suggesting that the same may have happened with both )Tj
T*(C.Â spelea and C.Â ferox. C.Â spelea would have been able to prey on larger )Tj
T*(animals than its smaller relative could have, including the recently extinct )Tj
T*(giant lemurs. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier described subfossil carnivoran remains from two )Tj
T*(caves on Madagascar as a larger "variety" of the living fossa \(Cryptoprocta )Tj
T*(ferox\), C. ferox var. spelea. G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered spelea to )Tj
T*(represent a distinct species.[3]Charles Lamberton reviewed subfossil and living )Tj
T*(Cryptoprocta in 1939 and agreed with Petit in recognizing two species,[5] )Tj
T*(naming this species from a specimen found at Ankazoabo Cave near Itampolo. The )Tj
T*(specific name spelea means "cave" and was given because of the location of its )Tj
T*(discovery.[6] However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the )Tj
T*(living fossa, not nearly enough to capture the range of variation in that )Tj
T*(species, and some later authors did not separate C.Â spelea and C.Â ferox as )Tj
T*(species.[7]Steven Goodman and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled )Tj
T*(another set of Cryptoprocta measurements that was published in a 2004 article. )Tj
T*(They found that some subfossil Cryptoprocta fell outside the range of variation )Tj
T*(of living C.Â ferox, and identified those as representing C.Â spelea.[8] )Tj
T*(Grandidier had not designated a type specimen for the species, and to maintain )Tj
T*(C.Â spelea as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues )Tj
T*(designated a specimen to serve as the type specimen \(specifically, a )Tj
T*(neotype\).[9] )Tj
T*( Lamberton recognized a third species, Cryptoprocta antamba, on the basis of a )Tj
T*(mandible \(lower jaw\) with abnormally broad spacing between the condyloid )Tj
T*(processes at the back.[10] He also referred two femora \(upper leg bones\) and a )Tj
T*(tibia \(lower leg bone\) intermediate in size between C.Â spelea and C.Â ferox to )Tj
T*(this species.[11] The specific name refers to the "antamba", an animal )Tj
T*(allegedly from southern Madagascar described by Ã‰tienne de Flacourt in 1658 as )Tj
T*(a large, rare, leopard-like carnivore that eats men and calves and lives in )Tj
T*(remote mountainous areas;[12] it may have been the giant fossa.[13] Goodman and )Tj
T*(colleagues could not locate Lamberton's material of Cryptoprocta antamba, but )Tj
T*(suggested that it was based on an abnormal C.Â spelea.[14] Together, the fossa )Tj
T*(and C.Â spelea form the genus Cryptoprocta within the family Eupleridae, which )Tj
T*(also includes the other Malagasy carnivoransâ€”the falanouc, the fanalokas, and )Tj
T*(the Galidiinae. DNA sequence studies suggest that the Eupleridae form a single )Tj
T*(natural \(monophyletic\) group and are most closely related to the mongooses of )Tj
T*(Eurasia and mainland Africa.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Although some morphological differences between the two fossa species have )Tj
T*(been described,[16] these may be allometric \(growth-related\), and in their 1986 )Tj
T*(Mammalian Species account of the fossa, Michael KÃ¶hncke and Klaus Leonhardt )Tj
T*(wrote that the two were morphologically identical.[17] However, remains of C.Â )Tj
T*(spelea are larger than any living C.Â ferox. Goodman and colleagues found that )Tj
T*(skull measurements in specimens they identified as C.Â spelea were 1.07 to 1.32 )Tj
T*(times as large as in adult C.Â ferox, and postcranial measurements were 1.19 to )Tj
T*(1.37 times as large.[8] The only specimen of C.Â spelea in which condylobasal )Tj
T*(length \(a measure of total skull length\) could be ascertained measured 153.4Â mm )Tj
T*(\(6.04Â in\), compared to a range of 114.5 to 133.3 mm \(4.51 to 5.25Â in\) in adult )Tj
T*(C.Â ferox. Humerus \(upper arm bone\) length in twelve C.Â spelea is 122.7 to 146.8 )Tj
T*(mm \(4.83 to 5.78Â in\), averaging 137.9Â mm \(5.43Â in\), compared to 108.5 to 127.5 )Tj
T*(mm \(4.27 to 5.02Â in\), averaging 116.1Â mm \(4.57Â in\), in the extant fossa.[18] )Tj
T*(Body mass estimates for C.Â spelea range from 17Â kg \(37Â lb\)[19] to 20Â kg \(44Â )Tj
T*(lb\),[20] and it was among the largest carnivores of the island.[21] By )Tj

T*(survey of the boletes of New England.[2][3] When the name of a species is )Tj
T*(contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, )Tj
T*(the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as )Tj
T*(apud; for this reason, the name and authority are written Boletus Frostii )Tj
T*(Russell apud Frost in some older literature.[4]Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made )Tj
T*(reference to B.Â frostii in 1950 during an address to the Mycological Society of )Tj
T*(America, in which he spoke about the role of the amateur in discovering new )Tj
T*(species: "They would have informed us all about the man Russell, who named a )Tj
T*(fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine )Tj
T*(new bolete for his friend Russell. Boletus Frostii and Boletus Russellii are )Tj
T*(mushrooms with character, even though they were described by amateurs."[5] )Tj
T*(However, in attempting to establish a lectotype specimen, mycologist Roy )Tj
T*(Halling examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; )Tj
T*(he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, )Tj
T*(further suggesting "there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected B.Â )Tj
T*(frostii or wrote a description of it."[6] )Tj
T*( William Murrill in 1909 placed the species in the genus Suillellus,[7] while )Tj
T*(Sanshi Imai transferred it to Tubiporus in 1968;[1] both of these genera have )Tj
T*(since been folded into Boletus.[8] In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he )Tj
T*(found in Florida; although he originally described it as a subspecies of B.Â )Tj
T*(frostii,[9] he later considered the differences between the taxa significant )Tj
T*(enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species.[4] )Tj
T*( Boletus frostii is commonly known as "Frost's bolete"[10] or the "apple )Tj
T*(bolete". In Mexico, its vernacular name is panza agria, which translates to )Tj
T*("sour belly".[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The shape of the cap of the young fruit body ranges from a half sphere to )Tj
T*(convex, later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed, with a )Tj
T*(diameter of 5â€“15Â cm \(2.0â€“5.9Â in\).[12] The edge of the cap is curved inward, )Tj
T*(although as it ages it can uncurl and turn upward. In moist conditions, the cap )Tj
T*(surface is sticky as a result of its cuticle, which is made of gelatinized )Tj
T*(hyphae. If the fruit body has dried out after a rain, the cap is especially )Tj
T*(shiny,[4] sometimes appearing finely areolate \(having a pattern of block-like )Tj
T*(areas similar to cracked, dried mud\).[12] Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom )Tj
T*(on the cap surface.[13] )Tj
T*( The color is bright red initially, but fades with age. The flesh is up to 2.5Â )Tj
T*(cm \(1.0Â in\) thick, and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon )Tj
T*(yellow.[12] The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising, )Tj
T*(so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately, while others turn blue )Tj
T*(weakly and slowly.[4] )Tj
T*( The tubes comprising the pore surface \(the hymenium\) are 9â€“15Â mm deep, yellow )Tj
T*(to olivaceous yellow \(mustard yellow\), turning dingy blue when bruised. The )Tj
T*(pores are small \(2 to 3 per mm\), circular, and until old age a deep red color )Tj
T*(that eventually becomes paler. The pore surface is often beaded with yellowish )Tj
T*(droplets when young \(a distinguishing characteristic\), and readily stains blue )Tj
T*(when bruised. The stem is 4 to 12 cm \(1.6 to 4.7 in\) long, and 1 to 2.5 cm \(0.4 )Tj
T*(to 1.0 in\) thick at its apex. It is roughly equal in thickness throughout its )Tj
T*(length, though it may taper somewhat toward the top; some specimens may appear )Tj
T*(ventricose \(swollen in the middle\).[12] The stem surface is mostly red, or )Tj
T*(yellowish near the base; it is reticulateâ€”characterized by ridges arranged in )Tj
T*(the form of a net-like pattern.[12]Mycelia, visible at the base of the stem, )Tj
T*(are yellowish white to light yellow.[4] )Tj
T*( The spore print of B.Â frostii is olive brown.[12] The spores are thick walled, )Tj
T*(smooth, and spindle shaped, with dimensions of 11â€“15 by 4â€“5Â Âµm. Longer spores )Tj
T*(up to 18Â Âµm long may also be present.[12] The cap cuticle, or pileipellis, is )Tj
T*(made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3â€“6Â Âµm wide.[14] The )Tj
T*(spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four spored and measure 26â€“35 by )Tj
T*(10.5â€“11.5Â Âµm. Cystidia are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, )Tj
T*(and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of B.Â frostii. These hyaline )Tj
T*(\(translucent\) cells measure 30â€“53 long by 7.5â€“14Â Âµm wide, and range in shape )Tj

T*( [edit] Edibility and nutritional composition )Tj
T*( In 1910, Murrill wrote of this mushroom's edibility: "Usually viewed with )Tj
T*(suspicion because of its red hymenium, but its properties are not accurately )Tj
T*(known."[15] Since then, several authors have advised against consuming the )Tj
T*(species, due to its resemblance to other toxic red-capped boletes.[10][12][16] )Tj
T*(In his 100 Edible Mushrooms \(2007\), Michael Kuo notes that although the )Tj
T*(mushroom is apparently edible for some, it "affects others negatively".[17] )Tj
T*(Despite these warnings, Boletus frostii is edible, and David Arora mentions )Tj
T*(that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico;[11] a 1997 study suggests )Tj
T*(that it is only consumed in rural areas in QuerÃ©taro state.[18] Its taste and )Tj
T*(odor have been described as "pleasant"[10] or "sweet"[19] and somewhat like )Tj
T*(citrus,[13] although the cuticle of the cap may taste acidic.[12] )Tj
T*( Chemical analysis of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed them to )Tj
T*(have the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 3.23Â milligrams per gram )Tj
T*(of mushroom \(mg/g\); dietary fiber 30.24Â mg/g; fat 3.68Â mg/g; and protein 15.81Â )Tj
T*(mg/g. The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 45Â mg/g, slightly )Tj
T*(more than the common button mushroom \(Agaricus bisporus\), which had 35Â mg/g. )Tj
T*(The majority of this total was oleic acid \(19.5Â mg/g\), followed by linoleic )Tj
T*(acid \(16.8Â mg/g\) and palmitic acid \(16.9Â mg/g\).[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Similar species )Tj
T*( Other red-capped boletes include the poisonous B.Â flammans and B.Â )Tj
T*(rubroflammeus; the former grows most commonly under conifers, the latter in )Tj
T*(association with hardwoods in eastern North America and southern Arizona.[11] )Tj
T*(Often confused with B.Â frostii are B.Â permagnificus and B.Â siculus, but the )Tj
T*(latter two species are known only from Europe and always grow in association )Tj
T*(with oaks.[20][21] The fruit bodies of young specimens of B.Â kermesinus, newly )Tj
T*(described from Japan in 2011, are similar in appearance to B.Â frostii. In )Tj
T*(addition to its distribution, B.Â kermesinus can be distinguished from B.Â )Tj
T*(frostii by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stem in which the )Tj
T*(reticulum is not as deep and coarse.[22]B.Â pseudofrostii, found in Belize, )Tj
T*(produces smaller caps that are 1.7 to 2.0 cm \(0.7 to 0.8 in\) in )Tj
T*(diameter.[23]Boletus russelli, found in eastern North America, has a red to )Tj
T*(reddish-brown cap and reticulate stem, but its pore surface is yellow, and the )Tj
T*(fruit body does not bruise blue.[17] )Tj
T*( Boletus floridanus differs from B.Â frostii in having a lighter cap color and )Tj
T*(in the texture of the cap surface: it is tomentose \(covered with dense, short, )Tj
T*(soft, matted hairs\) or velutinous \(like velvet\), compared to the relatively )Tj
T*(smooth surface of B.Â frostii. Singer notes that although the physical )Tj
T*(characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the )Tj
T*(area of origin can reliably distinguish them: B.Â floridanus is found on shaded )Tj
T*(lawns and scrubland in open oak stands in non-tropical regions of Florida, )Tj
T*(typically on grassy or sandy soil, where it fruits between May and October.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology, habitat, and distribution )Tj
T*( Boletus frostii is a mycorrhizal species,[24] meaning that the fungus forms )Tj
T*(associations with the roots of various species of trees. These associations are )Tj
T*(mutualistic, because the fungus absorbs mineral nutrients from the soil and )Tj
T*(channels these into the plant, while the plant provides the fungus with sugars, )Tj
T*(a product of photosynthesis. The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is )Tj
T*(the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal, )Tj
T*(nutrient-absorbing rootlets of the host plant. The fungus forms an extensive )Tj
T*(underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root )Tj
T*(sheath, effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The )Tj
T*(hyphae also invade between the root cortical cells to form a Hartig net.[25] )Tj
T*(Using pure culture techniques, Boletus frostii has been shown to form )Tj
T*(mycorrhizae with Virginia pine \(Pinus virginiana\),[24] while a field study )Tj
T*(confirms a similar association with the oak Quercus laurina.[26] )Tj

T*(veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the )Tj
T*(blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed. )Tj
T*( The fruit bodies can reach heights of 18Â cm \(7.1Â in\) tall with caps that are )Tj
T*(up to 7.5Â cm \(3.0Â in\) wide. The tough woody stems are 1â€“2Â cm \(0.4â€“0.8Â in\) wide, )Tj

T*(deserticola might be confused include the desert fungus species Podaxis )Tj
T*(pistillaris and Montagnea arenaria. The edibility of Agaricus deserticola )Tj
T*(mushrooms is not known definitively. )Tj
T*( Formerly named Longula texensis \(among several other synonyms\), the fungus was )Tj
T*(transferred to the genus Agaricus in 2004 after molecular analysis showed it to )Tj
T*(be evolutionary related to species in that genus. In 2010, its specific epithet )Tj
T*(was changed to deserticola after it was discovered that the name Agaricus )Tj
T*(texensis was illegitimate, having been previously published for a different )Tj
T*(species. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomic history )Tj
T*( The species was first described scientifically as Secotium texense by Miles )Tj
T*(Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873, based on specimens sent to )Tj
T*(them from western Texas.[3]George Edward Massee transferred it to the genus )Tj
T*(Gyrophragmium in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species Gyrophragmium )Tj
T*(delilei, and because he felt that the structure of the volva as well as the )Tj
T*(internal morphology of the gleba excluded it from Secotium.[4] In 1916, William )Tj
T*(Murrill listed the species in Gymnopus, but did not explain the reason for the )Tj
T*(generic transfer.[5] In a 1943 publication, Sanford Zeller compared a number of )Tj
T*(similar secotioid genera: Galeropsis, Gyrophragmium and Montagnea. He concluded )Tj
T*(that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus Gyrophragmium and )Tj
T*(so created the new genus Longia with Longia texensis as the type species. The )Tj
T*(generic name was to honor William Henry Long, an American mycologist noted for )Tj
T*(his work in describing Gasteromycetes. Zeller also mentioned two additional )Tj
T*(synonyms:[2]Secotium decipiens \(Peck, 1895\),[6] and Podaxon strobilaceous )Tj
T*(\(Copeland, 1904\).[7] )Tj
T*( Two years later in 1945, Zeller pointed out that the use of the name Longia )Tj
T*(was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of rusts described by )Tj
T*(Hans Sydow in 1921,[8] so he proposed the name Longula and introduced the new )Tj
T*(combination Longula texensis in addition to L.Â texensis var. major.[9] The )Tj
T*(species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 phylogenetic )Tj
T*(study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with )Tj
T*(Agaricus,[10][11] a possibility insinuated by Curtis Gates Lloyd a century )Tj
T*(before.[12] This resulted in a new name in that genus, but it soon came to )Tj
T*(light that the name Agaricus texensis had already been used, ironically enough, )Tj
T*(by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853,[13] for a taxon now treated as a )Tj
T*(synonym of Flammulina velutipes.[14] Since this made the new Agaricus texensis )Tj
T*(an unusable homonym, Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the new name )Tj
T*(Agaricus deserticola in 2010.[15] The mushroom is commonly known as the )Tj
T*(gasteroid Agaricus.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Classification and phylogeny )Tj
T*( The classification of Agaricus deserticola has been under debate since the )Tj
T*(taxon was first described. It was thought by some mycologists to be a member of )Tj
T*(the Gasteromycetes, a grouping of fungi in the basidiomycota that do not )Tj
T*(actively discharge their spores. The Gasteromycetes are now known to be an )Tj
T*(artificial assemblage of morphologically similar fungi without any unifying )Tj
T*(evolutionary relationship. When the species was known as a Gyrophragmium, )Tj
T*(Fischer thought it to be close to Montagnites, a genus he considered a member )Tj
T*(of the Agaricaceae family.[17] Conrad suggested a relationship with Secotium, )Tj
T*(which he believed to be close to Agaricus.[18]Curtis Gates Lloyd said of )Tj
T*(Gyrophragmium: "[it] has no place in the Gasteromycetes. Its relations are more )Tj
T*(close to the Agarics. It is the connecting link between the two passing on one )Tj
T*(hand through Secotium to the true Gasteromycetes."[12] Morse believed that )Tj

T*( The species is now thought to have evolved from an Agaricus ancestor, and )Tj
T*(adapted for survival in dry habitats.[10][11] These adaptations include: a cap )Tj

T*(forcibly eject spores \(a mechanism known to depend on turgor pressure )Tj
T*(achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments\); and a partial veil that )Tj

T*(called secotioid development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi )Tj
T*(like Battarrea phalloides, Podaxis pistillaris, and Montagnea arenaria. )Tj
T*(Molecular analysis based on the sequences of the partial large subunit of )Tj
T*(ribosomal DNA and of the internal transcribed spacers shows that A.Â deserticola )Tj
T*(is closely related to but distinct from A.Â aridicola.[10] A separate analysis )Tj
T*(showed A.Â deserticola to be closely related to A.Â arvensis and A.Â )Tj
T*(abruptibulbus.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The fruit body of Agaricus deserticola can grow up to 5 to 18 cm \(2.0 to 7.1 )Tj
T*(in\) in height. Fresh specimens are usually white, but will age to a pale tan; )Tj
T*(dried fruit bodies are light gray or tan mixed with some yellow.[22] The cap is )Tj
T*(4 to 7.5 cm \(1.6 to 3.0 in\) in diameter, initially conic, later becoming convex )Tj
T*(to broadly convex as it matures.[23] The cap is composed of three distinct )Tj
T*(tissue layers: an outer volval layer, a middle cuticular layer \(cutis\), and an )Tj
T*(inner \(tramal\) layer which supports the gleba. The surface of the cap is white )Tj
T*(with yellow-brown to brown-tipped raised small scales; these scales result from )Tj
T*(the breakup of the volva and the cutis.[24] )Tj
T*( Initially, the caps are covered by a peridiumâ€”an outer covering layer of )Tj
T*(tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, the lower part of )Tj
T*(the peridium begin to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near )Tj
T*(where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of )Tj
T*(tearing is variable; in some instances the slits may appear higher up on the )Tj
T*(peridium, in others the peridium rips more irregularly.[12][22] The peridium )Tj
T*(may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of )Tj
T*(the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided )Tj
T*(into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form )Tj
T*(irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it )Tj
T*(becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, )Tj
T*(and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.[16] )Tj
T*( The stem is cylindrical, 4 to 15 cm \(1.6 to 5.9 in\) long and 1 to 2 cm \(0.4 to )Tj
T*(0.8 in\) thick. It is shaped like a narrow club, and the base may reach widths )Tj
T*(up to 4.5Â cm \(1.8Â in\). It is typically white, staining yellow to orange-yellow )Tj
T*(or pink when bruised, and becomes woody with age.[16][24] Mature specimens )Tj
T*(develop longitudinal grooves in maturity.[25] Numerous white rhizoids are )Tj
T*(present at the base of the stem; these root-like outgrowths of fungal mycelium )Tj
T*(help the mushroom attach to its substrate.[24] The apex of the stem extends )Tj
T*(into the gleba to form a columella that reaches the top of the cap. The )Tj
T*(internal gills are free from attachment to the stem,[2] but are attached )Tj
T*(full-length to the inside of the cap.[24] The partial veil is thick, white, and )Tj
T*(often sloughs off as the cap expands.[23] )Tj
T*( A larger variety of the mushroom has been described by Zeller,[2]A.Â )Tj
T*(deserticola var. major \(originally Longula texensis var. major\), whose range )Tj
T*(overlaps that of the typical variety. Its caps are scalier than the typical )Tj
T*(variety, and range from 6 to 12 cm \(2.4 to 4.7 in\) or more in diameter, with a )Tj
T*(stem 10 to 25 cm \(3.9 to 9.8 in\) and up to 4.5Â cm \(1.8Â in\) thick.[16][24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Microscopic characteristics )Tj
T*( In deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores appear almost black, tinged )Tj
T*(with purple.[22] The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, )Tj
T*(thick-walled, and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid \(not absorbing iodine )Tj
T*(when stained with Melzer's reagent\), black-brown, and have dimensions of )Tj

T*( [edit] Edibility )Tj
T*( The edibility of the fruit bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known )Tj
T*(definitively, and there are conflicting opinions in the literature. One popular )Tj

T*(young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.[23] However, other sources )Tj
T*(claim that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided.[20][27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Fruit body development )Tj
T*( In one early study of the mushroom's development, the fruit bodies appeared )Tj
T*(above the surface of the ground two or three days after rainfall or an )Tj
T*(irrigation, and required between five and eight days to mature. Slender and )Tj
T*(fragile rhizomorphsâ€”dense masses of hyphae that form root-like structuresâ€”grow )Tj
T*(horizontally 2.5 to 5 cm \(1.0 to 2.0 in\) below the soil surface. Fruit bodies )Tj
T*(start as enlarged tips on the rhizomorphs, and manifest as numerous small, )Tj
T*(almost-spherical protuberances just beneath the surface of the soil. When the )Tj
T*(fruit bodies reach a diameter of about 4 to 6 mm \(0.16 to 0.24 in\), the stem )Tj
T*(and peridial regions begin to be distinguishable; the peridial region first )Tj
T*(appears as a small swelling at the apex of the much larger stem regions.[22] )Tj
T*( The fruit bodies push upward through the soil when they are about 2Â cm \(0.8Â )Tj
T*(in\) tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the peridium becomes )Tj
T*(more rounded, increasing in size until maturity. At about the time the peridium )Tj
T*(reaches 1Â cm \(0.4Â in\) or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an )Tj
T*(upward tension on the tissue of the partial veil, and it begins to pull away )Tj
T*(from the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the )Tj
T*(stem, rather than to the attachment at the edge of the peridium, and the veil )Tj
T*(separates from the stem. The lower edge of the peridium is further stretched as )Tj
T*(it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba )Tj
T*(to dry out rapidly. If the veil tissue at the base of the stem is stronger than )Tj
T*(that attached to the edge of the peridium, the veil can rip so it remains )Tj
T*(attached to the stem as a ring. Scales begin to appear on the surface of the )Tj
T*(peridium of some specimens at about this time.[22]  )Tj

T*(are only a few per flower, saffron is the most expensive spice in the )Tj
T*(world.[16][17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Etymology )Tj
T*( The ultimate origin of the English word saffron is, like that of the )Tj
T*(cultivated saffron clone itself, of somewhat uncertain origin. It immediately )Tj
T*(stems from the Latin word safranum via the 12th-century Old French term safran. )Tj

T*(Parsi \(now known as Farsi\) which is the first language recorded as using this )Tj
T*(elegant material for cooking thousands of years ago. )Tj
T*( [edit] Species )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The domesticated saffron crocus, Crocus sativus, is an autumn-flowering )Tj
T*(perennial plant unknown in the wild. Its progenitors are possibly the eastern )Tj
T*(Mediterranean autumn-flowering Crocus cartwrightianus, which is also known as )Tj
T*("wild saffron" and originated in Greece. The saffron crocus likely resulted )Tj
T*(when C. cartwrightianus was subjected to extensive artificial selection by )Tj
T*(growers seeking longer stigmas. C. thomasii and C. pallasii are other possible )Tj
T*(sources. )Tj
T*( It is a sterile triploid form, which means that three homologous sets of )Tj
T*(chromosomes compose each specimen's genetic complement; C. sativus bears eight )Tj
T*(chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total. Being sterile, the purple )Tj
T*(flowers of Crocus sativus fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on )Tj
T*(human assistance: corms, underground bulb-like starch-storing organs, must be )Tj
T*(dug up, broken apart, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing )Tj
T*(via this vegetative division up to ten "cormlets" that can grow into new plants )Tj
T*(in the next season. The compact corms are small brown globules that can measure )Tj
T*(as large as 5 centimetres \(2.0Â in\) in diameter, have a flat base, and are )Tj
T*(shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the )Tj
T*("corm tunic". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up )Tj
T*(to 5Â cm above the plant's neck. )Tj
T*( The plant grows to a height of 20â€“30Â cm \(8â€“12Â in\), and sprouts 5â€“11 white and )Tj
T*(non-photosynthetic leafs known as cataphylls. They are membrane-like structures )Tj
T*(that cover and protect the crocus's 5â€“11 true leaves as they bud and develop. )Tj
T*(The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are )Tj
T*(1â€“3Â mm in diameter, either expand after the flowers have opened )Tj
T*(\("hysteranthous"\) or do so simultaneously with their blooming \("synanthous"\). )Tj
T*(C. sativus cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when )Tj
T*(the plant is irrigation relatively early in the growing season. Its floral )Tj
T*(axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear bracteoles, or specialised leaves that )Tj
T*(sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as pedicels. After )Tj
T*(aestivating in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to 40Â cm \(16Â )Tj
T*(in\) in length. In autumn, purple buds appear. Only in October, after most other )Tj
T*(flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers )Tj
T*(develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more )Tj
T*(striated mauve. The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon )Tj
T*(flowering, plants average less than 30Â cm \(12Â in\) in height. A three-pronged )Tj

T*( Saffron contains more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also )Tj
T*(has many nonvolatile active components, many of which are carotenoids, )Tj
T*(including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various Î±- and Î²-carotenes. However, )Tj
T*(saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of Î±-crocin. This )Tj
T*(crocin is trans-crocetin di-\(Î²-D-gentiobiosyl\) ester; it bears the systematic )Tj
T*(\(IUPAC\) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin )Tj
T*(underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. )Tj
T*(Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either )Tj
T*(monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated )Tj
T*(polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When )Tj

T*(carotenoids naturally present within the retina of the human eye. )Tj
T*( When saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic )Tj
T*(action, splits picrocrocin to yield Dâ€“glucose and a free safranal molecule. )Tj
T*(Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.[31] )Tj
T*(Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry )Tj
T*(saffron's volatile fraction in some samples. A second element underlying )Tj
T*(saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, the scent )Tj
T*(of which has been described as "saffron, dried hay like". Chemists found this )Tj
T*(to be the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance despite its being )Tj
T*(present in a lesser quantity than safranal. Dry saffron is highly sensitive to )Tj
T*(fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of )Tj
T*(light and oxidizing agents. It must therefore be stored away in air-tight )Tj
T*(containers in order to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is )Tj
T*(somewhat more resistant to heat. )Tj
T*( [edit] Grades )Tj
T*( Saffron is graded via laboratory measurement of crocin \(colour\), picrocrocin )Tj
T*(\(taste\), and safranal \(fragrance\) content. Determination of non-stigma content )Tj
T*(\("floral waste content"\) and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material )Tj
T*(\("ash"\) are also key. Grading standards are set by the International )Tj
T*(Organization for Standardization, a federation of national standards bodies. )Tj
T*(ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes four empirical colour )Tj
T*(intensity grades: IV \(poorest\), III, II, and I \(finest quality\). Samples are )Tj
T*(assigned grades by gauging the spice's crocin content, revealed by measurements )Tj
T*(of crocin-specific spectroscopic absorbance. Graders measure absorbances of )Tj
T*(440-nm light by dry saffron samples. Higher absorbances imply greater crocin )Tj
T*(concentration, and thus a greater colourative intensity. These data are )Tj
T*(measured through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories )Tj
T*(worldwide. These colour grades proceed from grades with absorbances lower than )Tj
T*(80 \(for all category IV saffron\) up to 190 or greater \(for category I\). The )Tj
T*(world's finest samples \(the selected most red-maroon tips of stigmas picked )Tj
T*(from the finest flowers\) receive absorbance scores in excess of 250. Market )Tj
T*(prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO scores. However, many )Tj
T*(growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. They prefer a )Tj
T*(more holistic method of sampling batches of thread for taste, aroma, )Tj
T*(pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by )Tj
T*(practised wine tasters. )Tj
T*( Despite such attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive )Tj
T*(history of saffron adulterationâ€”particularly among the cheapest )Tj
T*(gradesâ€”continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in )Tj
T*(Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were )Tj
T*(executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in )Tj
T*(extraneous substances like beets, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or )Tj
T*(the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods )Tj
T*(included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable )Tj
T*(oil. However, powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, )Tj
T*(paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also )Tj
T*(consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in )Tj
T*(India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian )Tj
T*(imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development )Tj
T*(that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The documented history of saffron cultivation spans more than three millennia. )Tj
T*(The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was Crocus cartwrightianus. )Tj
T*(Human cultivators bred wild specimens by selecting for unusually long stigmas; )Tj
T*(thus, a sterile mutant form of C. cartwrightianus, C. sativus, likely emerged )Tj
T*(in late Bronze Age Crete. )Tj
T*( [edit] Eastern )Tj
T*( Saffron was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled )Tj
T*(under Ashurbanipal. Documentation of saffron's use over the span of 4,000 years )Tj
T*(in the treatment of some 90 illnesses has been uncovered. Saffron-based )Tj
T*(pigments have indeed been found in 50,000 year-old depictions of prehistoric )Tj
T*(places in northwest Iran. The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in )Tj
T*(their remedies and magical potions. Saffron was an article of long-distance )Tj
T*(trade before the Minoan palace culture's 2nd millennium BC peak. Ancient )Tj
T*(Persians cultivated Persian saffron \(Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii'\) in Derbena, )Tj
T*(Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads )Tj
T*(were woven into textiles, ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, )Tj
T*(perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads would thus be scattered )Tj
T*(across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. )Tj
T*(Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and )Tj
T*(aphrodisiac. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian )Tj
T*(saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds. )Tj
T*(Alexander's troops imitated the practice from the Persians and brought )Tj
T*(saffron-bathing to Greece. )Tj
T*( Conflicting theories explain saffron's arrival in South Asia. Kashmiri and )Tj
T*(Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900â€“2500 years ago. )Tj
T*(Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior )Tj
T*(to 500 BC, attributing it to a Persian transplantation of saffron corms to )Tj
T*(stock new gardens and parks. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a )Tj
T*(dye and a treatment for melancholy. Its use in foods and dyes subsequently )Tj
T*(spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks wear saffron-coloured robes; )Tj
T*(however, the robes are not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less )Tj

T*(Adapiforms are sometimes referred to as being "lemur-like", although the )Tj
T*(diversity of both lemurs and adapiforms do not support this comparison. The two )Tj
T*(leading taxonomic classifications for the suborder divide living strepsirrhine )Tj
T*(primates into either two superfamilies \(Lemuroidea and Lorisoidea\) within the )Tj
T*(infraorder Lemuriformes or two infraorders, Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes. The )Tj

T*(Strepsirrhini excludes the tarsiers, which are now grouped in the other major )Tj
T*(primate suborder, Haplorhini, along with the monkeys and apes \(simians or )Tj

T*(fossils" or "primitive primates". Instead, they have evolved for millions of )Tj
T*(years under natural selection, and have diversified to fill many ecological )Tj
T*(niches. Some of their traits may be ancestral to primates, while others are )Tj
T*(unique to strepsirrhines. )Tj
T*( Strepsirrhines are defined by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a )Tj
T*(smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large olfactory lobes for smell, a )Tj
T*(vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an )Tj
T*(epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve )Tj
T*(their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the )Tj
T*(eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates )Tj
T*(produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from )Tj
T*(their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a )Tj
T*(specialized set of teeth in the front, lower part of the mouth mostly used for )Tj
T*(combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to )Tj
T*(characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is )Tj
T*(not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a )Tj
T*(grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are )Tj
T*(inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms )Tj
T*(possessed grooming claws. )Tj
T*( The taxonomy of strepsirrhines is controversial and has a complicated history. )Tj

T*(record. Lemuriform primates may have evolved from either cercamoniines or )Tj
T*(sivaladapids, both of which were adapiforms that may have originated in Asia. )Tj
T*(They were once thought to have evolved from adapids, a more specialized and )Tj
T*(younger branch of adapiform primarily from Europe. Lemurs rafted to Madagascar )Tj
T*(between 47 and 54Â mya, whereas the lorises split from the African galagos )Tj
T*(around 40Â mya and later colonized Asia. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines )Tj

T*( [edit] Evolutionary history )Tj
T*( Strepsirrhines include the extinct adapiforms and the lemuriform primates, )Tj
T*(which include lemurs and lorisoids \(lorises, pottos, and galagos\). The )Tj
T*(lemuriforms, and particularly the lemurs of Madagascar, are often portrayed )Tj
T*(inappropriately as "living fossils" or as examples of "primitive", "basal", or )Tj
T*("inferior" primates. These views have historically hindered the understanding )Tj
T*(of mammalian evolution and the evolution of strepsirrhine traits, such as their )Tj
T*(reliance on smell \(olfaction\), characteristics of their skeletal anatomy, and )Tj
T*(their brain size, which is relatively small compared simian primates. In the )Tj
T*(case of lemurs, natural selection has driven this isolated population of )Tj
T*(primates to diversify significantly and fill a rich variety of ecological )Tj
T*(niches, despite their smaller and less complex brains compared to simians. )Tj
T*( The origin of the earliest primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and )Tj
T*(haplorhines \(simians and tarsiers\) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of )Tj
T*(origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil )Tj
T*(record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is )Tj
T*(very detailed, the fossil record from the tropicsâ€”where primates most likely )Tj
T*(evolvedâ€”is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other )Tj
T*(major clades \(groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants\) of )Tj
T*(eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and )Tj
T*(primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between )Tj
T*(primate lineages and the amount of time since they diverged. Using this )Tj
T*(molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested )Tj
T*(that primates evolved more than 80â€“90Â mya, nearly 40Â million years before the )Tj
T*(first primates appear in the fossil record. )Tj
T*( The early primates include both nocturnal and diurnal small-bodied species, )Tj
T*(and all were arboreal, with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on )Tj
T*(small branches.Plesiadapiforms from the early Paleocene are sometimes )Tj
T*(considered "archaic primates" because their teeth resembled those of early )Tj
T*(primates, and because they possessed arboreal adaptations, such as a divergent )Tj
T*(hallux \(big toe\). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates, )Tj
T*(they may represent a paraphyletic group from which primates may or may not have )Tj
T*(directly evolved, and some genera may have been more closely related to )Tj
T*(colugos, also known as dermopterans or "flying lemurs", which are thought to be )Tj
T*(closely related to primates. )Tj
T*( The first true primates \(euprimates\) do not appear in the fossil record until )Tj
T*(the early Eocene \(~55Â mya\), at which point they radiated across the Northern )Tj
T*(Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the )Tj

T*(group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest )Tj
T*(that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent )Tj

T*(Eocene. Yet new calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the )Tj

T*(The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine )Tj

T*( [edit] Lemuriform evolution )Tj
T*( Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. American paleontologist Philip )Tj
T*(Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera )Tj
T*(of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of )Tj
T*(adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not )Tj
T*(strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils. Instead, )Tj
T*(lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or )Tj
T*(sivaladapids that immigrated to northern Africa. )Tj
T*( Until discoveries of three 40-million-year-old fossil lorisoids \(Karanisia, )Tj
T*(Saharagalago, and Wadilemur\) in the El Fayum deposits of Egypt between 1997 and )Tj
T*(2005, the oldest known lemuriforms had come from the early Miocene \(~20Â mya\) of )Tj
T*(Kenya and Uganda. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were )Tj
T*(present during the middle Eocene in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage )Tj
T*(and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then.Djebelemur from )Tj
T*(Tunisia dates to the late early or early middle Eocene \(52 to 46Â mya\) and has )Tj

T*( Strepsirrhine primates were first grouped under the genus Lemur by Swedish )Tj
T*(taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae published in )Tj
T*(1758. At the time, only three species were recognized, one of which \(a colugo\) )Tj
T*(is no longer recognized as a primate. In 1785, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert )Tj
T*(divided the genus Lemur into two genera: Prosimia for the lemurs, colugos, and )Tj
T*(tarsiers and Tardigradus for the lorises. Ten years later, Ã‰. Geoffroy and )Tj
T*(Georges Cuvier grouped the tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their )Tj
T*(hindlimb morphology, a view supported by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm )Tj
T*(Illiger, who placed them in the family Macrotarsi while placing the lemurs and )Tj
T*(tarsiers in the family Prosimia \(Prosimii\) in 1811. The use of the )Tj
T*(tarsier-galago classification continued for many years until 1898, when Dutch )Tj
T*(zoologist Ambrosius Hubrecht demonstrated two different types of placentation )Tj
T*(\(formation of a placenta\) in the two groups. )Tj
T*( English comparative anatomist William Henry Flower created the suborder )Tj
T*(Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were )Tj
T*(grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart's suborder )Tj
T*(Anthropoidea \(=Simiiformes\). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea )Tj
T*(contained the families Lemuridae \(lemurs, lorises, and galagos\), Chiromyidae )Tj
T*(\(aye-aye\), and Tarsiidae \(tarsiers\). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's )Tj
T*(suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, Ã‰. Geoffroy first named the )Tj
T*(suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went )Tj
T*(unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and )Tj
T*(reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the )Tj
T*(tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until )Tj
T*(1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume )Tj
T*(on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and )Tj
T*(more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between )Tj
T*(Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times. )Tj
T*( Most of the academic literature provides a basic framework for primate )Tj
T*(taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although most )Tj
T*(experts agree upon phylogeny, many disagree about nearly every level of primate )Tj
T*(classification.  )Tj
T*( [edit] Subordinal controversies )Tj
T*( The most commonly recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and )Tj
T*(early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both )Tj
T*(simians and the other prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the )Tj
T*(suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the )Tj
T*(strepsirrhines. Prosimii is one of the two traditional primate suborders and is )Tj
T*(based on evolutionary grades \(groups united by anatomical traits\) rather than )Tj
T*(phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on )Tj
T*(evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the )Tj
T*(Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the research )Tj
T*(literature and textbooks. )Tj
T*( Strepsirrhines are traditionally characterized by several symplesiomorphic )Tj
T*(\(ancestral\) traits not shared with the simians, particularly the rhinarium.[a] )Tj
T*(Other symplesiomorphies include long snouts, convoluted maxilloturbinals, )Tj
T*(relatively large olfactory bulbs, and smaller brains. The toothcomb is a )Tj
T*(synapomorphy \(shared, derived trait\) seen among lemuriforms, although it is )Tj
T*(frequently and incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade.[b] )Tj
T*(Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing a epitheliochorial )Tj
T*(placenta. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of )Tj
T*(producing their own vitamin C and do not need it supplied in their diet. )Tj
T*(Further genetic evidence for the relationship between tarsiers and simians as a )Tj
T*(haplorhine clade is the shared possession of three SINE markers. )Tj
T*( Because of their historically mixed assemblages which included tarsiers and )Tj
T*(close relatives of primates, both Prosimii and Strepsirrhini have been )Tj
T*(considered wastebasket taxa for "lower primates". Regardless, the strepsirrhine )Tj
T*(and haplorrhine clades are generally accepted and viewed as the preferred )Tj
T*(taxonomic division. Yet, tarsiers still closely resemble both strepsirrhines )Tj

T*(Lemuriformes \(or superfamily Lemuroidea\). )Tj
T*( The first fossil primate described was the adapiform Adapis parisiensis by )Tj
T*(French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1821, who compared it to a hyrax \("le )Tj
T*(Daman"\), then considered a member of a now obsolete group called pachyderms. It )Tj
T*(was not recognized as a primate until it was reevaluated in the early 1870s. )Tj
T*(Originally, adapiforms were all included under the family Adapidae, which was )Tj
T*(divided into two or three subfamilies: Adapinae, Notharctinae, and sometimes )Tj
T*(Sivaladapinae. All North American adapiforms were lumped under Notharctinae, )Tj
T*(while the Old World forms were usually assigned to Adapinae. Around the 1990s, )Tj
T*(two distinct groups of European "adapids" began to emerge, based on differences )Tj
T*(in the postcranial skeleton and the teeth. One of these two European forms was )Tj
T*(identified as cercamoniines, which were allied with the notharctids found )Tj
T*(mostly in North America, while the other group falls into the traditional )Tj
T*(adapid classification. The three major adapiform divisions are now typically )Tj
T*(regarded as three families within Adapiformes \(Notharctidae, Adapidae and )Tj
T*(Sivaladapidae\), but other divisions ranging from one to five families are used )Tj
T*(as well.  )Tj
T*( [edit] Anatomy and physiology )Tj
T*( All lemuriforms possess a specialized dental structure called a toothcomb,[76] )Tj
T*(with the exception of the aye-aye, in which the structure has been modified )Tj
T*(into two continually growing \(hypselodont\) incisors \(or canine teeth\), similar )Tj
T*(to those of rodents. The toothcomb consists of either two or four procumbent )Tj
T*(lower incisors and procumbent lower canine teeth followed by a canine-shaped )Tj
T*(premolar. It is used to comb the fur during oral grooming. Shed hairs that )Tj
T*(accumulate between the teeth of the toothcomb are removed by the sublingua or )Tj
T*("under-tongue". Lemuriforms also possess a grooming claw on the second digit of )Tj
T*(each foot for scratching.[76] Adapiforms did not possess a toothcomb. Instead, )Tj
T*(their lower incisors varied in orientationâ€”from somewhat procumbent to somewhat )Tj
T*(verticalâ€”and the lower canines were projected upwards and were often prominent. )Tj
T*(Adapiforms may have had a grooming claw, but there is little evidence of this. )Tj
T*( Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits \(eye sockets\) have a postorbital bar, )Tj
T*(a protective ring of bone created by a connection between the frontal and )Tj
T*(zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of )Tj
T*(bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in )Tj
T*(haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving )Tj
T*(stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living )Tj
T*(strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer )Tj
T*(behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum, which improves vision )Tj
T*(in low light,[76] but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This )Tj
T*(differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.[83] )Tj
T*( Strepsirrhine primates have a brain relatively comparable to or slightly )Tj
T*(larger in size than most mammals. Compared to simians, however, they have a )Tj
T*(relatively small brain-to-body size ratio. Strepsirrhines are also )Tj
T*(traditionally noted for their unfused mandibular symphysis \(two halves of the )Tj
T*(lower jaw\), however, fusion of the mandibular symphysis was common in )Tj
T*(adapiforms, notably Notharctus. Also, several extinct giant lemurs exhibited a )Tj
T*(fused mandibular symphysis. )Tj
T*( Many nocturnal species have large, independently movable ears,[88] although )Tj
T*(there are significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between )Tj
T*(species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs )Tj
T*(between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which )Tj
T*(surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which )Tj
T*(supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen )Tj
T*(in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the )Tj
T*(ectotympanic ring becomes attached to the edge of the auditory bulla. The )Tj
T*(tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not )Tj
T*(present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the )Tj
T*(internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. )Tj
T*(Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus \(ankle bones\) )Tj

T*(Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than )Tj
T*(20Â percent larger than females.  )Tj
T*( [edit] Rhinarium and olfaction )Tj
T*( Strepsirrhines have a long snout that ends in a moist and touch-sensitive )Tj
T*(rhinarium, similar to that of dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is )Tj
T*(surrounded by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted )Tj
T*(maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the )Tj
T*(incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the )Tj
T*(ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are )Tj
T*(comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals. )Tj
T*( The surface of the rhinarium does not have any olfactory receptors, so it is )Tj
T*(not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has )Tj
T*(sensitive touch receptors \(Merkel cells\). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums )Tj
T*(are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which )Tj
T*(runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by )Tj
T*(this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less )Tj
T*(mobile than the upper lips of simians.[99] The philtrum creates a gap )Tj
T*(\(diastema\) between the roots of the first two upper incisors. )Tj
T*( The strepsirrhine rhinarium can collect relatively non-volatile, fluid-based )Tj
T*(chemicals \(traditionally categorized as pheromones\) and transmit them to the )Tj
T*(vomeronasal organ \(VNO\), which is located below and in front of the nasal )Tj
T*(cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of )Tj
T*(cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The )Tj
T*(VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts \(also known as the )Tj
T*(incisive foramen\), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the )Tj
T*(mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the )Tj
T*(nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the )Tj
T*(accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the )Tj
T*(accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles )Tj
T*(emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and )Tj
T*(metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main )Tj
T*(olfactory system. )Tj
T*( All lemuriforms have a VNO, as do tarsiers and some New World monkeys.[108] )Tj
T*(Adapiforms exhibit the gap between the upper incisors, which indicates the )Tj
T*(presence of a VNO, but there is some disagreement over whether or not they )Tj
T*(possessed a rhinarium. )Tj
T*( [edit] Reproductive physiology )Tj
T*( Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, where the maternal )Tj
T*(blood does not come in direct contact with the fetal chorion like it does in )Tj
T*(the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two )Tj
T*(distinct chambers \(bicornuate\).[99] Despite having similar gestation periods to )Tj
T*(comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in )Tj
T*(strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as )Tj
T*(one-third the size of haplorhine newborns.[99] Extant strepsirrhines also have )Tj

T*(bone\) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger )Tj
T*(in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip. )Tj
T*( [edit] Behavior )Tj
T*( Approximately three-quarters of all extant strepsirrhine species are )Tj
T*(nocturnal, sleeping in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the )Tj
T*(day.[120] All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, )Tj
T*(while the lemurs of Madagascar are more variable in their activity cycles. The )Tj
T*(aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while )Tj
T*(ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet )Tj
T*(some or all of the brown lemurs \(Eulemur\) are cathemeral, which means they may )Tj
T*(be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and )Tj
T*(predation.[121] Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal )Tj
T*(activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive )Tj
T*(tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the )Tj
T*(retina.[88] Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the )Tj
T*(exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of )Tj
T*(which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality. )Tj
T*( Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species tends to be seasonal, particularly )Tj
T*(in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include the length of )Tj
T*(the wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the )Tj
T*(species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders )Tj
T*(compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are )Tj
T*(usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine )Tj
T*(primates.[99] Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three )Tj
T*(offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce )Tj
T*(multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are )Tj
T*(thought to be plesiomorphic \(ancestral\) for primates.[99] The young are )Tj
T*(precocial \(relatively mature and mobile\) at birth, but not as coordinated as )Tj
T*(ungulates \(hoofed mammals\). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged )Tj
T*(compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the )Tj
T*(mother's fur with their hands and feet.[99] )Tj
T*( Despite their relatively smaller brains compared to other primates, lemurs )Tj
T*(have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are )Tj
T*(comparable to those of seen in simians. However, their social intelligence )Tj
T*(differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which may )Tj
T*(be due to adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have )Tj
T*(not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to )Tj
T*(use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about )Tj
T*(the functional properties of the objects they are using. )Tj
T*( [edit] Social systems and communication )Tj
T*( The nocturnal strepsirrhines have been traditionally described as "solitary", )Tj
T*(although this term is no longer favored by the researchers who study them. Many )Tj
T*(are considered "solitary foragers", but many exhibit complex and diverse social )Tj
T*(organization, often overlapping home ranges, initiating social contact at )Tj
T*(night, and sharing sleeping sites during the day. Even the mating systems are )Tj
T*(variable, as seen in wooly lemurs, which live in monogamous breeding )Tj
T*(pairs.[126] Because of this social diversity among these solitary but social )Tj
T*(primates, whose level of social interaction is comparable to that of diurnal )Tj
T*(simians, alternative classifications have been proposed to emphasize their )Tj
T*(gregarious, dispersed, or solitary nature. )Tj
T*( Among extant strepsirrhines, only the diurnal and cathemeral lemurs have )Tj
T*(evolved to live in multi-male/multi-female groups, comparable to most living )Tj
T*(simians.[126] This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families \(Indriidae )Tj
T*(and Lemuridae\), is thought to have evolved independently. Group sizes are )Tj
T*(smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the )Tj

T*( Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking for much of their )Tj

T*(used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation )Tj
T*(restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, )Tj

T*( [edit] Locomotion )Tj
T*( Living strepsirrhines are predominantly arboreal, with only the ring-tailed )Tj

T*(quadrupedally \(on four legs\) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, )Tj

T*(leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for )Tj
T*(vertical clinging and leaping.[120] Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate )Tj
T*(climbers. )Tj
T*( Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons suggest a variety of )Tj
T*(locomotor behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis )Tj
T*(shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although they may have )Tj
T*(been quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and )Tj
T*(Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb )Tj
T*(proportions and joint surfaces comparable vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, )Tj
T*(but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that )Tj
T*(they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and )Tj
T*(Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations )Tj
T*(comparable to the brown lemurs. )Tj
T*( Primates primarily feed on fruits \(including seeds\), leaves \(including )Tj
T*(flowers\), and animal prey \(arthropods, small vertebrates, and eggs\). Diets vary )Tj
T*(markedly between strepsirrhine species. Like other leaf-eating \(folivorous\) )Tj
T*(primates, some strepsirrhines can digest cellulose and hemicellulose.[136] Some )Tj
T*(strepsirrhines, such as the galagos, slender lorises, and angwantibos are )Tj
T*(primarily insectivorous. Other species, such as fork-marked lemurs and )Tj
T*(needle-clawed bushbabies, specialize on tree gum, while indriids, sportive )Tj
T*(lemurs, and bamboo lemurs are folivores. Many strepsirrhines are frugivores )Tj
T*(\(fruit eaters\), and others, like the ring-tailed lemur and mouse lemurs, are )Tj
T*(omnivores, eating a mix of fruit, leaves, and animal matter. )Tj
T*( Among the adapiforms, frugivory seems to have been the most common diet, )Tj
T*(particularly for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and )Tj
T*(Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized )Tj
T*(adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp )Tj
T*(cusps on the teeth of some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and )Tj

T*(these regions are not as rich.[139] )Tj
T*( [edit] Conservation )Tj
T*( Like all other primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction )Tj
T*(due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of )Tj
T*(their habitat has been converted for human use, such as agriculture and )Tj
T*(pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main )Tj
T*(categories: habitat destruction, hunting \(for bushmeat or traditional )Tj
T*(medicine\), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although )Tj
T*(hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In )Tj
T*(Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, )Tj
T*(although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.[140] )Tj
T*( In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) announced )Tj
T*(that lemurs were the "most endangered mammals", due largely to elevated illegal )Tj
T*(logging and hunting following a political crisis in 2009.[141] In Southeast )Tj

T*( Comet Haleâ€“Bopp \(formally designated C/1995Â O1\) was perhaps the most widely )Tj
T*(observed comet of the 20th century and one of the brightest seen for many )Tj
T*(decades. It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18Â months, twice as long )Tj
T*(as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995, at a great distance from the Sun, )Tj
T*(raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it )Tj
T*(passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any )Tj
T*(degree of accuracy is very difficult, Haleâ€“Bopp met or exceeded most )Tj
T*(predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. The comet was dubbed )Tj
T*(the Great Comet of 1997. )Tj
T*( [edit] Discovery )Tj
T*( The comet was discovered on July 23, 1995 by two independent observers, Alan )Tj
T*(Hale and Thomas Bopp, both in the United States.[5] )Tj
T*( Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, )Tj
T*(and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced )Tj
T*(upon Haleâ€“Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 )Tj
T*(and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius.[6] )Tj
T*(Hale first established that there was no other deep-sky object near M70, and )Tj
T*(then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be )Tj
T*(in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving )Tj
T*(relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for )Tj
T*(Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.[7] )Tj
T*( Bopp did not own a telescope. He was out with friends near Stanfield, Arizona )Tj
T*(observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at )Tj
T*(the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted )Tj
T*(something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any )Tj
T*(other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were )Tj
T*(none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a )Tj
T*(Western Union telegram. Brian Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, )Tj
T*(laughed, "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got )Tj
T*(here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated )Tj
T*(coordinates."[8] )Tj
T*( The following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was )Tj
T*(given the designation C/1995Â O1. The discovery was announced in International )Tj
T*(Astronomical Union circular 6187.[6][9] )Tj
T*( The comet may have been observed by ancient Egyptians during the reign of )Tj
T*(pharaoh Pepi I \(2332â€“2283 BC\). In Pepi's pyramid in Saqqara is a text referring )Tj
T*(to an "nhh-star" as a companion of the pharaoh in the heavens, where "nhh" is )Tj
T*(the hieroglyph for long hair.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early observation )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2Â astronomical units \(AU\) )Tj
T*(from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and by far the greatest )Tj
T*(distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs.[11][12] )Tj
T*(Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible )Tj
T*(activity, but Haleâ€“Bopp already had an observable coma.[6] An image taken at )Tj
T*(the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed )Tj
T*(comet some 13Â AU from the Sun,[13] a distance at which most comets are )Tj

T*( Haleâ€“Bopp became visible to the naked eye in May 1996, and although its rate )Tj
T*(of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year,[16] )Tj
T*(scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. )Tj
T*(It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, )Tj
T*(but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen )Tj
T*(by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted )Tj
T*(skies.[17] )Tj
T*( The Internet was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that )Tj
T*(tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world )Tj
T*(became extremely popular. The Internet played a large role in encouraging the )Tj
T*(unprecedented public interest in comet Haleâ€“Bopp.[18] )Tj
T*( As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2ndÂ )Tj
T*(magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail )Tj
T*(pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away )Tj
T*(along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern )Tj
T*(Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.[19] Haleâ€“Bopp )Tj
T*(had its closest approach to Earth on March 22, 1997 at a distance of 1.315Â )Tj
T*(AU.[20] )Tj
T*( As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into a )Tj
T*(spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, )Tj
T*(and its dust tail stretched 40â€“45 degrees across the sky.[21][22] The comet was )Tj
T*(visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great )Tj
T*(comets are very close to the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Haleâ€“Bopp was )Tj
T*(visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] After perihelion )Tj
T*( After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial )Tj
T*(hemisphere, and its show was over as far as most of the northern hemisphere was )Tj
T*(concerned. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers )Tj
T*(than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see )Tj
T*(the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last )Tj
T*(naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the )Tj
T*(comet had remained visible without aid for 569Â days, or about 18 and a half )Tj
T*(months.[16] The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which )Tj
T*(was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.[16] )Tj
T*( The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by )Tj
T*(astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of )Tj
T*(25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of )Tj
T*(the CO-driven coma.[24]Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest )Tj
T*(comet Haleâ€“Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer.[25] Haleâ€“Bopp was again )Tj
T*(detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7AU from the Sun,[26] and again on )Tj
T*(2012 Aug 7 when it was 33.2AU from the Sun.[27] Astronomers expect that the )Tj
T*(comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which )Tj
T*(time it will be nearing 30thÂ magnitude.[28] By this time it will become very )Tj
T*(difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies )Tj
T*(of similar brightness. )Tj
T*( [edit] Orbital changes )Tj
T*( The comet likely made its last perihelion 4,200 years ago.[29] Its orbit is )Tj
T*(almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, which ensures that close )Tj
T*(approaches to planets are rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within )Tj
T*(0.77Â AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be affected by the planet's )Tj
T*(gravity.[29] The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of )Tj
T*(roughly 2,533Â years,[1] and it will next return to the inner Solar System )Tj
T*(around the year 4385.[4] Its greatest distance from the Sun \(aphelion\) will be )Tj
T*(about 370Â AU,[1] reduced from about 525Â AU.[30][31] )Tj
T*( Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on )Tj
T*(comets with high orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is )Tj
T*(generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Haleâ€“Bopp has )Tj
T*(about a 15%Â chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this )Tj
T*(process.[32] )Tj

T*(the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4Â AU, but no records of it have )Tj
T*(survived. Haleâ€“Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June )Tj
T*(2215Â BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215Â BC may )Tj
T*(have been its first passage through the inner Solar System.[30] )Tj
T*( The estimated probability of impacting Earth in future passages through the )Tj
T*(inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5 x 10âˆ’9 per orbit.[33] However, given )Tj
T*(that the comet nucleus is around 60Â km in diameter,[1] the consequences of such )Tj
T*(an impact would be apocalyptic. A calculation given by Weissman[33] )Tj
T*(conservatively estimates the diameter at 35Â km; an estimated density of 0.6 )Tj
T*(g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3 x 1019 g. An impact velocity of 52.5Â )Tj
T*(km/s yields an impact energy of 1.9 x 1032ergs, or 4.4 x 109megatons, about 44 )Tj
T*(times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event. )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientific results )Tj
T*( Comet Haleâ€“Bopp was observed intensively by astronomers during its perihelion )Tj
T*(passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these )Tj
T*(observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high \(up to )Tj
T*(2.0Ã—106 kg/s\),[34] which may have made the inner coma optically thick.[35] )Tj
T*(Based on the properties of the dust grainsâ€”high temperature, high albedo and )Tj
T*(strong 10Â Î¼m silicate emission featureâ€”the astronomers concluded the dust )Tj
T*(grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.[36] )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp showed the highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. )Tj
T*(Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the )Tj
T*(dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the )Tj
T*(grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Haleâ€“Bopp )Tj
T*(were smaller than inferred in any other comet.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sodium tail )Tj
T*( One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of )Tj
T*(tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Haleâ€“Bopp also )Tj
T*(exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with )Tj
T*(dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other )Tj
T*(comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Haleâ€“Bopp's sodium tail )Tj
T*(consisted of neutral atoms \(not ions\), and extended to some 50 million )Tj
T*(kilometres in length.[38] )Tj
T*( The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner coma, although not )Tj
T*(necessarily the nucleus. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a )Tj
T*(source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding )Tj
T*(the nucleus, and 'sputtering' of sodium from dust grains by ultraviolet light. )Tj
T*(It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating )Tj
T*(Haleâ€“Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow[38] and diffuse[39] components of the )Tj
T*(tail may have different origins.[40] )Tj
T*( While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and )Tj
T*(the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail )Tj
T*(appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven )Tj
T*(away from the comet's head by radiation pressure.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Deuterium abundance )Tj
T*( The abundance of deuterium in comet Haleâ€“Bopp in the form of heavy water was )Tj
T*(found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Haleâ€“Bopp's deuterium )Tj
T*(abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts )Tj
T*(are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, )Tj
T*(they cannot be the only source.[41] )Tj
T*( Deuterium was also detected in many other hydrogen compounds in the comet. The )Tj
T*(ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to )Tj
T*(compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in )Tj
T*(interstellar clouds, rather than in the solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of )Tj
T*(ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Haleâ€“Bopp formed at )Tj
T*(temperatures of around 25â€“45Â Kelvin.[41] )Tj

T*( Haleâ€“Bopp was the first comet where the noble gas argon was detected.[43] )Tj
T*(Noble gases are chemically inert and highly volatile, and since different noble )Tj
T*(elements have different sublimation temperatures, they can be used for probing )Tj
T*(the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation )Tj
T*(temperature of 16â€“20Â K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative )Tj
T*(to the solar abundance,[44] while argon with its higher sublimation temperature )Tj
T*(was enriched relative to the solar abundance.[43] Together these observations )Tj
T*(indicate that the interior of Haleâ€“Bopp has always been colder than 35â€“40Â K, )Tj
T*(but has at some point been warmer than 20Â K. Unless the solar nebula was much )Tj
T*(colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the )Tj
T*(comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward )Tj
T*(to the Oort cloud.[43] )Tj
T*( [edit] Rotation )Tj
T*( Comet Haleâ€“Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its )Tj
T*(nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the )Tj
T*(material streaming away from these jets[45] allowed astronomers to measure the )Tj
T*(rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 )Tj
T*(minutes.[46] )Tj
T*( [edit] Binary nucleus question )Tj
T*( In 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary )Tj
T*(nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Haleâ€“Bopp's dust )Tj
T*(emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, )Tj
T*(and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, )Tj
T*(but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30Â km, with the main )Tj
T*(nucleus being about 70Â km across, and would orbit in about three days at a )Tj
T*(distance of about 180Â km.[47] This analysis was confirmed by observations in )Tj
T*(1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which )Tj
T*(had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.[48] )Tj
T*( Although observations using adaptive optics in late 1997 and early 1998 showed )Tj
T*(a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus,[49] controversy still exists )Tj
T*(over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus.[15] )Tj
T*(The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations.[50][51] )Tj
T*(Also, while comets have been observed to break up before,[52] no case has )Tj
T*(previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of )Tj
T*(this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the )Tj
T*(gravity of the Sun and planets. )Tj
T*( [edit] UFO claims )Tj
T*( In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek of Houston, Texas took a CCD )Tj
T*(image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. )Tj
T*(When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called )Tj
T*(the Art Bell radio program Coast to Coast AM to announce that he had discovered )Tj
T*(a "Saturn-like object" following Haleâ€“Bopp. UFO enthusiasts, such as remote )Tj
T*(viewing proponent Courtney Brown, soon concluded that there was an alien )Tj
T*(spacecraft following the comet.[53] )Tj
T*( Several astronomers, including Alan Hale,[54] claimed the object was simply an )Tj
T*(8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer )Tj
T*(program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.[55] Later, Art Bell )Tj
T*(even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous )Tj
T*(astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers )Tj
T*(Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the )Tj
T*(alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.[56] )Tj
T*( A few months later, in March 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass )Tj
T*(suicide with the intention of teleporting to a spaceship they believed was )Tj
T*(flying behind the comet.[57] )Tj
T*( Nancy Lieder, a self-proclaimed contactee who claims to receive messages from )Tj

T*( Felice Beato \(1832 â€“ 29 January 1909\), also known as Felix Beato,[note 1] was )Tj
T*(an Italianâ€“British photographer. He was one of the first people to take )Tj
T*(photographs in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted )Tj
T*(for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and )Tj
T*(landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the )Tj
T*(opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were )Tj
T*(unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work )Tj
T*(provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second )Tj
T*(Opium War, and represents the first substantial oeuvre of photojournalism. He )Tj
T*(had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he )Tj

T*( Because of the existence of a number of photographs signed "Felice Antonio )Tj
T*(Beato" and "Felice A. Beato", it was long assumed that there was one )Tj
T*(photographer who somehow photographed at the same time in places as distant as )Tj
T*(Egypt and Japan. In 1983 it was shown by Chantal Edel[6] that "Felice Antonio )Tj
T*(Beato" represented two brothers, Felice Beato and Antonio Beato, who sometimes )Tj
T*(worked together, sharing a signature. The confusion arising from the signatures )Tj
T*(continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was )Tj
T*(the creator of a given image. )Tj
T*( [edit] Mediterranean, the Crimea and India )Tj
T*( Little is certain about Felice Beato's early development as a photographer, )Tj
T*(though it is said that he bought his first and only lens in Paris in 1851.[7] )Tj
T*(He probably met the British photographer James Robertson in Malta in 1850 and )Tj
T*(accompanied him to Constantinople in 1851. Robertson had been an engraver at )Tj
T*(the Imperial Ottoman Mint since 1843 and had probably taken up photography in )Tj
T*(the 1840s.[8] In 1853 the two began photographing together and they formed a )Tj
T*(partnership called "Robertson &amp; Beato" either in that year or in 1854, when )Tj
T*(Robertson opened a photographic studio in Pera, Constantinople. Robertson and )Tj
T*(Beato were joined by Beato's brother Antonio on photographic expeditions to )Tj
T*(Malta in 1854 or 1856 and to Greece and Jerusalem in 1857. A number of the )Tj
T*(firm's photographs produced in the 1850s are signed "Robertson, Beato and Co.", )Tj
T*(and it is believed that the "and Co." refers to Antonio.[9] )Tj
T*( In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda )Tj
T*(Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace \(b. 1856\), Edith )Tj
T*(Marcon Vergence \(b. 1859\), and Helen Beatruc \(b. 1861\).[7] )Tj
T*( In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they )Tj
T*(took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. In )Tj
T*(contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and )Tj
T*(Robertson showed the destruction.[10] They photographed the fall of Sevastopol )Tj
T*(in September 1855, producing about 60 images.[11] )Tj
T*( In February 1858 Felice Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling )Tj
T*(throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of )Tj
T*(1857.[12][note 4] During this time he produced possibly the first-ever )Tj
T*(photographic images of corpses.[14] It is believed that for at least one of his )Tj
T*(photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal )Tj
T*(remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's )Tj
T*(dramatic impact[15] \(see events at Taku Forts\). He was also in the cities of )Tj
T*(Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore.[16] Beato )Tj
T*(was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably )Tj
T*(for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, )Tj
T*(setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.[17] )Tj
T*( In 1860 Felice Beato left the partnership of Robertson &amp; Beato, though )Tj
T*(Robertson retained use of the name until 1867. Beato was sent from India to )Tj
T*(photograph the Anglo-French military expedition to China in the Second Opium )Tj
T*(War. He arrived in Hong Kong in March[18] and immediately began photographing )Tj
T*(the city and its surroundings as far as Canton.[19] Beato's photographs are )Tj
T*(some of the earliest taken in China.[20] )Tj
T*( While in Hong Kong, Beato met Charles Wirgman, an artist and correspondent for )Tj
T*(the Illustrated London News. The two accompanied the Anglo-French forces )Tj
T*(travelling north to Talien Bay, then to Pehtang and the Taku Forts at the mouth )Tj
T*(of the Peiho, and on to Peking and Qingyi Yuan, the suburban Summer Palace.[19] )Tj
T*(For places on this route and later in Japan, Wirgman's \(and others'\) )Tj
T*(illustrations for the Illustrated London News would often be derived from )Tj
T*(Beato's photographs.[note 5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Taku Forts )Tj
T*( Beato's photographs of the Second Opium War are the first to document a )Tj
T*(military campaign as it unfolded,[21] doing so through a sequence of dated and )Tj
T*(related images. His photographs of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a )Tj
T*(reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of )Tj

T*(forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers.[21] The photographs were )Tj
T*(not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken )Tj
T*(firstâ€”before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the )Tj
T*(other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.[22] )Tj
T*( Beato's images of the Chinese dead and his manner of producing them )Tj
T*(particularly reveal the ideological aspects of his photojournalism. Dr. David )Tj
T*(F. Rennie, a member of the expedition, noted in his campaign memoir, "I walked )Tj
T*(round the ramparts on the west side. They were thickly strewn with deadâ€”in the )Tj
T*(north-west angle thirteen were lying in one group around a gun. Signor Beato )Tj
T*(was here in great excitement, characterising the group as 'beautiful,' and )Tj
T*(begging that it might not be interfered with until perpetuated by his )Tj
T*(photographic apparatus, which was done a few minutes afterwards."[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Summer Palace )Tj
T*( Just outside Peking, Beato took photographs at Qingyi Yuan \(the Summer )Tj
T*(Palace\), a private estate of the Emperor of China comprising palace pavilions, )Tj
T*(temples, a large artificial lake, and gardens. Some of these photographs, taken )Tj
T*(between 6 and 18 October 1860, are unique images of buildings that were )Tj
T*(plundered and looted by the Anglo-French forces beginning on 6 October. On 18 )Tj
T*(and 19 October the buildings were torched by the British First Division on the )Tj
T*(orders of Lord Elgin as a reprisal against the emperor for the torture and )Tj
T*(deaths of twenty members of an Allied diplomatic party. Bennett writes that )Tj
T*("These [photographs] appear to be the earliest images of Peking so far )Tj
T*(discovered, and are of the utmost historical and cultural importance."[24] )Tj
T*( Among the last photographs that Beato took in China at this time were )Tj
T*(portraits of Lord Elgin, in Peking to sign the Convention of Peking, and Prince )Tj
T*(Kung, who signed on behalf of the Xianfeng Emperor.[21] )Tj
T*( Beato returned to England in October 1861, and during that winter he sold 400 )Tj
T*(of his photographs of India and China to Henry Hering, a London commercial )Tj
T*(portrait photographer.[25] )Tj
T*( By 1863 Beato had moved to Yokohama, Japan, joining Charles Wirgman, with whom )Tj
T*(he had travelled from Bombay to Hong Kong.[26] The two formed and maintained a )Tj
T*(partnership called "Beato &amp; Wirgman, Artists and Photographers" during the )Tj
T*(years 1864â€“1867,[27] one of the earliest[28] and most important[14] commercial )Tj
T*(studios in Japan. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's )Tj
T*(photographs, while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other )Tj
T*(works. \(Beato's photographs were also used for engravings within AimÃ© Humbert's )Tj
T*(Le Japon illustrÃ©[29] and other works.\) Beato's Japanese photographs include )Tj
T*(portraits, genre works, landscapes, cityscapes, and a series of photographs )Tj
T*(documenting the scenery and sites along the TÅkaidÅ Road, the latter series )Tj
T*(recalling the ukiyo-e of Hiroshige and Hokusai. During this period, foreign )Tj
T*(access to \(and within\) the country was greatly restricted by the Shogunate. )Tj
T*(Accompanying ambassadorial delegations[30] and taking any other opportunities )Tj
T*(created by his personal popularity and close relationship with the British )Tj
T*(military, Beato reached areas of Japan where few westerners had ventured, and )Tj
T*(in addition to conventionally pleasing subjects sought sensational and macabre )Tj
T*(subject matter such as heads on display after decapitation.[31] His images are )Tj
T*(remarkable not only for their quality, but also for their rarity as )Tj
T*(photographic views of Edo period Japan.[32] )Tj
T*( The greater part of Beato's work in Japan contrasted strongly with his earlier )Tj
T*(work in India and China, which "had underlined and even celebrated conflict and )Tj
T*(the triumph of British imperial might".[33] Aside from the Portrait of Prince )Tj
T*(Kung, any appearances of Chinese people in Beato's earlier work had been )Tj
T*(peripheral \(minor, blurred, or both\) or as corpses. With the exception of his )Tj
T*(work in September 1864 as an official photographer on the British military )Tj
T*(expedition to Shimonoseki,[26] Beato was eager to portray Japanese people, and )Tj
T*(did so uncondescendingly, even showing them as defiant in the face of the )Tj
T*(elevated status of westerners.[34] )Tj
T*( Beato was very active while in Japan. In 1865 he produced a number of dated )Tj
T*(views of Nagasaki and its surroundings.[26] From 1866 he was often caricatured )Tj
T*(in Japan Punch, which was founded and edited by Wirgman.[35] In an October 1866 )Tj

T*( Although Beato was not the first photographer in Japan to sell albums of his )Tj
T*(works, he was probably the first to recognise their full commercial )Tj
T*(potential,[36] and by around 1870 their sale had become the mainstay of his )Tj
T*(business.[37] Although the customer would select the content of earlier albums, )Tj
T*(Beato moved toward albums of his own selection. It was probably Beato who )Tj

T*(containing 100 portraits and genre works, and "Views of Japan", containing 98 )Tj
T*(landscapes and cityscapes.[39] )Tj
T*( Many of the photographs in Beato's albums were hand-coloured, a technique that )Tj
T*(in his studio successfully applied the refined skills of Japanese )Tj
T*(watercolourists and woodblock printmakers to European photography.[32] )Tj
T*( Since about the time of the ending of his partnership with Wirgman in 1869, )Tj
T*(Beato attempted to retire from the work of a photographer, instead attempting )Tj
T*(other ventures[1][32] and delegating photographic work to others within his own )Tj
T*(studio in Yokohama, "F. Beato &amp; Co., Photographers",[40] which he ran with )Tj
T*(an assistant named H. Woollett and four Japanese photographers and four )Tj
T*(Japanese artists.[41]Kusakabe Kimbei was probably one of Beato's )Tj
T*(artist-assistants before becoming a photographer in his own right.[42] But )Tj
T*(these other ventures would fail, and Beato's photographic skills and personal )Tj
T*(popularity would ensure that he could successfully return to work as a )Tj
T*(photographer.[1] )Tj
T*( Beato photographed with Ueno Hikoma,[43] and possibly taught photography to )Tj
T*(Raimund von Stillfried.[44] )Tj
T*( In 1871 Beato served as official photographer with the United States naval )Tj
T*(expedition of Admiral Rodgers to Korea.[35] Although it is possible that an )Tj
T*(unidentified Frenchman photographed Korea during the 1866 invasion of Ganghwa )Tj
T*(Island,[45] Beato's photographs are the earliest of Korea whose provenance is )Tj
T*(clear.[46] )Tj
T*( Beato's business ventures in Japan were numerous. He owned land[47] and )Tj
T*(several studios, was a property consultant, had a financial interest in the )Tj
T*(Grand Hotel of Yokohama,[35] and was a dealer in imported carpets and women's )Tj
T*(bags, among other things. He also appeared in court on several occasions, )Tj
T*(variously as plaintiff, defendant, and witness.[48] On 6 August 1873 Beato was )Tj
T*(appointed Consul General for Greece in Japan.[41] )Tj
T*( In 1877 Beato sold most of his stock to the firm Stillfried &amp; )Tj
T*(Andersen,[32] who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried &amp; )Tj
T*(Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885.[49] Following the sale to )Tj
T*(Stillfried &amp; Andersen, Beato apparently retired for some years from )Tj
T*(photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and )Tj
T*(trader.[50] On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in Port Said, )Tj
T*(Egypt.[51] It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his )Tj
T*(money on the Yokohama silver exchange.[52] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later years )Tj
T*( From 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary )Tj
T*(forces led by Baron \(later Viscount\) G.J. Wolseley to Khartoum, Sudan, in )Tj
T*(relief of General Charles Gordon.[52] )Tj
T*( Briefly back in England in 1886, Beato lectured the London and Provincial )Tj
T*(Photographic Society on photographic techniques.[52] By 1888 he was )Tj
T*(photographing in Asia again, this time in Burma,[53] where from 1896 he )Tj
T*(operated a photographic studio \(called "The Photographic Studio"\) as well as a )Tj
T*(furniture and curio business in Mandalay, with a branch office in Rangoon.[54] )Tj
T*(In 1899 he left F.Â Beato Ltd \(which would go into liquidation in 1907\),[55] but )Tj
T*(he worked in "The Photographic Studio" until 1904 and may have continued work )Tj
T*(under his own or another name after that.[55] Although Beato was previously )Tj
T*(believed to have died in Rangoon or Mandalay in 1905 or 1906,[56] his death )Tj
T*(certificate, discovered in 2009, indicates that he died on 29 January 1909 in )Tj

T*( Whether acknowledged as his own work, sold as Stillfried &amp; Andersen's, or )Tj
T*(encountered as anonymous engravings, Beato's work had a major impact: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(For over fifty years into the early twentieth century, Beato's photographs of )Tj

T*(notions of several Asian societies.[57])Tj

T*( [edit] Photographic techniques )Tj
T*( Photographs of the 19th century often now show the limitations of the )Tj
T*(technology used, yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even )Tj
T*(transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced albumen silver prints )Tj
T*(from wet collodion glass-plate negatives.[58] )Tj
T*( Beato pioneered and refined the techniques of hand-colouring photographs[30] )Tj
T*(and making panoramas.[59] He may have started hand-colouring photographs at the )Tj
T*(suggestion of Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made )Tj
T*(by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew.[60] Whatever the )Tj
T*(inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his )Tj
T*(coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised )Tj
T*(as excellent.[note 6] As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to )Tj
T*(represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. )Tj
T*(Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which )Tj
T*(he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and )Tj
T*(then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive )Tj
T*(view.[62] The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven )Tj
T*(photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 )Tj
T*(metres \(6 1/2Â ft\).[62] )Tj

T*( ^ It appears that Felice was his original name. However, he tended to prefer )Tj
T*(Felix.[1] During his lifetime he was often referred to in print as "Signor )Tj
T*(Beato", and his surname was often misspelled \("Beat", "Beatto", etc\).[2])Tj
T*(^ Recent scholarship had uncovered an application by Beato for a travel permit )Tj
T*(in 1858 that included information suggesting he was born in 1833 or 1834 on the )Tj
T*(island of Corfu.[4] Earlier sources had given his birth date as 1825 or ca. )Tj
T*(1825, but these dates may have been confused references to the possible birth )Tj
T*(date of his brother, Antonio. However, the death certificate discovered in 2009 )Tj
T*(provides the first definitive evidence of Beato's dates and places of birth and )Tj
T*(death.)Tj
T*(^ Beato has long been described as British, Italian, Corfiot Italian, and/or )Tj
T*(Greek. The movements of his family and of early nineteenth century history in )Tj
T*(the Adriatic mean that he can justifiably be described by all these terms. )Tj
T*(Corfu was on and off part of Venetian territory from 1386 until 1815, when the )Tj
T*(Treaty of Paris placed it and the other Ionian Islands under British )Tj
T*(protection. Corfu was ceded to Greece in 1864. A line of the Beato family is )Tj
T*(recorded as having moved to Corfu in the 17th century and was one of the noble )Tj
T*(Venetian families that ruled the island during the Republic of Venice.[5])Tj
T*(^ Gernsheim states that Beato and Robertson both travelled to India in 1857, )Tj
T*(but it is now generally accepted that Beato travelled there alone.[13])Tj

T*( Larrys Creek is a 22.9-mile-long \(36.9Â km\)[6]tributary of the West Branch )Tj
T*(Susquehanna River in Lycoming County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. A part )Tj
T*(of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, its watershed drains 89.1 square miles )Tj
T*(\(231Â km2\) in six townships and a borough. The creek flows south from the )Tj

T*(Pennsylvanian periods. )Tj
T*( The valley's first recorded inhabitants were the Susquehannocks, followed by )Tj
T*(the Lenape and other tribes.[7] The Great Shamokin Path crossed the creek near )Tj
T*(its mouth, where Larry Burt, the first Euro-American settler and the man who )Tj
T*(gave the creek its present name, also lived by 1769. In the 19th century, the )Tj
T*(creek and its watershed were a center for logging and related industries, )Tj

T*(1903 newspaper article claimed "No other stream in the country had so many )Tj
T*(mills in so small a territory".[8] For transportation, a plank road ran along )Tj
T*(much of the creek for decades, and two "paper railroads" were planned, but )Tj

T*(period region within this area.[24] The Cogan House anticline runs north of and )Tj
T*(parallel to the upper part of the creek.[25] Iron ore within the watershed was )Tj
T*(mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century; there are )Tj
T*(also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain.[26] )Tj
T*( Larrys Creek is in a narrow valley formed by mountains and hills, with steep )Tj

T*(the northern edge of Green Mountain, turns south into the State Game Lands at )Tj
T*(Buckhorn Mountain, and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain. The )Tj
T*(only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris Point, where )Tj
T*(it leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau.[27] )Tj
T*( The Second Fork flows south along the eastern side of Henson Ridge, then east )Tj
T*(of Puterbaugh Mountain. The only named peak on the east bank of the Second Fork )Tj

T*( Two Clovis points found in the Salladasburg area in a "stream site" are the )Tj
T*(earliest evidence of human activity along Larrys Creek \(circa 10,000 BCE\).[57] )Tj
T*(The earliest recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the )Tj
T*(Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant "people of the muddy river" )Tj
T*(in Algonquian. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved )Tj
T*(away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The )Tj
T*(lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley were then chiefly occupied by )Tj
T*(the Munsee phratry of the Lenape \(or Delaware\), and were under the nominal )Tj
T*(control of the Five \(later Six\) Nations of the Iroquois. The Great Shamokin )Tj
T*(Path crossed the creek at a ford near its mouth; however, no trails of the )Tj
T*(indigenous peoples are recorded as having followed Larrys Creek north.[58] )Tj
T*( On November 5, 1768, the British acquired the "New Purchase" from the Iroquois )Tj
T*(in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, opening what is now Lycoming County to )Tj
T*(settlement. However, the Line of Property \(or Purchase Line\) border defined by )Tj
T*("Tiadaghton Creek" dividing colonial and Native American lands was disputed. )Tj
T*(The colonists claimed this was Pine Creek, the Iroquois and other tribes that )Tj
T*(it was Lycoming Creek. Larrys Creek was in the disputed territory between )Tj

T*(rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at )Tj
T*(Williamsport \(as they were on Pine Creek to the west\).[26] )Tj
T*( This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development )Tj
T*(of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within )Tj
T*(22 miles \(35Â km\) of the mouth \(as well as other industries of the time\). No )Tj
T*(other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. )Tj
T*(Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on )Tj
T*(Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were )Tj
T*(structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam )Tj
T*(powered \(the rest were water powered\). The earliest of these sawmills was built )Tj
T*(in 1796 \(near Seeley Run\), the last in 1902 \(on Lawshe Run\), and by 1903 just )Tj
T*(two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.[8] )Tj
T*( Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, )Tj
T*(and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages )Tj
T*(of Carter and Gould, 6 miles \(9.7Â km\) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in )Tj
T*(Mifflin Township.[26] There are large tracts of second growth forest and small )Tj
T*(lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.[62] )Tj
T*( [edit] Paper railroads )Tj
T*( Two "paper railroads" were proposed for Larrys Creek: the "Larry's Creek )Tj
T*(Railroad and Coal Company", incorporated June 24, 1839 to hold 2,000 acres \(8.1Â )Tj
T*(km2\) and operate up to 7 miles \(11Â km\) of railroad from the mouth of the creek )Tj
T*(north to the coal mines; and the "Jersey Shore, Pine Creek &amp; State Line )Tj
T*(Railroad", incorporated on April 11, 1853 to run north from Jersey Shore up )Tj
T*(Pine Creek to Tioga or Long Run, and thence to the New York state line. Its )Tj
T*(charter was amended April 4, 1854 to run up Marsh Creek \(then known as the )Tj
T*(Third Fork Pine Creek\) and Crooked Creek to the Tioga Railroad, and again on )Tj
T*(March 26, 1856 to run up Little Pine Creek \(then known as First Fork Pine )Tj
T*(Creek\) to the Larrys Creek Plank Road and then up Blockhouse Creek to )Tj
T*(Blossburg. It was still an active corporation in 1865, but the charter of the )Tj
T*("Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway" in 1870 \(New York City-Reading )Tj
T*(interests\) superseded it. Neither railroad was actually ever built.[63] The )Tj
T*(only railroad in the watershed crosses the creek just north of the mouth. )Tj
T*( [edit] Plank road )Tj
T*( In 1851 a plank road or puncheon was built along Larrys Creek from the village )Tj
T*(of Larrys Creek at the creek's mouth north to Salladasburg, then later along )Tj
T*(the Second Fork and on to the village of Brookside in Cogan House Township. It )Tj
T*(was later extended north to the village of White Pine and finally to the )Tj
T*(village of English Center in Pine Township \(along the current course of )Tj
T*(Pennsylvania Route 287\). A spur of the plank road along Larrys Creek into )Tj
T*(Anthony Township was also built, but it is not known how far it extended.[64] )Tj

T*(\(Landis claims it may have run nearly as far north as the covered bridge in )Tj
T*(Cogan House Township\).[65] The plank road was a toll road run by "The Larrys )Tj
T*(Creek Plank Road Company", a corporation founded May 8, 1850. It served the )Tj
T*(sawmills, grist mills, mines, and leather tanneries along the creek. There was )Tj
T*(a connection to the railroad and the West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania )Tj
T*(Canal at the hamlet of Larrys Creek, as well as the West Branch Susquehanna )Tj
T*(River. )Tj
T*( Hemlock logs were used to build the plank road. At that time, the tree's bark )Tj
T*(was a major source of tannin used to tan leather. The wood was not used much )Tj
T*(for lumber, so hundreds of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally )Tj
T*(left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from )Tj
T*(the local timber industry. )Tj
T*( The earth under the plank road was first graded, then ties \(similar to those )Tj
T*(used for railroad tracks\) were set into the ground. Next long narrow stringers )Tj
T*(\(similar to rails on a railroad track\) were nailed to the ties, with a distance )Tj
T*(between stringers of about 6 feet \(1.8Â m\). The road surface consisted of planks )Tj
T*(about 8 feet \(2.4Â m\) wide nailed to the stringers and was fairly smooth. The )Tj
T*(road had turnoffs \(as it was not wide enough for horse drawn vehicles to pass )Tj
T*(each other\). Toll houses were at regular intervals, with variable tolls for )Tj
T*(pedestrians, riders on horseback and various carts and wagons. No toll schedule )Tj
T*(has survived. )Tj
T*( The plank road was operational for about 38 years when a major flood on June )Tj
T*(1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the )Tj
T*(creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed )Tj
T*(over 2200 people.[61] The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys )Tj
T*(Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just )Tj
T*(upstream.[65] The 90Â foot \(27Â m\) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, )Tj
T*(listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in )Tj
T*(1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.[66][67] )Tj
T*( By then most of the original forests in the county had been clear-cut, so no )Tj
T*(cheap source of wood was available as before. While the road from Salladasburg )Tj
T*(south to the West Branch Susquehanna River was repaired and rebuilt, the rest )Tj
T*(was not. In 1900 the county courts recognized a petition to end tolls on this )Tj
T*(last portion of the road. The corporation was dissolved and the road and its )Tj
T*(maintenance passed to the county. As sections of plank road wore out they were )Tj
T*(replaced by graded dirt and gravel, so that it soon became a regular road. The )Tj
T*(plank road operated as a toll road for about 49 years.[64] Today only the )Tj
T*("Plank Road" name survives, in a 0.6 miles \(0.97Â km\) section of road that runs )Tj
T*(north from U.S. Route 220, parallel to Route 287.[3] )Tj

T*(she supported. )Tj
T*( In 1948, feeling threatened by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga emigrated with her )Tj
T*(immediate family to a farm in Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her )Tj
T*(husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died )Tj
T*(there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with )Tj
T*(devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven )Tj
T*(months after her older sister, Xenia. At the end of her life and afterwards, )Tj
T*(Olga was widely labeled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Olga was the youngest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his consort, Marie )Tj
T*(Feodorovna, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was born in the purple, )Tj
T*(i.e. during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace, west of )Tj
T*(Saint Petersburg. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from )Tj
T*(the ramparts of the Peter and Paul Fortress, and similar salutes throughout the )Tj
T*(Russian Empire.[1] Her mother, advised by her sister, Alexandra, Princess of )Tj
T*(Wales, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.[1] )Tj
T*( The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety )Tj
T*(reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about )Tj
T*(50Â miles \(80Â km\) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were )Tj
T*(not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were )Tj
T*(modest, even Spartan.[2] They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in )Tj
T*(cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.[2] )Tj
T*( Olga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the )Tj
T*(imperial family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train )Tj
T*(approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four )Tj
T*(older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched )Tj
T*(violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron )Tj
T*(roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar )Tj
T*(crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with "a Herculean )Tj
T*(effort" so that the others could escape.[3] There were 21 fatalities. Empress )Tj
T*(Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own )Tj
T*(clothes.[4] An official investigation found that the crash was an accident,[5] )Tj
T*(but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.[4] )Tj
T*( The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. )Tj
T*(Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as )Tj
T*(drawing and dancing.[6] Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught )Tj
T*(at an early age, and they became expert riders.[7] The family was deeply )Tj
T*(religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and )Tj
T*(extravagance, Lent was strictly observedâ€”meat, dairy products and any form of )Tj
T*(entertainment were avoided.[8] Family holidays were taken in the summer at )Tj
T*(Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.[9] )Tj
T*( Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their )Tj
T*(relationship remained a difficult one.[10] However, Olga, her father, and the )Tj
T*(youngest of her brothers, Michael, had a close relationship. Together, the )Tj
T*(three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar )Tj
T*(taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.[11] Olga said of her father: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(My father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared )Tj
T*(that daily half-hour.Â â€¦ once my father showed me a very old album full of most )Tj
T*(exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited )Tj
T*(by Mopses [pug dogs]. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have )Tj
T*(him share his own childhood secrets with me.[12])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( During 1894 Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to )Tj
T*(Denmark was cancelled.[13] On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The )Tj
T*(emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic,[14] and her eldest )Tj
T*(brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which in )Tj
T*(Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.[15] )Tj

T*( Olga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899, but after the death of )Tj
T*(her brother George at the age of 27, her first official public appearance was )Tj
T*(delayed by a year until 1900.[16] She hated the experience, and later told her )Tj
T*(official biographer Ian Vorres, "I felt as though I were an animal in a )Tj
T*(cageâ€”exhibited to the public for the first time."[17] From 1901, Olga was )Tj
T*(appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of )Tj
T*(the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory )Tj
T*(over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive )Tj
T*(brown dolman.[18] )Tj
T*( By 1900 Olga, age 18, was being escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant )Tj
T*(cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian branch )Tj
T*(of the House of Oldenburg.[19] He was 14 years her senior and known for his )Tj
T*(passion for literature and gambling.[20] Peter asked for Olga's hand in )Tj
T*(marriage the following year, a proposal that took the grand duchess completely )Tj
T*(by surprise: "I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you'," she )Tj
T*(later explained. [21] )Tj
T*( Their engagement, announced in May 1901, was unexpected by family and friends, )Tj
T*(as Peter had shown no prior interest in women,[17] and members of society )Tj
T*(assumed he was homosexual.[22] At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married )Tj
T*(33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg )Tj
T*(palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while )Tj
T*(her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning.[23] Their )Tj
T*(marriage remained unconsummated,[24] and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed )Tj
T*(into proposing by his ambitious mother.[25] Biographer Patricia Phenix thought )Tj
T*(Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, )Tj
T*(the Dowager Empress Marie, or avoid marriage into a foreign court.[26] The )Tj
T*(couple initially lived with her in laws Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg )Tj
T*(and EugÃ©nie Maximilianovna of Leuchtenberg. It was not an harmonious )Tj
T*(arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, )Tj
T*(berated their only son for his laziness.[23] EugÃ©nie, a close friend of Empress )Tj
T*(Marie, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had )Tj
T*(been a present to JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a )Tj
T*(dislike towards her mother in law.[23] A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and )Tj
T*(her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, where they boarded a yacht loaned to )Tj
T*(them by King Edward VII of Great Britain and sailed to Sorrento, Italy.[27] )Tj
T*( On their return to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace \(the former )Tj
T*(Baryatinsky mansion\) at 46 Sergievskaya Street \(today Tchaikovskogo Street\), )Tj
T*(Saint Petersburg.[28] The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, )Tj
T*(now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The grand )Tj
T*(duchess had her own studio to draw, but in their large palace, Olga and Peter )Tj
T*(had separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the building.[29] Unhappy in her )Tj
T*(marriage, Olga fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, )Tj
T*(forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.[30] )Tj
T*( Near the Oldenburg's estate, Ramon in Voronezh province, Olga had her own )Tj
T*(villa, called "Olgino" after the local town.[31] She subsidized the village )Tj
T*(school out of her own pocket, and established a hospital.[32] Her )Tj
T*(daughter-in-law later wrote, "She tried to help every needy person as far as )Tj
T*(her strengths and means would permit."[32] At the hospital, she learned basic )Tj
T*(medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor.[33] She exemplified )Tj
T*(her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to )Tj
T*(the charitable endeavours she supported.[32] At Ramon Olga and Peter enjoyed )Tj
T*(walking through the nearby woods and hunted wolves together.[34] He was kind )Tj
T*(and considerate towards her, but she longed for love, a normal marriage and )Tj
T*(children.[35] )Tj
T*( In April 1903, she was introduced to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai )Tj
T*(Kulikovsky by her brother Michael during a royal military review at Pavlovsk )Tj
T*(Palace.[36] Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters )Tj
T*(regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and )Tj
T*(asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might )Tj
T*(reconsider after seven years.[37] Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky )Tj

T*(as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg )Tj
T*(and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya street.[38] The relationship between )Tj
T*(Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public,[39] but gossip about their )Tj
T*(romance spread through society.[40] )Tj
T*( From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was appointed to a military post in Tsarskoye )Tj
T*(Selo, a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, )Tj
T*(the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived )Tj
T*(at the Alexander Palace near her own residence.[41] Olga prized her connection )Tj
T*(to the Tsar's four daughters.[42] From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to )Tj
T*(parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every )Tj
T*(weekend throughout the winter.[42] She especially took a liking to the youngest )Tj
T*(of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called Shvipsik )Tj
T*(\("little one"\).[43] Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a )Tj
T*(self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no )Tj
T*(public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was )Tj
T*(unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him.[44] As Olga grew )Tj
T*(close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving )Tj
T*(brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped )Tj
T*(with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael )Tj
T*(and the rest of the family was essentially cut off.[45] )Tj
T*( Public unrest over the Russo-Japanese War and demands for political reform )Tj
T*(increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At Epiphany 1905, a band )Tj
T*(of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the Winter Palace from the Peter and )Tj
T*(Paul Fortress. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters )Tj
T*(from a smashed window, but were unharmed.[46] Three weeks later, on "Bloody )Tj
T*(Sunday", at least 92 people were killed by Cossack troops during a )Tj
T*(demonstration,[47] and a month later Olga's uncle, Grand Duke Sergei )Tj
T*(Alexandrovich of Russia, was assassinated.[48] Uprisings occurred throughout )Tj
T*(the country, and parts of the navy mutinied.[49] Olga supported the appointment )Tj
T*(of the liberal Pyotr Stolypin as prime minister, and he embarked on a programme )Tj
T*(of gradual reform, but in 1911 he was assassinated.[50] The public unrest, )Tj
T*(Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in )Tj
T*(1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous )Tj
T*(breakdown.[51]Tsarina Alexandra was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the )Tj
T*(poor health of her hemophiliac son, Alexei.[52] Olga stood in for the Tsarina )Tj
T*(at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while )Tj
T*(the Tsarina remained at home.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] War and revolution )Tj
T*( On 1 August 1914, just before the start of World War I, Olga's regiment, the )Tj
T*(Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at )Tj
T*(Krasnoe Selo.[54] Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were )Tj
T*(stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia.[18] With the Grand )Tj
T*(Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work )Tj
T*(as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno, near to where her )Tj
T*(own regiment was stationed.[55] During the war, she came under heavy Austrian )Tj
T*(fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close )Tj
T*(to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by )Tj
T*(General Mannerheim, who later became President of Finland.[18] As the Russians )Tj
T*(lost ground to the Central Powers, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to )Tj
T*(Kiev,[56] and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.[57] )Tj
T*( In 1916, Tsar Nicholas II officially annulled the marriage between Duke Peter )Tj
T*(Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel )Tj
T*(Kulikovsky.[58] The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the )Tj
T*(Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya \(Three Saints Street\) in )Tj
T*(Kiev. The only guests were the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law )Tj
T*(Grand Duke Alexander, four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of )Tj
T*(Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.[59] )Tj
T*( During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued )Tj

T*(from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces.[61] )Tj
T*(On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during )Tj

T*(younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner. )Tj
T*( The Romanovs isolated in the Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and )Tj

T*(most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, )Tj
T*(where Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter were already under house arrest. Olga and )Tj

T*(March 1918, the Central Power of Germany had advanced on the Crimea, and the )Tj
T*(revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.[63] In November 1918, the )Tj
T*(German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they )Tj
T*(evacuated homewards. Allied forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of )Tj
T*(the loyalist White Army, which temporarily allowed the surviving members of the )Tj
T*(Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress Marie and, at her )Tj
T*(insistence, most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British )Tj
T*(warship HMS Marlborough. Nicholas II, however, had already been assassinated )Tj
T*(and the family assumed, correctly, that his wife and children had also been )Tj
T*(killed.[64] Unknown to her, Olga's childhood confidant and brother Michael, the )Tj
T*(emperor's supposed successor, had been assassinated near Perm on 13 June 1918. )Tj
T*( Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia, and decided to move to the )Tj
T*(Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks.[65] An )Tj
T*(imperial bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large )Tj
T*(Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-roomed farmhouse there, Olga )Tj
T*(gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919.[66] He was )Tj
T*(named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the )Tj
T*(Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on )Tj
T*(what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary )Tj
T*(troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the )Tj
T*(Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe )Tj
T*(arrival in Denmark.[67] After a brief stay with the consul, the family were )Tj
T*(shipped to a refugee camp on the island of BÃ¼yÃ¼kada in the Dardanelles Strait )Tj
T*(near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms )Tj
T*(with eleven other adults.[68] After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade )Tj
T*(in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent )Tj
T*(Alexander Karageorgevich, later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Alexander )Tj
T*(offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was )Tj
T*(summoned to Denmark by her mother.[67] On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family )Tj
T*(arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress Marie, at first at )Tj
T*(the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of HvidÃ¸re, where Olga )Tj
T*(acted as her mother's secretary and companion.[69] It was a difficult )Tj
T*(arrangement at times. The dowager empress insisted on having Olga at her beck )Tj
T*(and call. Never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a )Tj
T*(commoner, Marie was cold towards Kulikovsky rarely allowing him in her )Tj
T*(presence.[70]At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother )Tj
T*(alone. The empress also found Olga's young sons too boisterous.[70] )Tj

T*("probably the only indisputable fact in the whole story".[71] Anderson claimed )Tj
T*(that with the help of a man named Tchaikovsky she had escaped from )Tj
T*(revolutionary Russia via Bucharest, where she had given birth to his child. )Tj
T*(Olga thought the story "palpably false",[72] since Anderson made no attempt to )Tj
T*(approach Queen Marie of Romania, during her entire alleged time in Bucharest. )Tj
T*(Olga said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(If Mrs. Anderson had indeed been Anastasia, Queen Marie would have recognized )Tj
T*(her on the spot.Â ... Marie would never have been shocked at anything, and a )Tj
T*(niece of mine would have known it.Â ... There is not one tittle of genuine )Tj
T*(evidence in the story. The woman keeps away from the one relative who would )Tj
T*(have been the first to recognize her, understand her desperate plight, and )Tj
T*(symphathize with her.[72])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform Princess Irene of Prussia \(sister )Tj
T*(of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II\) of her survival. Olga )Tj
T*(commented, "[Princess Irene] was one of the most straightlaced women in her )Tj
T*(generation. My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have )Tj
T*(shocked [her]."[72] )Tj
T*( Olga met Anderson, who was being treated for tuberculosis, at a nursing home. )Tj
T*(Of the visit Olga later said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(My beloved Anastasia was fifteen when I saw her for the last time in the summer )Tj
T*(of 1916. She would have been twenty-four in 1925. I thought Mrs. Anderson )Tj
T*(looked much older than that. Of course, one had to make allowances for a very )Tj
T*(long illnessÂ ... All the same, my niece's features could not possibly have )Tj
T*(altered out of all recognition. The nose, the mouth, the eyes were all )Tj
T*(different.[73]Â ... As soon as I sat down by that bed in the Mommsen Nursing )Tj
T*(Home, I knew I was looking at a stranger.Â â€¦ I had left Denmark with something )Tj
T*(of a hope in my heart. I left Berlin with all hope extinguished.[74])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In addition, Olga said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and )Tj
T*(showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian, while Anastasia spoke both )Tj
T*(those languages fluently and was ignorant of German.[75] Nevertheless, Olga )Tj
T*(remained sympathetic towards Anderson, perhaps because she thought that she was )Tj
T*(ill rather than deliberately deceitful.[76] Olga later explained: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(...Â she did not strike me as an out-and-out impostor. Her brusqueness warred )Tj
T*(against it. A cunning impostor would have done all she could to ingratiate )Tj
T*(herselfÂ ... But Mrs. Anderson's manner would have put anyone off. My own )Tj
T*(conviction is that it all started with some unscrupulous people who hoped they )Tj
T*(might lay their hands on at least a share of the fabulous and utterly )Tj
T*(non-existent Romanov fortuneÂ ... I had a feeling she was 'briefed,' as it were, )Tj
T*(but far from perfectly. The mistakes she made could not all be attributed to )Tj
T*(lapses of memory. For instance, she had a scar on one of her fingers and she )Tj
T*(kept telling everybody that it had been crushed because of a footman shutting )Tj
T*(the door of a landau too quickly. And at once I remembered the real incident. )Tj
T*(It was Marie, her elder sister, who got her hand hurt rather badly, and it did )Tj
T*(not happen in a carriage but on board the imperial train. Obviously someone, )Tj
T*(having heard something of the incident, had passed a garbled version of it to )Tj
T*(Mrs. Anderson.[74])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Conceivably, Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson )Tj
T*(was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind.[77] Anderson's biographer and )Tj
T*(supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf )Tj
T*(Zahle, at the end of October 1925: "My feeling is that she is not the one she )Tj
T*(believesâ€”but one can't say she is not as a fact".[78] However, within a month )Tj
T*(she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, "There is no resemblance, and )Tj
T*(she is undoubtedly not A."[79][80] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, )Tj
T*(which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson )Tj

T*(as Anastasia.[81] Olga later said she sent the gift and letters "out of )Tj
T*(pity",[82] and called the claims "a complete fabrication".[82] When Olga )Tj
T*(refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement )Tj
T*(denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper,[83] Anderson's supporters, )Tj
T*(Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on )Tj
T*(instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in )Tj
T*(private letters and sworn testimony.[84][85] She told her official biographer, )Tj
T*("I never received any such telegram."[82] The supposed telegram was never )Tj
T*(produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the )Tj
T*(papers relating to the case.[86] Xenia said, )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*([Anderson's supporters] told the most terrible lies about my sister and meÂ ... )Tj
T*(I was supposed to have sent Olga a telegram saying, 'On no account recognize )Tj
T*(Anastasia.' That was a fantasy. I never sent any telegrams, or gave my sister )Tj
T*(any advice about her visit to Berlin. We were all apprehensive about the wisdom )Tj
T*(of her going, but only because we feared it would be used for propaganda )Tj
T*(purposes by the claimant's supporters.Â ... My sister Olga felt sorry for that )Tj

T*(opinions and motives have been misrepresented.[87])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Danish residency and exodus )Tj
T*( The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at HvidÃ¸re. Her estate was sold )Tj
T*(and Olga purchased Knudsminde, a farm in Ballerup about 15Â miles \(24Â km\) from )Tj
T*(Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds.[88] They kept horses, in which )Tj
T*(Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, )Tj
T*(chickens, geese, dogs and cats.[89] For transport they had a small car and a )Tj
T*(sledge.[89] Tihon and Guri \(age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they )Tj
T*(moved to Knudsminde\) grew up on the farm. Olga ran the household with the help )Tj
T*(of her elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso \("Mimka"\), who had come along )Tj
T*(with her from Russia. The grand duchess lived with simplicity working in the )Tj
T*(fields, doing household chores and painting.&lt;refname=H58/&gt; )Tj
T*( Her farm-estate became a center for the Russian monarchist community in )Tj
T*(Denmark and many Russian emigrants visited.[90] She maintained a high level of )Tj
T*(correspondence with the Russian Ã©migrÃ© community and former members of the )Tj
T*(Russian imperial army.[67] In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at )Tj
T*(Sofiero Castle, Sweden, with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife, )Tj
T*(Louise.[91] Olga began to sell her own paintings of Russian and Danish scenes, )Tj
T*(with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the )Tj
T*(proceeds were donated to the charities she supported.[67] )Tj
T*( Neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, and was occupied )Tj
T*(for the remainder of World War II. Food shortages, communication restrictions, )Tj
T*(and transportation closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served )Tj
T*(as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but )Tj
T*(their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months.[92] )Tj
T*(Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on )Tj
T*(charges of espionage.[93] Other Russian Ã©migrÃ©s, keen to fight against the )Tj
T*(Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her )Tj
T*(mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with )Tj
T*(German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian Ã©migrÃ©s )Tj
T*(fighting against communism.[94] On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark )Tj
T*(surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian )Tj
T*(exiles failed to improve, General Pyotr Krasnov wrote to the Grand Duchess, )Tj
T*(detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark.[95] )Tj
T*(She in turn asked Prince Axel of Denmark to help them, but her request was )Tj
T*(refused.[96] )Tj
T*( The Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish )Tj

T*( [edit] Emigration to Canada )Tj
T*( In May 1948, the Kulikovskys traveled to London by Danish troopship. They were )Tj
T*(housed in a grace and favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace while )Tj
T*(arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural )Tj
T*(immigrants.[100] On 2 June 1948, Olga, Kulikovsky, Tikhon and his Danish-born )Tj
T*(wife Agnete, Guli and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guli and Ruth's two children, )Tj
T*(Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's devoted companion and former maid Emilia Tenso )Tj
T*(\("Mimka"\) departed Liverpool on board the Empress of Canada.[101] After a rough )Tj
T*(crossing, the ship docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia.[102] The family proceeded to )Tj
T*(Toronto, where they lived until they purchased a 200-acre \(0.81Â km2\) farm in )Tj
T*(Halton County, Ontario, near Campbellville.[103] )Tj
T*( By 1952, the farm had become a burden to Olga and her husband. They were both )Tj
T*(elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was hard to come by; the Colonel )Tj
T*(suffered increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was )Tj
T*(stolen.[104] The farm was sold, and Olga, her husband and her former maid, )Tj
T*(Mimka, moved to a smaller 5-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, )Tj
T*(Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga.[105] )Tj
T*(Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until )Tj
T*(Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.[106] )Tj
T*( Neighbors and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, )Tj
T*(took interest in Olga, and visited her small home, which was also a magnet for )Tj
T*(Romanov impostors whom Olga and her family considered a menace.[107] Welcome )Tj
T*(visitors included Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, in 1954,[108] and Louis )Tj
T*(Mountbatten and his wife Edwina, in August 1959.[109] In June 1959, Queen )Tj
T*(Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess )Tj
T*(for lunch on board the Royal Yacht, Britannia.[110] )Tj
T*( By 1958, Olga's husband was virtually paralyzed, and Olga sold some of her )Tj
T*(remaining jewelry in an attempt to raise funds.[111] Following her husband's )Tj
T*(death in 1958, she became increasingly infirm until hospitalized in April 1960 )Tj
T*(at Toronto General Hospital.[112] She was not informed[113] or was not )Tj
T*(aware[114] that her elder sister, Xenia, died in London that month. Unable to )Tj
T*(care for herself, Olga went to stay with Russian Ã©migrÃ© friends, Konstantin and )Tj
T*(Sinaida Martemianoff, in an apartment above a beauty salon in Gerrard Street )Tj
T*(East, Toronto.[115] On 21 November 1960, she slipped into a coma, and she died )Tj
T*(on 24 November, at the age of 78.[116] )Tj
T*( She was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto, on 30 November )Tj
T*(1960, after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, Toronto. )Tj
T*(Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the )Tj
T*(small Russian church, which overflowed with mourners.[117] Although she lived )Tj
T*(simply, bought cheap clothes, and did her own shopping and gardening, her )Tj
T*(estate was valued at more than 200,000 Canadian dollars \(about 1.5 million )Tj
T*(Canadian dollars as of 2010[118]\) and was mostly held as stock and bonds.[119] )Tj
T*(Her material possessions were appraised at 350 Canadian dollars in total, which )Tj

T*(in front of the building is closed off to all automobile traffic, and is now a )Tj
T*(patrolled pedestrian zone due to its near proximity to the Presidential )Tj
T*(Administration building. )Tj
T*( Architect Vladislav Gorodetsky originally constructed the House with Chimaeras )Tj
T*(for use as his own upmarket apartment building during the period of 1901â€“1902. )Tj
T*(However, as the years went by, Gorodetsky eventually had to sell the building )Tj
T*(due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times )Tj
T*(before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until )Tj
T*(the early 2000s.[3] When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior )Tj
T*(decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Gorodetsky's original )Tj
T*(plans.[4] )Tj
T*( The building derives its popular name from the ornate decorations depicting )Tj
T*(exotic animals and hunting scenes, which were sculpted by Italian architect )Tj
T*(Emilio Sala since Gorodetsky was an avid hunter.[5] The name does not refer to )Tj
T*(the chimaera of mythology, but to an architectural style known as chimaera )Tj
T*(decoration in which animal figures are applied as decorative elements to a )Tj
T*(building. Gorodetsky's unique architectural style earned him praise as the )Tj
T*(Antoni GaudÃ­ of Kiev.[4][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Construction and early history )Tj
T*( The House with Chimaeras was designed by the architect Vladislav Gorodetsky in )Tj
T*(1901â€“1902.[4] Gorodetsky was born in 1863 into a prosperous Polish szlachta )Tj
T*(family in the Podillia region.[5] After finishing the Imperial Academy of Arts )Tj
T*(in Saint Petersburg in 1890, he moved to Kiev, where he lived for almost 30 )Tj
T*(years.[5] At the time of the building's construction, Gorodetsky had already )Tj
T*(established himself as a prominent Kiev architect, having designed and )Tj
T*(constructed together with his close friend and partner engineer Anton Strauss )Tj
T*(many city buildings, from the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral to the )Tj
T*(Karaim Kenesa and what today is the National Art Museum of Ukraine. Besides )Tj
T*(architecture, Gorodetsky was also interested in big-game hunting,[5] which )Tj
T*(explains why his building features many animals. )Tj
T*( Gorodetsky financed the house's construction with borrowed money,[4][7] with )Tj
T*(the intent for it to be an apartment building.[8][9] Each floor formed a single )Tj
T*(apartment, connected by an elevator and stairs.[nb 1] Gorodetsky himself )Tj
T*(occupied the fourth floor of the building, measuring at about 380Â m2 \(4,100Â sqÂ )Tj
T*(ft\).[8][nb 2] )Tj
T*( Gorodetsky bought the first lot of land on February 1, 1901, with construction )Tj
T*(work commencing on March 18 of that year. Construction of the exterior walls )Tj
T*(was finished by August 21, and the roof installed and all masonry work was )Tj
T*(completed on September 13.[8][9] Due to the economic hardships within the )Tj
T*(Russian Empire, the completion of the building was delayed. In May 1903, only )Tj
T*(one apartment on the lowest level and Gorodetsky's own apartment were )Tj
T*(occupied.[8] The total cost of the land and construction amounted to 133,000 )Tj
T*(rubles.[nb 3] In total, 1,550Â m2 \(16,700Â sqÂ ft\) of land were used for )Tj
T*(construction of the building and cost a total of 15,640 rubles.[7] The )Tj
T*(projected annual profit from the rentals was 7,200 rubles. A cowshed was )Tj
T*(located on the premises due to Gorodetsky's insistence on fresh in-house )Tj
T*(milk,[4][9] though it was specifically placed in a way that the smell of the )Tj
T*(cows would not disturb the tenants. On a lot adjacent to the building, a )Tj
T*(miniature alpine garden \(approx. 320Â m2/3,400Â sqÂ ft\) and a fountain were built. )Tj
T*( Due to financial mismanagement which included his Safari hunting hobby,[4] in )Tj
T*(July 1912, Gorodetsky pledged the building as a collateral against a loan taken )Tj
T*(from Kiev Mutual Credit Association.[3] When Gorodetsky defaulted on the loan, )Tj
T*(the building was auctioned off in 1913,[3] and became the property of the )Tj
T*(engineer Daniel Balakhovsky,[4] the son of a Kiev trader,[7] who was also the )Tj
T*(Chairman of the Board of Directors of Blahodatinskoe sugar factory,[7] and a )Tj
T*(French Ñonsular agent in Kiev.[10] In 1916, the house belonged to the )Tj

T*(again, to Samuel Nemets.[3] In 1921, after the Bolsheviks gained control of )Tj
T*(Kiev, several of the departments of the Kiev Military District took offices in )Tj
T*(the House with Chimaeras. )Tj
T*( [edit] Ownership 1921â€“2002 )Tj
T*( After the period of unrest following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the )Tj
T*(building was nationalized and later converted for communal living.[11] Each )Tj
T*(apartment was occupied by about nine to ten families.[8] During the Second )Tj
T*(World War \(1941â€“1943\), the building was abandoned. Due to exposure to the harsh )Tj
T*(elements during the war, the building suffered significant damage to its )Tj
T*(structure.[8] After the war, the building was briefly used as a residence for )Tj
T*(evacuated actors from the Ivan Franko Theater;[7] however, the Central )Tj
T*(Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic )Tj
T*(took ownership of the building and later transformed it into the Polyclinic )Tj
T*(\(clinic\) No. 1 for their elite.[8] The polyclinic used the building up until )Tj
T*(the end of the 20th century. During that time, the building almost split in )Tj
T*(half. One part sagged 22Â cm \(9Â in\), and a major vertical crack formed, having a )Tj
T*(width of about 40Â cm \(16Â in\).[8] Some of the building's architectural details )Tj
T*(had either been chipped away, or had cracked. )Tj
T*( The building's restoration work was scheduled for 2002, however the operators )Tj
T*(of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for )Tj
T*(over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers )Tj
T*(boarded up all of the windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the )Tj
T*(polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the )Tj
T*(matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reconstruction and official use )Tj
T*( During the time of the restoration, conducted by UkrNIIProektRestavratsiya and )Tj
T*(headed by Natalia Kosenko,[12] the workers unearthed the whole lower floor, )Tj
T*(which had been filled in during Soviet times to strengthen the building's )Tj
T*(foundation.[4] Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be )Tj
T*(fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, )Tj
T*(fountains, and a miniature gardenâ€”all of which had been in Gorodetsky's )Tj
T*(original plans.[4] )Tj
T*( The building was opened as a filial "Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art" of the )Tj
T*(National Museum of Arts in November 2004.[13] It was expected that the building )Tj
T*(would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place )Tj
T*(for state visitors. In April 2005, the Kiev City Council submitted a bill[14] )Tj
T*(for 104 million hryvnias \(approx. US $20 million\) to the Ukrainian Government )Tj
T*(for reconstruction and restoration of the House with Chimaeras.[15] The Council )Tj
T*(also allowed the Ukrainian government to construct a new square \(closing off )Tj
T*(all automobile traffic\) in front of the building for use in official )Tj
T*(ceremonies.[15] )Tj
T*( Since May 2005, the building has been an official presidential residence, used )Tj
T*(for official and diplomatic ceremonies.[1][2] The House with Chimaeras was used )Tj
T*(as a meeting place between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Russian )Tj
T*(President Vladimir Putin, when the latter visited Kiev on December 22, )Tj
T*(2006.[16] Included in the building are rooms for negotiations, tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte )Tj

T*(specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From )Tj
T*(the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the )Tj
T*(rear, all of its six floors can be seen.[18] One part of the building's )Tj
T*(foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous )Tj
T*(foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Gorodetsky )Tj
T*(somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem. )Tj
T*( The Italian sculptor Emilio Sala was responsible for both the internal and )Tj
T*(external sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs on the )Tj
T*(roof of the building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, )Tj
T*(and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers )Tj

T*(sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement )Tj
T*(was by the Â«ForÂ» company of which Gorodetsky was the co-director.[19] Cement )Tj
T*(was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the )Tj
T*(company's head director, Richter.[20] At the time of the building's )Tj

T*( [edit] Floor plan )Tj
T*( The House with Chimaeras was designed in such a way that the tenants would )Tj
T*(occupy the whole floor, each floor had all the necessary household rooms )Tj
T*(ranging from private kitchens to small powder rooms. The open floor plan and )Tj
T*(extra rooms featured throughout the building are characteristic of the houses )Tj
T*(of the wealthy of the early 20th century.[18] In total, the building has an )Tj
T*(area of 3,309.5Â m2 \(35,623.16Â sqÂ ft\).[12] )Tj
T*( On the lowest level of the building, which is located deep in the hill, were )Tj
T*(two stables, two rooms for coachmen, a shared laundry, and two separate )Tj
T*(apartments. Each of the two apartments consisted of a foyer, a kitchen, one )Tj
T*(bathroom, and a storage room. The first of these apartments had two residential )Tj
T*(rooms, and the second three rooms.[nb 4] Each floor above the lowest level was )Tj
T*(designed to house a single apartment only. )Tj
T*( The apartment on the second floor consisted of six residential rooms in )Tj
T*(addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two )Tj
T*(toilets, and two storage rooms. There were also four wine cellars on the same )Tj
T*(level.[nb 5] The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the )Tj
T*(third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a )Tj
T*(kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two )Tj
T*(toilets.[nb 6] This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of )Tj
T*(Bankova Street, from the front entrance. )Tj
T*( The grandest apartment, which belonged to Gorodetsky, consisted of a study, a )Tj
T*(great room and a living room, a dining room, a boudoir, a bedroom, a children's )Tj
T*(room, a room for a governess, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a )Tj
T*(kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms.[8] On )Tj
T*(the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Gorodetsky's )Tj
T*(apartment.[nb 7] The apartment on the top floor had one less room; to make up )Tj
T*(for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided a panoramic view of the )Tj

T*(including the architect Alexander Skobelev, who had tried to prove that was )Tj
T*(impossible to build a house on such terrain, because the site \(near the Ivan )Tj
T*(Franko Theater\) overhangs a swamp \(Kozâ€™ye boloto\). The Construction Committee )Tj
T*(of Kiev had prohibited construction of any structures on this particular lot, )Tj
T*(but eventually the construction of the building allowed Gorodetsky to win the )Tj
T*(bet.[22] )Tj
T*( According to the third legend, Gorodetsky had cursed the house when forced to )Tj

T*(Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king's )Tj
T*(subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on Christmas Day in 597. )Tj
T*(Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and )Tj
T*(gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native Celtic bishops )Tj
T*(to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at )Tj
T*(London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon )Tj
T*(priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his )Tj
T*(successor, Laurence of Canterbury. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was )Tj
T*(soon revered as a saint. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background to the mission )Tj
T*( After the withdrawal of the Roman legions from the province of Britannia in )Tj
T*(410, the people of the province were left to defend themselves against the )Tj
T*(attacks of the Saxons. Before the withdrawal Britannia converted to )Tj
T*(Christianity and produced the ascetic Pelagius.[4][5] Britain sent three )Tj
T*(bishops to the Council of Arles in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island )Tj
T*(in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.[6] Material remains testify to a )Tj
T*(growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.[7] After the legions )Tj
T*(left, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western )Tj
T*(Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native )Tj
T*(British Church developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of )Tj
T*(missionaries from Ireland[4][5] and was centred on monasteries instead of )Tj
T*(bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the )Tj
T*(date of Easter and the style of the tonsure haircut that clerics wore.[5][8] )Tj
T*(Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during )Tj
T*(this time includes the survival of the cult of Saint Alban and the occurrence )Tj
T*(in place names of eccles, derived from the Latin ecclesia, meaning "church".[9] )Tj
T*(There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxons.[10][11] The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman )Tj
T*(civilization in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the )Tj
T*(economic and religious structures.[12] )Tj
T*( It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, )Tj
T*(often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity )Tj
T*(in 595.[13][14] The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Ã†thelberht, who married a )Tj
T*(Christian princess named Bertha before 588,[15] and perhaps earlier than )Tj
T*(560.[16] Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the Merovingian kings )Tj
T*(of the Franks. As one of the conditions of her marriage she brought a bishop )Tj
T*(named Liudhard with her to Kent.[17] Together in Canterbury, they restored a )Tj
T*(church that dated to Roman times[18]â€”possibly the current St Martin's Church, )Tj
T*(Canterbury. Ã†thelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom )Tj
T*(of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, )Tj
T*(Ã†thelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.[17] The historian Ian Wood )Tj
T*(feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.[19] )Tj
T*(Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although )Tj
T*(the exact reasons remain unclear. Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history )Tj
T*(of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired )Tj
T*(Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to )Tj
T*(convert their people.[b][21] More practical matters, such as the acquisition of )Tj
T*(new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to )Tj
T*(influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Ã†thelberht, were )Tj
T*(probably involved.[18] The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary )Tj
T*(efforts against the Lombards.[22] )Tj
T*( Aside from Ã†thelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice )Tj
T*(of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the )Tj
T*(dominant power in south-eastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of )Tj
T*(Wessex in 592, Ã†thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to )Tj
T*(Ã†thelberht as having imperium \(overlordship\) south of the River Humber. Trade )Tj
T*(between the Franks and Ã†thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the )Tj
T*(language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, )Tj
T*(as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's )Tj

T*(proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.[23] There is )Tj
T*(some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the )Tj
T*(mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship )Tj
T*(over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a )Tj
T*(Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if )Tj
T*(Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and )Tj
T*(not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not )Tj
T*(merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as )Tj
T*(well.[24] )Tj
T*( In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the Abbey of St Andrew's )Tj
T*(in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.[13] The pope selected monks to accompany )Tj
T*(Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series )Tj
T*(of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King Theuderic II )Tj
T*(of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their )Tj
T*(grandmother Brunhild, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King )Tj
T*(Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish )Tj
T*(bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the )Tj
T*(mission.[25] By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory )Tj
T*(helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Ã†thelbert was )Tj
T*(unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's )Tj
T*(relatives and people.[26] Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to )Tj
T*(participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in )Tj
T*(particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his )Tj
T*(kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.[27] )Tj
T*( Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. )Tj
T*(Pope Gregory once wrote to Ã†thelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of )Tj
T*(the Bible, so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications )Tj
T*(included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as )Tj
T*(well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to )Tj
T*(Augustine, the prior.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Arrival and first efforts )Tj
T*( Augustine was accompanied by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to )Tj
T*(the archbishopric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were )Tj
T*(monks.[15] Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the )Tj
T*(nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request )Tj
T*(papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with )Tj
T*(letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.[29] In 597, Augustine and )Tj
T*(his companions landed in Kent.[15] They achieved some initial success soon )Tj
T*(after their arrival:[22][28] Ã†thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle )Tj
T*(and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St )Tj
T*(Martin's for services.[30] Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of )Tj
T*(Ã†thelberht's conversion,[31] but it probably took place in 597.[30][c] In the )Tj
T*(early medieval period, large scale conversions required the ruler's conversion )Tj
T*(first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a )Tj
T*(year of his arrival in Kent.[30] Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both )Tj
T*(Ã†thelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his )Tj
T*(baptism.[d] A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler )Tj
T*(Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2 )Tj
T*(June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other )Tj
T*(evidence for it.[30] Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to )Tj
T*(Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598, which mentions the number of )Tj
T*(converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. )Tj
T*(However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.[32] His baptism )Tj
T*(likely took place at Canterbury.[33] )Tj
T*( Augustine established his episcopal see at Canterbury.[22] It is not clear )Tj
T*(when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a )Tj
T*(century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop )Tj
T*(Ã†therius of Arles after the conversion of Ã†thelberht. Contemporary letters from )Tj
T*(Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in )Tj
T*(England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and )Tj

T*(one ten months later says that Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's )Tj
T*(command by bishops of the German lands.[34] The historian R. A. Markus )Tj
T*(discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and )Tj
T*(suggests that he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues that )Tj
T*(the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.[35] )Tj
T*( Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and )Tj
T*(Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey,[22] on land donated by the )Tj
T*(king.[36] This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey )Tj
T*(outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the Rule of St. )Tj
T*(Benedict into England, but there is no evidence that the abbey followed the )Tj
T*(Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.[37] In a letter Gregory wrote )Tj
T*(to the patriarch of Alexandria in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 )Tj
T*(Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no )Tj
T*(reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.[15][28] However, there were )Tj
T*(probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of )Tj
T*(the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.[11] Little )Tj
T*(literary traces remain of them, however.[38] One other effect of the king's )Tj
T*(conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the )Tj
T*(southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.[39] )Tj
T*( After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of )Tj
T*(his success along with questions about the mission.[40] Bede records the letter )Tj
T*(and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis )Tj
T*(Anglorum, this section of the History is usually known as the Libellus )Tj
T*(responsionum.[41][42] Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of )Tj
T*(issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church )Tj
T*(robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of )Tj
T*(bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, )Tj
T*(childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion )Tj
T*(and for a priest to celebrate mass.[42] )Tj
T*( Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a pallium for )Tj
T*(Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, and books.[e] The )Tj
T*(pallium was the symbol of metropolitan status, and signified that Augustine was )Tj
T*(now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the )Tj
T*(pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 )Tj
T*(suffragan bishops as soon as possible and to send a bishop to York. Gregory's )Tj
T*(plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, )Tj
T*(with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, )Tj
T*(Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from )Tj
T*(Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary )Tj
T*(sources give the reason,[47] but it was probably because London was not part of )Tj
T*(Ã†thelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the kingdom of Essex, ruled )Tj
T*(by Ã†thelberht's nephew Saebert of Essex, who converted to Christianity in )Tj
T*(604.[18][48] The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see )Tj
T*(was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London )Tj
T*(as a see after the death of Ã†thelberht that Canterbury became the )Tj
T*(archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, )Tj
T*(however.[49] )Tj
T*( [edit] Additional work )Tj
T*( In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come )Tj
T*(to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, Mellitus as Bishop of London and )Tj
T*(Justus as Bishop of Rochester.[18][50][51] Bede relates that Augustine, with )Tj
T*(the help of the king, "recovered" a church built by Roman Christians in )Tj
T*(Canterbury.[52][f] It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the )Tj
T*(church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for )Tj
T*(pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter )Tj
T*(interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the )Tj
T*(Romano-British period were uncovered just south of the present Canterbury )Tj
T*(Cathedral.[52] The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the Libellus )Tj
T*(points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the )Tj
T*(topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but )Tj

T*(also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.[55] )Tj
T*( Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and )Tj
T*(Dumnonia to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit )Tj
T*(to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,[56] apparently believing )Tj
T*(that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organization survived in )Tj
T*(the Britain than was actually the case.[57] According to the narrative of Bede, )Tj
T*(the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their )Tj
T*(suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.[58] )Tj
T*(In 603, Augustine and Ã†thelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting )Tj
T*(south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their )Tj
T*(people,[59] who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon )Tj
T*(the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise )Tj
T*(from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,[60] they refused to )Tj
T*(recognise him as their archbishop.[59][61] There were, however, deep )Tj
T*(differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more )Tj
T*(significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the )Tj
T*(observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to )Tj
T*(asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.[58] )Tj
T*(Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history )Tj
T*(and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their )Tj
T*(bishops.[61] Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's )Tj
T*(efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and )Tj
T*(Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the )Tj
T*(Britons.[62] )Tj
T*( [edit] Further success )Tj
T*( Easier to implement were Rome's mandates concerning pagan temples and )Tj
T*(celebrations. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,[63] and feasts, )Tj
T*(if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site )Tj
T*(was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were )Tj
T*(unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native )Tj
T*(Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was )Tj
T*(informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman )Tj
T*(St Sixtus.[64] )Tj
T*( Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the )Tj
T*(new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English )Tj
T*(bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. )Tj
T*(Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' )Tj
T*(conduct.[65] )Tj
T*( The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, which would )Tj
T*(make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records )Tj
T*(of the school date from the 16th century.[66] Augustine did establish a school, )Tj
T*(and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support )Tj
T*(the East Anglian mission.[67] Augustine received liturgical books from the )Tj
T*(pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new )Tj
T*(mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that )Tj
T*(Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form )Tj
T*(of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] Death and legacy )Tj
T*( Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence as his successor to the )Tj
T*(archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office.[69] Although )Tj
T*(at the time of Augustine's death, 26 May 604,[22] the mission barely extended )Tj
T*(beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the )Tj
T*(British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, )Tj
T*(no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was )Tj
T*(sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the )Tj
T*(decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.[58][70] Much of his )Tj
T*(success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Ã†thelberht, )Tj
T*(which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.[71] Augustine's example )Tj
T*(also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.[72][73] )Tj

T*(Augustine's, Canterbury,[36] but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb )Tj
T*(within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. )Tj
T*(After the Norman Conquest the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.[22] )Tj
T*(After the Conquest, his shrine in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position )Tj
T*(in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence )Tj
T*(and Mellitus.[74] King Henry I of England granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six )Tj
T*(day fair around the date on which Augustine's relics were translated to his new )Tj
T*(shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.[75] )Tj
T*( A life of Augustine was written by Goscelin around 1090, but this life )Tj
T*(portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account )Tj
T*(has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and )Tj
T*(imagined speeches.[76] Building on this account, later medieval writers )Tj
T*(continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite )Tj
T*(fanciful.[77] These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that )Tj
T*(Augustine founded Cerne Abbey,[78] the author \(generally believed to be John )Tj
T*(Brompton\) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from )Tj
T*(Augustine,[79] and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their )Tj
T*(romances.[80] Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is )Tj
T*(the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning )Tj
T*(Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of )Tj
T*(Hippo, a fourth century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature )Tj
T*(Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however.[81] During the English )Tj
T*(Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost. )Tj
T*( The Augustine's shrine was re-established in March 2012 at the church of St. )Tj
T*(Augustine in Ramsgate, Kent, very close to the mission's landing )Tj
T*(site.[82][83]St Augustine's Cross, a Celtic cross erected in 1884, marks the )Tj
T*(spot in Ebbsfleet, Thanet, East Kent, where Augustine is said to have )Tj
T*(landed,[84] although historian Alan Kay told the BBC in 2005 that Augustine )Tj
T*(actually landed somewhere between Stonar and Sandwich. According to Kay, )Tj
T*(Ebbsfleet was not on the coast in the sixth century, and that the story of )Tj
T*(Augustine's landing there was started in 1884 by a Victorian aristocrat who )Tj
T*(needed a publicity stunt to draw people to his newly opened tea rooms.[85] )Tj

T*( ^ The name is in the halo, in a later hand. The figure is identified as a )Tj
T*(saint, rather than Christ, by his clerical tonsure.[1] The view that it )Tj
T*(represents Gregory is set out by Douglas Michaels in a recent article.[2])Tj
T*(^ Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were )Tj
T*(Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not )Tj
T*(Angles, but Angels.[20])Tj
T*(^ However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as )Tj
T*(occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his )Tj
T*(conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before )Tj
T*(Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's )Tj
T*(conversion was due to Augustine's mission.[16] However, as Gregory in his )Tj
T*(letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable )Tj
T*(to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a )Tj
T*(chronological error on Bede's part.[32])Tj
T*(^ The letter, as translated in Brooks' Early History of the Church of )Tj
T*(Canterbury, p. 8, says "preserve the grace he had received". Grace in this )Tj
T*(context meant the grace of baptism.)Tj
T*(^ What happened to these items in later years is unknown. Thomas Elmham, a 15th )Tj
T*(century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of )Tj
T*(these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the )Tj
T*(Danish attacks in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the Norman )Tj
T*(Conquest of England in 1066 or used for the ransom of King Richard I of England )Tj
T*(in the 1190s.[43] The surviving St Augustine Gospels, \(Corpus Christi College, )Tj
T*(Cambridge manuscript \(MS\) 286\) which is a 6th-century Italian illuminated )Tj

T*( William Ford Gibson \(born March 17, 1948\) is an American-Canadian speculative )Tj
T*(fiction novelist who has been called the "noir prophet" of the cyberpunk )Tj
T*(subgenre.[16] Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in his short story "Burning )Tj
T*(Chrome" \(1982\) and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, )Tj
T*(Neuromancer \(1984\). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for )Tj
T*(the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.[17] He is )Tj
T*(also credited with predicting the rise of reality television and with )Tj
T*(establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual )Tj
T*(environments such as video games and the World Wide Web. )Tj
T*( Having changed residence frequently with his family as a child, Gibson became )Tj
T*(a shy, ungainly teenager who often read science fiction. After spending his )Tj

T*(during the Vietnam War by emigrating to Canada in 1968, where he became )Tj
T*(immersed in the counterculture and after settling in Vancouver eventually )Tj
T*(became a full-time writer. He retains dual citizenship.[18] Gibson's early )Tj
T*(works are bleak, noir near-future stories about the effect of cybernetics and )Tj
T*(computer networks on humansâ€”a "combination of lowlife and high tech".[19] The )Tj

T*(Appalachians where his parents had been born and raised.[20][21] His family )Tj
T*(moved frequently during Gibson's youth owing to his father's position as )Tj
T*(manager of a large construction company.[22] In Norfolk, Virginia, Gibson )Tj
T*(attended Pines Elementary School, where the teachers' lack of encouragement for )Tj

T*(credits the beginnings of his relationship with science fiction, his "native )Tj
T*(literary culture",[26] with the subsequent feeling of abrupt exile.[20] At the )Tj

T*(Toronto, and left a week or two later.[26] In the biographical documentary No )Tj

T*( After weeks of nominal homelessness, Gibson was hired as the manager of )Tj
T*(Toronto's first head shop, a retailer of drug paraphernalia.[31] He found the )Tj
T*(city's Ã©migrÃ© community of American draft dodgers unbearable owing to the )Tj
T*(prevalence of clinical depression, suicide and hardcore substance abuse.[26] He )Tj
T*(appeared, during the Summer of Love of 1967, in a CBC newsreel item about )Tj
T*(hippie subculture in Yorkville, Toronto,[32] for which he was paid $500 â€“ the )Tj
T*(equivalent of 20 weeks rent â€“ which financed his later travels.[33] Aside from )Tj
T*(a "brief, riot-torn spell" in the District of Columbia, Gibson spent the rest )Tj
T*(of the 1960s in Toronto, where he met Vancouverite Deborah Jean Thompson,[34] )Tj
T*(with whom he subsequently traveled to Europe.[20] Gibson has recounted that )Tj
T*(they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and )Tj
T*(favourable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and )Tj
T*(in Istanbul in 1970,[35] as they "couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had )Tj

T*( Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors Bruce )Tj

T*(Sterling put it, "breakthrough material" and that they needed to "put down our )Tj
T*(preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way )Tj
T*(forward."[26][40] Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in )Tj
T*(Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read "Burning Chrome"Â â€“ the )Tj
T*(first cyberspace short storyÂ â€“ to an audience of four people, and later stated )Tj
T*(that Sterling "completely got it".[26] )Tj
T*( In October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, at which )Tj
T*(he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called "Behind the )Tj
T*(Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF", where Shiner noted "the sense of a movement )Tj
T*(solidified".[40] After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, )Tj
T*(drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring )Tj
T*(half-jokingly that "a new axis has been formed."[40] Sterling, Shiner, Shirley )Tj
T*(and Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, went on to form the core of the radical )Tj
T*(cyberpunk literary movement.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Literary career )Tj
T*( [edit] Early short fiction )Tj
T*( Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences )Tj
T*(of cybernetics and cyberspace \(computer-simulated reality\) technology on the )Tj
T*(human race! His themes of hi-tech shanty towns, recorded or broadcast stimulus )Tj
T*(\(later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in )Tj
T*(Neuromancer\), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are )Tj
T*(already evident in his first published short story, "Fragments of a Hologram )Tj
T*(Rose" \(1977\).[8] The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and )Tj
T*(fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story )Tj
T*(collection Burning Chrome, as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife )Tj
T*(and high tech."[19] )Tj
T*( In the early 1980s, Gibson's stories appeared in Omni and Universe 11, wherein )Tj
T*(his fiction developed a bleak, film noir feel. He consciously distanced himself )Tj
T*(as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction \(towards which he )Tj
T*(felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "The Gernsback Continuum"\), to the )Tj
T*(extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor cult figure, a sort of )Tj
T*(lesser Ballard."[8] When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found )Tj
T*(that "people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they literally could not )Tj
T*(parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just )Tj
T*(beyond peoples' grasp."[26] )Tj
T*( While Larry McCaffery has commented that these early short stories displayed )Tj
T*(flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic Darko Suvin has identified )Tj
T*(them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Neuromancer was commissioned by Terry Carr for the third series of Ace Science )Tj
T*(Fiction Specials, which was intended to exclusively feature debut novels. Given )Tj
T*(a year to complete the work,[42] Gibson undertook the actual writing out of )Tj
T*("blind animal terror" at the obligation to write an entire novelÂ â€“ a feat which )Tj
T*(he felt he was "four or five years away from".[8] After viewing the first 20 )Tj
T*(minutes of landmark cyberpunk film Blade Runner \(1982\) which was released when )Tj
T*(Gibson had written a third of the novel, he "figured [Neuromancer] was sunk, )Tj
T*(done for. Everyone would assume Iâ€™d copped my visual texture from this )Tj
T*(astonishingly fine-looking film."[43] He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the )Tj
T*(book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that )Tj
T*(he would be "permanently shamed" following its publication; yet what resulted )Tj
T*(was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.[8] )Tj
T*( Neuromancer's release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural )Tj
T*(nerve,[44] quickly becoming an underground word-of-mouth hit.[39] It became the )Tj
T*(first novel to win the "triple crown"[8] of science fiction awards \(the Nebula, )Tj
T*(the Hugo, and Philip K. Dick Award for paperback original\), eventually selling )Tj
T*(more than 6.5Â million copies worldwide.[45] )Tj
T*( Lawrence Person in his "Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto" \(1998\) )Tj
T*(identified Neuromancer as "the archetypal cyberpunk work",[46] and in 2005, )Tj

T*(with human consciousness... human memory is literalized and mechanized... )Tj
T*(multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new )Tj
T*(structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above )Tj

T*(Neuromancer that "I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any )Tj
T*(money," and referred to the novel as "an adolescent's book".[26] The success of )Tj
T*(Neuromancer was to affect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from )Tj
T*(obscurity.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Sprawl trilogy, The Difference Engine, and the Bridge trilogy )Tj
T*( Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in Neuromancer, his )Tj
T*(work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically.[49] Despite adding the )Tj
T*(final sentence of Neuromancer, "He never saw Molly again", at the last minute )Tj
T*(in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did )Tj
T*(precisely that with Count Zero \(1986\), a character-focused work set in the )Tj
T*(Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor.[50] He next intended to write an )Tj
T*(unrelated postmodern space opera, titled The Log of the Mustang Sally, but )Tj
T*(reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the )Tj
T*(dustjacket art of their hardcover of Count Zero.[51] Abandoning The Log of the )Tj
T*(Mustang Sally, Gibson instead wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive \(1988\), which in the )Tj
T*(words of Larry McCaffery "turned off the lights" on cyberpunk )Tj
T*(literature.[8][39] It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the )Tj

T*(The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation,[52] with both later novels also )Tj
T*(earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations [53][54][55] )Tj
T*( The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( After All Tomorrow's Parties, Gibson began to adopt a more realist style of )Tj

T*(past."[64] Science fiction critic John Clute has interpreted this approach as )Tj
T*(Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible "in )Tj
T*(a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from", characterizing it as "SF for )Tj
T*(the new century".[65] Gibson's novels Pattern Recognition \(2003\), Spook Country )Tj

T*( A phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of )Tj

T*(threatening "to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is )Tj
T*(conducted".[69] )Tj
T*( After the September 11, 2001 attacks, with about 100 pages of Pattern )Tj

T*(collection Heatseeker \(1989\).[77] Shirley convinced Gibson to write a story for )Tj
T*(the television series Max Headroom for which Shirley had written several )Tj
T*(scripts, but the network canceled the series.[78] )Tj
T*( Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story "The Angel of )Tj
T*(Goliad" in 1990,[77] which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate )Tj
T*(history story The Difference Engine \(1990\). The two were later "invited to )Tj
T*(dream in public" \(Gibson\) in a joint address to the U.S. National Academy of )Tj
T*(Sciences Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 \("the Al Gore )Tj
T*(people"[78]\), in which they argued against the digital divide[79] and "appalled )Tj
T*(everyone" by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking )Tj
T*(place over the Internet.[80] In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling )Tj
T*(had an idea for "a second recursive science novel that was just a wonderful )Tj
T*(idea", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration because he was )Tj
T*(not creatively free at the time.[64] )Tj
T*( In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on Yellow )Tj
T*(Magic Orchestra's Technodon album,[81][82] and wrote lyrics to the track "Dog )Tj
T*(Star Girl" for Deborah Harry's Debravation.[83] )Tj
T*( [edit] Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances )Tj
T*( Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer )Tj
T*(discovered a waterlogged copy of Neuromancer on a beach at a Thai resort.[84] )Tj
T*(His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as )Tj
T*(finished product; "Burning Chrome" \(which was to be directed by Kathryn )Tj
T*(Bigelow\) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations )Tj
T*(that were never made.[78] In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of Alien )Tj
T*(3 \(which he later characterized as "Tarkovskian"\), few elements of which )Tj
T*(survived in the final version.[78] Gibson's early involvement with the film )Tj
T*(industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. )Tj
T*(At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov )Tj
T*(after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American )Tj
T*(collaboration to star Russian-Korean star Victor Tsoi.[85] Despite being )Tj
T*(occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully )Tj
T*(odd project" which involved "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of )Tj
T*(sideways-future Leningrad" and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather )Tj
T*(than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a )Tj
T*(car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel )Tj
T*(Let's Put the Future Behind Us and informed much of the Russian content of )Tj
T*(Gibson's Pattern Recognition.[85] A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration )Tj
T*(with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991,[39] a film they plotted on shooting )Tj
T*(in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.[11] )Tj
T*( Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to )Tj
T*(limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the Sprawl )Tj
T*(trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic \(1995\) )Tj
T*(with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi )Tj
T*(Kitano, and New Rose Hotel \(1998\), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, )Tj
T*(and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was )Tj
T*(launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video )Tj
T*(game.[61]Neuromancer, after a long stay in development hell, is in the process )Tj
T*(of adaptation as of 2007[update],[86]Count Zero was at one point being )Tj
T*(developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the )Tj
T*(third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned )Tj
T*(and bought.[87] An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in )Tj
T*(2006,[88] and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director )Tj
T*(Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to )Tj
T*(the project.[89] )Tj
T*( Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with )Tj
T*(friend Tom Maddox, The X-Files episodes "Kill Switch" and "First Person )Tj
T*(Shooter", broadcast in the U.S. on 20th Century Fox Television in 1998 and )Tj
T*(2000.[49][90] In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off )Tj
T*(publication Art of the X-Files. Gibson made a cameo appearance in the )Tj
T*(television miniseries Wild Palms at the behest of creator Bruce Wagner.[91] )Tj

T*(Director Oliver Stone had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the )Tj
T*(series,[58] and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an )Tj
T*(article, "Where The Holograms Go", to the Wild Palms Reader.[91] He accepted )Tj
T*(another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside Douglas Coupland in the short )Tj
T*(film Mon Amour Mon Parapluie in which the pair played philosophers.[92] )Tj
T*(Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical )Tj
T*(documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called No Maps for These Territories. The )Tj
T*(film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing )Tj
T*(various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It )Tj
T*(features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations )Tj
T*(from Neuromancer by Bono and The Edge.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art )Tj
T*( Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of performance art )Tj
T*(pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with )Tj
T*(acclaimed sculptor and future Johnny Mnemonic director Robert Longo[48] titled )Tj
T*(Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes, which was displayed in Royce Hall, )Tj
T*(University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed )Tj
T*(original text to "Memory Palace", a performance show featuring the theater )Tj
T*(group La Fura dels Baus at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by )Tj
T*(Karl Sims, Rebecca Allen, Mark Pellington with music by Peter Gabriel and )Tj
T*(others.[81] It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would )Tj
T*(later act as dramaturg and "cyberprops" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley )Tj
T*(Sherman's adaptation of "Burning Chrome" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest )Tj
T*(contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed )Tj
T*(Vancouver-based contemporary dance company Holy Body Tattoo and Gibson's friend )Tj
T*(and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.[93] )Tj
T*( In 1990, Gibson contributed to "Visionary San Francisco", an exhibition at the )Tj
T*(San Francisco Museum of Modern Art shown from June 14 to August 26.[94] He )Tj
T*(wrote a short story, "Skinner's Room", set in a decaying San Francisco in which )Tj
T*(the San Francisco â€“ Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and taken over by the )Tj
T*(homeless â€“ a setting Gibson then detailed in the Bridge trilogy. The story )Tj
T*(inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig )Tj
T*(Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, )Tj
T*(solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.[95] The )Tj
T*(architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and )Tj
T*(reading from "Skinner's Room".[81]The New York Times hailed the exhibition as )Tj
T*("one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of )Tj
T*(architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last )Tj
T*(decade", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution )Tj
T*("a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work".[95] A slightly different )Tj
T*(version of the short story was featured a year later in Omni.[96] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cryptography )Tj
T*( A particularly well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa \(a book of the dead\) )Tj
T*(\(1992\), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his )Tj
T*(contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and )Tj
T*(publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.[97] Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of )Tj
T*(memories \(the title refers to a photo album\) and was originally published on a )Tj
T*(3.5" floppy disk embedded in the back of an artist's book containing etchings )Tj
T*(by Ashbaugh \(intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to )Tj
T*(light â€” they never did, however\). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design )Tj
T*("eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to )Tj
T*(display the text only once, then eat itself."[98] Contrary to numerous colorful )Tj
T*(reports, the diskettes were never actually "hacked"; instead the poem was )Tj
T*(manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in )Tj
T*(Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next )Tj
T*(day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.[99] )Tj
T*( Since its debut in 1992, the mystery of Agrippa remains hidden, even now 20 )Tj
T*(years later. Although many have tried to hack the unbreakable code and decrypt )Tj
T*(the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his )Tj

T*( [edit] Essays and short-form nonfiction )Tj
T*( Gibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and )Tj
T*(journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to Wired )Tj
T*(and of op-eds to The New York Times, and has written for The Observer, Addicted )Tj
T*(to Noise, New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Details Magazine. His )Tj
T*(first major piece of nonfiction, the article "Disneyland with the Death )Tj
T*(Penalty" concerning the city-state of Singapore, resulted in Wired being banned )Tj
T*(from the country and attracted a spirited critical response.[103][104] He )Tj
T*(commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into )Tj
T*(his reaction to Pattern Recognition, but abated in September of the same year )Tj
T*(owing to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative )Tj
T*(process.[105][106] Gibson re-commenced blogging in October 2004, and during the )Tj
T*(process of writing Spook Country â€“ and to a lesser extent Zero History â€“ )Tj
T*(frequently posted short nonsequential excerpts from the novel to the blog.[107] )Tj
T*(The blog was largely discontinued by July 2009, after the writer had undertaken )Tj
T*(prolific microblogging on Twitter under the nom de plume "GreatDismal".[108] In )Tj
T*(2012, Gibson released a collection of his non-fiction works entitled Distrust )Tj

T*( [edit] Influence and recognition )Tj
T*( Hailed by Steven Poole of The Guardian in 1999 as "probably the most important )Tj
T*(novelist of the past two decades" in terms of influence,[63] Gibson first )Tj
T*(achieved critical recognition with his debut novel, Neuromancer. The novel won )Tj
T*(three major science fiction awards \(the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, )Tj
T*(and the Hugo Award\), an unprecedented achievement described by the Mail &amp; )Tj
T*(Guardian as "the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and )Tj
T*(Pulitzer prizes in the same year".[61]Neuromancer gained unprecedented critical )Tj
T*(and popular attention outside science fiction,[8] as an "evocation of life in )Tj
T*(the late 1980s",[110] although The Observer noted that "it took the New York )Tj
T*(Times 10 years" to mention the novel.[21] )Tj
T*( Gibson's work has received international attention[22] from an audience that )Tj
T*(was not limited to science fiction aficionados as, in the words of Laura )Tj
T*(Miller, "readers found startlingly prophetic reflections of contemporary life )Tj
T*(in [its] fantastic and often outright paranoid scenarios."[111] It is often )Tj
T*(situated by critics within the context of postindustrialism as, according to )Tj
T*(academic David Brande, a construction of "a mirror of existing large-scale )Tj
T*(techno-social relations",[112] and as a narrative version of postmodern )Tj
T*(consumer culture.[113] It is praised by critics for its depictions of late )Tj
T*(capitalism[112] and its "rewriting of subjectivity, human consciousness and )Tj
T*(behaviour made newly problematic by technology."[113] Tatiani Rapatzikou, )Tj
T*(writing in The Literary Encyclopedia, identifies Gibson as "one of North )Tj

T*(science fiction studies.[44] In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, )Tj
T*(Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way )Tj
T*(people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction )Tj
T*(literature.[114] The publication of Neuromancer \(1984\) hit a cultural )Tj
T*(nerve,[44] causing Larry McCaffery to credit Gibson with virtually launching )Tj
T*(the cyberpunk movement,[8] as "the one major writer who is original and gifted )Tj
T*(to make the whole movement seem original and gifted."[39][VII] Aside from their )Tj
T*(central importance to cyberpunk and steampunk fiction, Gibson's fictional works )Tj
T*(have been hailed by space historian Dwayne A. Day as some of the best examples )Tj
T*(of space-based science fiction \(or "solar sci-fi"\), and "probably the only ones )Tj
T*(that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking".[115] )Tj
T*( Gibson's early novels were, according to The Observer, "seized upon by the )Tj
T*(emerging slacker and hacker generation as a kind of road map".[21] Through his )Tj
T*(novels, such terms as cyberspace, netsurfing, ICE, jacking in, and neural )Tj
T*(implants entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, )Tj
T*(virtual interaction and "the matrix".[117] In "Burning Chrome" \(1982\), he )Tj
T*(coined the term cyberspace,[V] referring to the "mass consensual hallucination" )Tj
T*(of computer networks.[118] Through its use in Neuromancer, the term gained such )Tj
T*(recognition that it became the de facto term for the World Wide Web during the )Tj
T*(1990s.[119] Artist Dike Blair has commented that Gibson's "terse descriptive )Tj
T*(phrases capture the moods which surround technologies, rather than their )Tj
T*(engineering."[120] )Tj
T*( Gibson's work has influenced several popular musicians: references to his )Tj
T*(fiction appear in the music of Stuart Hamm,[II]Billy Idol,[III]Warren )Tj
T*(Zevon,[IV]Deltron 3030, Straylight Run \(whose name is derived from a sequence )Tj
T*(in Neuromancer\)[121] and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced )Tj
T*(by Neuromancer,[52] and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of )Tj
T*(Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up )Tj
T*(happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the )Tj
T*(audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These )Tj
T*(Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson.[122] He returned the favour )Tj
T*(by writing an article about the band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August )Tj
T*(2005.[123] The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.[124] )Tj
T*( The film The Matrix \(1999\) drew inspiration for its title, characters and )Tj
T*(story elements from the Sprawl trilogy.[125] The characters of Neo and Trinity )Tj
T*(in The Matrix are similar to Bobby Newmark \(Count Zero\) and Molly \("Johnny )Tj
T*(Mnemonic", Neuromancer\).[87] Like Turner, protagonist of Gibson's Count Zero, )Tj
T*(characters in The Matrix download instructions \(to fly a helicopter and to )Tj
T*("know kung fu", respectively\) directly into their heads, and both Neuromancer )Tj
T*(and The Matrix feature artificial intelligences which strive to free themselves )Tj
T*(from human control.[87] Critics have identified marked similarities between )Tj
T*(Neuromancer and the film's cinematography and tone.[126] In spite of his )Tj
T*(initial reticence about seeing the film on its release,[26] Gibson later )Tj
T*(described it as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."[1] In 2008 he )Tj

T*( Observers contend that Gibson's influence on the development of the Web )Tj
T*(reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography )Tj
T*(for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the )Tj
T*(mainstream.[29] Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the )Tj
T*("meatpuppet", and is credited with inventingâ€”conceptually rather than )Tj
T*(participatorallyâ€”the phenomenon of virtual sex.[133] His influence on early )Tj
T*(pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged,[134] and he )Tj
T*(holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design.[135]Steven )Tj
T*(Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the "conceptual )Tj
T*(foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in )Tj
T*(video games and the Web".[63] In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of )Tj
T*(Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of )Tj
T*(cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet \(and the Web )Tj
T*(particularly\) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, )Tj
T*(asking "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?"[136] )Tj
T*( Gibson scholar Tatiani G. Rapatzikou has commented, in Gothic Motifs in the )Tj
T*(Fiction of William Gibson, on the origin of the notion of cyberspace: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Gibson's vision, generated by the monopolising appearance of the terminal image )Tj
T*(and presented in his creation of the cyberspace matrix, came to him when he saw )Tj
T*(teenagers playing in video arcades. The physical intensity of their postures, )Tj
T*(and the realistic interpretation of the terminal spaces projected by these )Tj
T*(gamesÂ â€“ as if there were a real space behind the screenâ€”made apparent the )Tj
T*(manipulation of the real by its own representation.[137])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In his Sprawl and Bridge trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the )Tj
T*(few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the )Tj
T*(sociospatial structuring of cities.[138] Not all responses to Gibson's visions )Tj
T*(have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce, though )Tj
T*(acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that "no other writer had so )Tj
T*(eloquently and emotionally effected the direction of the hacker )Tj
T*(community,"[139] dismissed them as "adolescent fantasies of violence and )Tj
T*(disembodiment."[140] In Pattern Recognition, the plot revolves around snippets )Tj
T*(of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. )Tj
T*(Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, )Tj
T*(methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 )Tj
T*(lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion )Tj
T*(that the creators of lonelygirl15 drew influence from him.[141] Another )Tj
T*(phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of reality television,[10] for )Tj

T*(Coen brothers. Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young )Tj
T*(New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a movie studio in )Tj
T*(Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next )Tj
T*(door at the run-down Hotel Earle. )Tj
T*( The Coens wrote the screenplay in three weeks while experiencing difficulty )Tj
T*(during the writing of another film, Miller's Crossing. Soon after Miller's )Tj
T*(Crossing was finished, the Coens began filming Barton Fink, which had its )Tj
T*(premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, Barton Fink )Tj
T*(won the Palme d'Or, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor )Tj
T*(\(Turturro\). Although it was celebrated almost universally by critics and )Tj
T*(nominated for three Academy Awards, the movie grossed only $6,000,000 at the )Tj
T*(box office, two-thirds of its estimated budget. )Tj
T*( The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two )Tj
T*(prominent themes of Barton Fink. The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that )Tj
T*(of Broadway, and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high )Tj
T*(culture and low culture. Other themes in the film include fascism and World War )Tj
T*(II; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; and how )Tj
T*(intellectuals relate to "the common man". Because of its diverse elements, )Tj
T*(Barton Fink has defied efforts at genre classification. It has been variously )Tj
T*(referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a KÃ¼nstlerroman, and a buddy film. )Tj
T*( The feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story, and )Tj
T*(careful deliberation went into its design. There is a sharp contrast between )Tj
T*(Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, )Tj
T*(especially the home of Jack Lipnick. On the wall of Fink's room there hangs a )Tj
T*(single picture of a woman at the beach; this captures Barton's attention, and )Tj
T*(the image reappears in the final scene of the film. Although the picture and )Tj
T*(other elements of the film \(including a mysterious box given to Fink by )Tj
T*(Charlie\) appear laden with symbolism, critics disagree over their possible )Tj
T*(meanings. The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while )Tj
T*(denying an attempt to communicate some holistic message. )Tj
T*( The film contains allusions to many real-life people and events, most notably )Tj
T*(the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner. The characters of Barton Fink )Tj
T*(and W.P. Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men, but )Tj
T*(the Coens stress important differences. They have also admitted to parodying )Tj
T*(film magnates like Louis B. Mayer, but they note that Fink's agonizing )Tj
T*(tribulations in Hollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences. )Tj
T*( Barton Fink was influenced by several earlier works, including the films of )Tj
T*(Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion \(1965\) and The Tenant \(1976\). Other )Tj
T*(influences are Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Preston Sturges's Sullivan's )Tj
T*(Travels. The movie also contains a number of literary allusions, to works by )Tj
T*(William Shakespeare, John Keats, and Flannery O'Connor. There are also )Tj
T*(religious overtones, including references to the Book of Daniel, King )Tj
T*(Nebuchadnezzar, and Bathsheba. )Tj
T*( Barton Fink \(John Turturro\) is enjoying the success of his first Broadway )Tj
T*(play, Bare Ruined Choirs. His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in )Tj
T*(Hollywood has offered a thousand dollars per week to write movie scripts. )Tj
T*(Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from )Tj
T*("the common man", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and )Tj

T*(checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room )Tj
T*(is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting )Tj
T*(of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. )Tj
T*( In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick \(Michael Lerner\), )Tj
T*(Barton explains that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is \(as )Tj
T*(Lipnick says\) "less Hollywood".[1] Lipnick promises that his only concern is )Tj
T*(Barton's writing ability, and assigns his new employee to a wrestling movie. )Tj
T*(Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by )Tj
T*(sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to )Tj
T*(complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows \(John Goodman\), is the source of the )Tj
T*(noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a )Tj
T*(hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for "the )Tj
T*(common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, )Tj
T*(Barton falls asleep, but is awoken by the incessant whine of a mosquito. )Tj
T*( Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Barton consults )Tj
T*(producer Ben Geisler \(Tony Shalhoub\) for advice. Irritated, the frenetic )Tj
T*(Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to speak with another writer for )Tj
T*(assistance. While in the bathroom, Barton meets the novelist William Preston )Tj
T*(\(W.P.\) "Bill" Mayhew \(John Mahoney\), who is vomiting in the next stall. They )Tj
T*(briefly discuss movie writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. )Tj
T*(When Barton arrives, Mayhew is drunk and yelling wildly. His secretary, Audrey )Tj
T*(Taylor \(Judy Davis\), reschedules the meeting and confesses to Barton that she )Tj
T*(and Mayhew are in love. When they finally meet for lunch, Mayhew, Audrey, and )Tj
T*(Barton discuss writing and drinking. Before long Mayhew argues with Audrey, )Tj
T*(slaps her, and wanders off, drunk. Rejecting Barton's offer of consolation, she )Tj
T*(explains that she feels sorry for Mayhew, since he is married to another woman )Tj
T*(who is "disturbed". )Tj
T*( With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton )Tj
T*(phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and )Tj
T*(after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they are assumed to )Tj
T*(have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When he wakes up the )Tj
T*(next morning, he, again, hears the sound of the mosquito, finds it on Audrey's )Tj
T*(back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, he turns her onto her )Tj
T*(side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the )Tj
T*(night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is )Tj
T*(repulsed, but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the )Tj
T*(police. After a surreal meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton )Tj
T*(tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to )Tj
T*(New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to )Tj
T*(watch it. )Tj
T*( Soon afterwards, Barton is visited by two police detectives, who inform him )Tj
T*(that Charlie's real name is in fact Karl Mundt â€” "Madman Mundt".[3] He is a )Tj
T*(serial killer wanted for several murders; after shooting his victims, they )Tj
T*(explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns to )Tj
T*(his room and examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he )Tj
T*(begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of )Tj
T*(celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, )Tj
T*(after handcuffing him to the bed, then reveal Mayhew's murder. Charlie appears, )Tj
T*(and the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming, )Tj
T*(Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie )Tj
T*(speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame Barton )Tj
T*(is cuffed to, then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he has paid )Tj
T*(a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in Lower Manhattan. Barton leaves the )Tj
T*(hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to )Tj
T*(telephone his parents, but there is no answer. )Tj
T*( In a final meeting, a disappointed and betrayed Lipnick, now uniformed as he )Tj
T*(attempts to secure an Army reserve commission, angrily chastises Barton for )Tj
T*(writing "a fruity movie about suffering",[4] then informs him that he is to )Tj

T*( [edit] Background and writing )Tj
T*( In 1989, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen began writing the script for a movie )Tj
T*(eventually released as Miller's Crossing. The many threads of the story became )Tj
T*(complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the )Tj
T*(process.[5] Although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer's )Tj
T*(block,[6] the Coen brothers rejected this description. "It's not really the )Tj
T*(case that we were suffering from writer's block," Joel said in a 1991 )Tj
T*(interview, "but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a )Tj
T*(certain distance from Miller's Crossing."[7] They went from Los Angeles to New )Tj
T*(York and began work on a different project.[8] )Tj
T*( In three weeks, the Coens wrote a script with a title role written )Tj
T*(specifically for actor John Turturro, with whom they'd been working on Miller's )Tj
T*(Crossing. The new movie, Barton Fink, was set in a large, seemingly-abandoned )Tj
T*(hotel.[7] This setting, which they named the Hotel Earle, was a driving force )Tj
T*(behind the story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film )Tj
T*(Blood Simple in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a )Tj
T*(significant impression: "We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being )Tj
T*(condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world."[10] )Tj
T*( The writing process for Barton Fink was smooth, they said, suggesting that the )Tj
T*(relief of being away from Miller's Crossing may have been a catalyst. They also )Tj
T*(felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story, which helped them move )Tj
T*(quickly through the composition. "Certain films come entirely in one's head; we )Tj
T*(just sort of burped out Barton Fink."[11] While writing, the Coens created a )Tj
T*(second leading role with another actor in mind: John Goodman, who had appeared )Tj
T*(in their 1987 comedy Raising Arizona. His new character, Charlie, was Barton's )Tj
T*(next-door neighbor in the cavernous hotel.[12] Even before writing, the Coens )Tj
T*(knew how the story would end, and wrote Charlie's final speech at the start of )Tj
T*(the writing process.[13] )Tj
T*( The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: )Tj
T*("Barton Fink sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and )Tj
T*(finish Miller's Crossing."[14] Once production of the first movie was finished, )Tj
T*(the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward )Tj
T*(to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to )Tj
T*(coordinate views on the project: "I felt I could bring something more human to )Tj
T*(Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a )Tj
T*(little further than they expected."[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( As they designed detailed storyboards for Barton Fink, the Coens began looking )Tj
T*(for a new cinematographer, since their associate Barry SonnenfeldÂ â€“ who had )Tj
T*(filmed their first three moviesÂ â€“ was occupied with his own directorial debut, )Tj
T*(The Addams Family. The Coens had been impressed with the work of English )Tj
T*(cinematographer Roger Deakins, particularly the interior scenes of the 1988 )Tj
T*(movie Stormy Monday. After screening other films he had worked on \(including )Tj
T*(Sid and Nancy and Pascali's Island\), they sent a script to Deakins and invited )Tj
T*(him to join the project. His agent advised against working with the Coens, but )Tj
T*(Deakins met with them at a cafe in Notting Hill and they soon began working )Tj
T*(together on Barton Fink.[16] )Tj
T*( Filming began in June 1990 and took eight weeks \(a third less time than )Tj
T*(required by Miller's Crossing\), and the estimated final budget for the movie )Tj
T*(was US$9 million.[17] The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily )Tj
T*(translated their ideas for each scene onto film. "There was only one moment we )Tj
T*(surprised him," Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a )Tj
T*(tracking shot out of the bedroom and into a sink drain "plug hole" in the )Tj
T*(adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. "The shot was a lot of fun )Tj
T*(and we had a great time working out how to do it," Joel said. "After that, )Tj

T*(every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow )Tj
T*(and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'"[18] )Tj
T*( Three weeks of filming were spent in the Hotel Earle, a set created by art )Tj
T*(director Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in )Tj
T*(the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in )Tj
T*(post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built )Tj
T*(a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series )Tj
T*(of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated )Tj
T*(for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead )Tj
T*(catwalk opened each jet, giving the impression of a fire racing ahead of )Tj
T*(Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway )Tj
T*(\(sans fire\) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes.[17] The )Tj
T*(final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing )Tj
T*(against a rock.[12] )Tj
T*( The Coens edited the movie themselves, as is their custom. "We prefer a )Tj
T*(hands-on approach," Joel explained in 1996, "rather than sitting next to )Tj
T*(someone and telling them what to cut."[19] Because of rules for membership in )Tj
T*(film production guilds, they are required to use a pseudonym; "Roderick Jaynes" )Tj
T*(is credited with editing Barton Fink.[20] Only a few filmed scenes were removed )Tj
T*(from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from )Tj
T*(New York to Hollywood. \(In the movie, this is shown enigmatically with a wave )Tj
T*(crashing against a rock.\) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios )Tj
T*(were also filmed, but edited out because they were "too conventional".[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Setting )Tj
T*( The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the )Tj
T*(Coens' conception of the movie. "We wanted an art deco stylization," Joel )Tj
T*(explained in a 1991 interview, "and a place that was falling into ruin after )Tj
T*(having seen better days."[22] Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two )Tj
T*(large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a )Tj
T*("ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other )Tj
T*(passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes )Tj
T*(are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other )Tj
T*(inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms.[23] Joel said: "You can imagine )Tj
T*(it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry )Tj
T*(alone in their rooms."[22] Heat and moisture are other important elements of )Tj
T*(the setting. The wallpaper in Barton's room peels and droops; Charlie )Tj
T*(experiences the same problem, and guesses heat is the cause. The Coens used )Tj
T*(green and yellow colors liberally in designing the hotel "to suggest an aura of )Tj
T*(putrefaction".[22] )Tj
T*( The atmosphere of the hotel was meant to connect with the character of )Tj
T*(Charlie. As Joel explained: "Our intention, moreover, was that the hotel )Tj
T*(function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman. The )Tj
T*(sweat drips off his forehead like the paper peels off the walls. At the end, )Tj
T*(when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that this is )Tj
T*(like some kind of hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already )Tj
T*(suggested something infernal."[22] The peeling wallpaper and the paste which )Tj
T*(seeps through it also mirror Charlie's chronic ear infection and the resultant )Tj
T*(pus.[24] )Tj
T*( When Barton first arrives at the Hotel Earle, he is asked by the friendly )Tj
T*(bellhop Chet \(Steve Buscemi\) if he is "a trans or a res"Â â€“ transient or )Tj
T*(resident. Barton explains that he isn't sure, but will be staying )Tj
T*("indefinitely".[25] The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests )Tj
T*(reappears several times, notably in the hotel's motto, "A day or a lifetime", )Tj
T*(which Barton notices on the room's stationery. This idea returns at the end of )Tj
T*(the movie, when Charlie describes Barton as "a tourist with a typewriter". His )Tj
T*(ability to leave the Earle \(while Charlie remains\) is presented by critic Erica )Tj
T*(Rowell as evidence that Barton's story represents the process of writing )Tj
T*(itself. Barton, she says, represents an author who is able to leave a story, )Tj
T*(while characters like Charlie cannot.[24] )Tj
T*( In contrast, the offices of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick's house are pristine, )Tj

T*(lavishly decorated, and extremely comfortable. The company's rooms are bathed )Tj
T*(in sunlight, and Ben Geisler's office faces a lush array of flora. Barton meets )Tj
T*(Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous, spotless swimming pool. This echoes )Tj
T*(his position as studio head, as he explains: "...you can't always be honest, )Tj
T*(not with the sharks swimming around this townÂ ... if I'd been totally honest, I )Tj
T*(wouldn't be within a mile of this poolÂ â€“ unless I was cleaning it."[26] In his )Tj
T*(office, Lipnick showcases another trophy of his power: statues of Atlas, the )Tj
T*(Titan of Greek mythology who declared war on the gods of Mount Olympus and was )Tj
T*(severely punished.[27] )Tj
T*( Barton watches dailies from another wrestling movie being made by Capitol )Tj
T*(Pictures; the date on the clapperboard is 9 December, two days after the attack )Tj
T*(on Pearl Harbor. Later, when Barton celebrates the completed script by dancing )Tj
T*(at a USO show, he is surrounded by soldiers.[28] In Lipnick's next appearance, )Tj
T*(he wears a colonel's uniform, which is really a costume from his company. )Tj
T*(Lipnick has not actually entered the military, but declares himself ready to )Tj
T*(fight the "little yellow bastards".[29] Originally, this historical moment just )Tj
T*(after the United States entered World War II was to have a significant impact )Tj
T*(on the Hotel Earle. As the Coens explained: "[W]e were thinking of a hotel )Tj
T*(where the lodgers were old people, the insane, the physically handicapped, )Tj
T*(because all the others had left for the war. The further the script was )Tj
T*(developed, the more this theme got left behind, but it had led us, in the )Tj
T*(beginning, to settle on that period."[30] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Picture )Tj
T*( The picture in Barton's room of a woman at the beach is a central focus for )Tj
T*(both the character and camera. He examines it frequently while at his desk, and )Tj
T*(after finding Audrey's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is )Tj
T*(repeated at the end of the film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an )Tj
T*(identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her )Tj
T*(beauty, he asks her: "Are you in pictures?" She blushes and replies: "Don't be )Tj
T*(silly."[33] )Tj
T*( The Coens decided early in the writing process to include the picture as a key )Tj
T*(element in the room. "Our intention," Joel explained later, "was that the room )Tj
T*(would have very little decoration, that the walls would be bare and that the )Tj
T*(windows would offer no view of any particular interest. In fact, we wanted the )Tj
T*(only opening on the exterior world to be this picture. It seemed important to )Tj
T*(us to create a feeling of isolation."[34] )Tj
T*( Later in the film, Barton places into the frame a small picture of Charlie, )Tj
T*(dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The juxtaposition of his )Tj
T*(neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of the )Tj
T*(woman on the beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. )Tj
T*(Critic Michael Dunne notes: "[V]iewers can only wonder how 'real' Charlie is.Â )Tj
T*(... In the film's final shotÂ ... viewers must wonder how 'real' [the woman] is. )Tj
T*(The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How )Tj
T*(real are films anyway?"[35] )Tj
T*( The picture's significance has been the subject of broad speculation. )Tj
T*(Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, )Tj
T*(the final scene "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up )Tj
T*(coda".[36] In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell )Tj
T*(suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low )Tj
T*(culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture \(speeches to the )Tj
T*(contrary notwithstanding\). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton )Tj
T*(himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera )Tj
T*(moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension )Tj
T*(between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the )Tj
T*(film, when Barton finds himselfÂ â€“ in a senseÂ â€“ inside the picture.[37] )Tj
T*( Critic M. Keith Booker calls the final scene an "enigmatic comment on )Tj
T*(representation and the relationship between art and reality". He suggests that )Tj
T*(the identical images point to the absurdity of art which reflects life )Tj
T*(directly. The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality, prompting )Tj
T*(confusion in the viewer; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore )Tj

T*(leads inevitably to uncertainty.[38] )Tj
T*( The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although )Tj
T*(they refer to their first movie, Blood Simple, as a relatively straightforward )Tj
T*(example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising )Tj
T*(Arizona, without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a )Tj
T*(comedy, but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls "a )Tj
T*(pretty savage film".[39] Their third film, Miller's Crossing, reversed this )Tj
T*(order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts )Tj
T*(single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and )Tj
T*(political satire.[40] )Tj
T*( This trend of mixing movie types continued and intensified with Barton Fink; )Tj
T*(the Coens insist the film "does not belong to any genre".[2] Ethan has )Tj
T*(described it as "a buddy movie for the '90s".[41] It contains elements of )Tj
T*(comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present.[42] Actor )Tj
T*(Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story,[41] while literature )Tj
T*(professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a KÃ¼nstlerroman, )Tj
T*(highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer.[43] )Tj
T*(Critic Donald Lyons describes the movie as "a retro-surrealist vision".[44] )Tj
T*( Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists )Tj
T*(straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an )Tj
T*(example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says )Tj
T*(the movie renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise )Tj
T*(accuracy. This technique, he notes, is "typical of postmodern film, which views )Tj
T*(the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to )Tj
T*(be raided for material".[45] In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls )Tj
T*(Barton Fink a "postmodern pastiche" which closely examines how past eras have )Tj
T*(represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours, a 2002 movie about )Tj
T*(Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far )Tj
T*(from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He )Tj
T*(quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: The kind of postmodernism exhibited in )Tj
T*(these films "does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether )Tj
T*(we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains".[46] )Tj
T*( Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the )Tj
T*(writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the )Tj
T*(studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit movies; the resulting collision )Tj
T*(produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism.[47] The Coens' )Tj
T*(cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, )Tj
T*(the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its )Tj
T*(drain. Rowell calls this a "postmodern update" of the notorious sexually )Tj
T*(suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred )Tj
T*(Hitchcock in his 1959 movie North by Northwest.[48] )Tj
T*( Barton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood )Tj
T*(and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits )Tj
T*(roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This )Tj
T*(motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's )Tj
T*(claim that his job is to "plumb the depths" while writing.[37] His first )Tj
T*(experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges )Tj
T*(from beneath the floor, suggesting the real activity is underground. Although )Tj
T*(Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the )Tj
T*(elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elementsÂ â€“ combined with )Tj
T*(many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violenceÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that "the whole )Tj

T*(Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink )Tj
T*(represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking )Tj
T*(shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th )Tj
T*(century.[52] )Tj
T*( From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view )Tj
T*(of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the )Tj
T*(camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the )Tj
T*(audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, )Tj
T*(he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. )Tj
T*(This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.[53] )Tj
T*( The shifting point of view coincides with the movie's subject matter: )Tj
T*(filmmaking. The movie begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the )Tj
T*(process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's )Tj
T*(focus in the first scene on Barton \(who is mouthing the words spoken by actors )Tj
T*(offscreen\), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: "[T]hough we listen )Tj
T*(to one scene, we watch another.Â ... The separation of sound and picture shows a )Tj
T*(crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the )Tj
T*(protagonist \(his play\) and the world outside it \(what goes in to creating a )Tj
T*(performance\)."[54] )Tj
T*( The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the )Tj
T*(probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word "head" )Tj
T*(appears sixty times in the original screenplay.[55] In a grim nod to later )Tj
T*(events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his "job" of selling )Tj
T*(insurance: "Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other )Tj
T*(people."[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Symbolism )Tj
T*( Much has been written about the symbolic meanings of Barton Fink. Rowell )Tj
T*(proposes that it is "a figurative head swelling of ideas that all lead back to )Tj
T*(the artist".[56] The proximity of the sex scene to Audrey's murder prompts )Tj
T*(Lyons to insist: "Sex in Barton Fink is death."[57] Others have suggested that )Tj
T*(the second half of the movie is an extended dream sequence.[31] )Tj
T*( The Coens, however, have denied any intent to create a systematic unity from )Tj
T*(symbols in the film. "We never, ever go into our films with anything like that )Tj
T*(in mind," Joel said in a 1998 interview. "There's never anything approaching )Tj
T*(that kind of specific intellectual breakdown. It's always a bunch of )Tj
T*(instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason."[58] The Coens have )Tj
T*(noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity. Ethan said in 1991: "Barton Fink )Tj
T*(does end up telling you what's going on to the extent that it's important to )Tj
T*(knowÂ ... What isn't crystal clear isn't intended to become crystal clear, and )Tj
T*(it's fine to leave it at that."[59] Regarding fantasies and dream sequences, he )Tj
T*(said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(It is correct to say that we wanted the spectator to share in the interior life )Tj
T*(of Barton Fink as well as his point of view. But there was no need to go too )Tj
T*(far. For example, it would have been incongruous for Barton Fink to wake up at )Tj
T*(the end of the film and for us to suggest thereby that he actually inhabited a )Tj
T*(reality greater than what is depicted in the film. In any case, it is always )Tj
T*(artificial to talk about "reality" in regard to a fictional character.[31])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The homoerotic overtones of Barton's relationship with Charlie are not )Tj
T*(unintentional. Although one detective demands to know if they had "some sick )Tj
T*(sex thing", their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant, and cloaked in )Tj
T*(conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward )Tj
T*(his neighbor, for example, comes in the form of a standard pick-up line: "I'd )Tj
T*(feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a )Tj
T*(drink."[60] The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an )Tj
T*(example of homoerotic affection. "We consider that a sex scene," Joel Coen said )Tj
T*(in 2001.[61] )Tj

T*(Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and )Tj
T*(pleasant. By contrast, the eerie sustained bell of the Hotel Earle rings )Tj
T*(endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it.[62] The nearby rooms of )Tj
T*(the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted )Tj
T*(unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental )Tj
T*(state, and punctuate Charlie's claim that "I hear everything that goes on in )Tj
T*(this dump".[48] The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of )Tj
T*(Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashingÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.[63] )Tj
T*( Another symbolic sound is the hum of a mosquito. Although his producer insists )Tj
T*(that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles \(since "mosquitos breed in )Tj
T*(swamps; this is a desert"[65]\), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as )Tj
T*(Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at )Tj
T*(meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently )Tj
T*(into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her )Tj
T*(corpse, and suddenly realizes she's been murdered. The high pitch of the )Tj
T*(mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie's score.[66] )Tj
T*(During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who )Tj
T*(expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.[64] )Tj
T*( The score was composed by Carter Burwell, who has worked with the Coens since )Tj
T*(their first movie. Unlike earlier projects, howeverÂ â€“ the Irish folk tune used )Tj
T*(for Miller's Crossing and an American folk song as the basis for Raising )Tj
T*(ArizonaÂ â€“ Burwell wrote the music for Barton Fink without a specific )Tj
T*(inspiration.[67] The score was released in 1996 on a compact disc, combined )Tj
T*(with the score for the Coens' film Fargo.[68] )Tj
T*( Several songs used in the movie are laden with meaning. At one point Mayhew )Tj
T*(stumbles away from Barton and Audrey, drunk. As he wanders, he hollers the folk )Tj
T*(song "Old Black Joe". Composed by Stephen Foster, it tells the tale of an )Tj
T*(elderly slave preparing to join his friends in "a better land". Mayhew's )Tj
T*(rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of )Tj
T*(Capitol Pictures; it foreshadows Barton's own situation at the movie's end.[69] )Tj
T*( When he finishes writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a USO )Tj
T*(show. The song used in this scene is a rendition of "Down South Camp Meeting", )Tj
T*(a swing tune. Its lyrics \(unheard in the movie\) state: "Git ready \(Sing\) / Here )Tj
T*(they come! The choir's all set." These lines echo the title of Barton's play, )Tj
T*(Bare Ruined Choirs. As the celebration erupts into a melee, the intensity of )Tj
T*(the music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a )Tj
T*(trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera's zoom into a sink drain just before )Tj
T*(Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sources, inspirations, and allusions )Tj
T*( Inspiration for the film came from several sources, and it contains allusions )Tj
T*(to many different people and events. At one point in the picnic scene, as )Tj
T*(Mayhew wanders drunkenly away from Barton and Audrey, he calls out: "Silent )Tj
T*(upon a peak in Darien!" This is the last line from John Keats's 1816 sonnet "On )Tj
T*(First Looking into Chapman's Homer". The literary reference not only )Tj
T*(demonstrates the character's knowledge of classic texts, but the poem's )Tj
T*(reference to the Pacific Ocean matches Mayhew's announcement that he will "jus' )Tj
T*(walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'llÂ ... improvise".[70] )Tj
T*( The title of Barton's play, Bare Ruined Choirs, comes from line four of Sonnet )Tj
T*(73 by William Shakespeare. The poem's focus on aging and death connects to the )Tj
T*(movie's exploration of artistic difficulty.[71] Other academic allusions are )Tj
T*(presented elsewhere, often with extreme subtlety. For example, a brief shot of )Tj
T*(the title page in a Mayhew novel indicates the publishing house of "Swain and )Tj
T*(Pappas". This is likely a reference to Marshall Swain and George Pappas, )Tj
T*(philosophers whose work focuses on themes explored in the movie, including the )Tj
T*(limitations of knowledge and nature of being.[72] One critic notes that )Tj
T*(Barton's fixation on the stain across the ceiling of his hotel room matches the )Tj
T*(protagonist's behavior in the short story "The Enduring Chill" by author )Tj
T*(Flannery O'Connor.[73] )Tj

T*(Wolfgang von Goethe \(through the presence of Faustian bargains\).[74] )Tj
T*(Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters, like those in )Tj
T*(the novels of Franz Kafka, appear in the film, but the Coens insist the )Tj
T*(connection was not intended. "I have not read him since college," admitted Joel )Tj
T*(in 1991, "when I devoured works like The Metamorphosis. Others have mentioned )Tj
T*(The Castle and "In the Penal Colony", but I've never read them."[75] )Tj
T*( [edit] Clifford Odets )Tj
T*( The character of Barton Fink is based loosely on Clifford Odets, a playwright )Tj
T*(from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of )Tj
T*(dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. )Tj
T*(Their work emphasized social issues, and employed Stanislavski's system of )Tj
T*(acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of )Tj
T*(Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! )Tj
T*(and Waiting for Lefty \(both in 1935\). When public tastes turned away from )Tj
T*(politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, )Tj
T*(Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and )Tj
T*(spent twenty years writing film scripts.[76] )Tj
T*( The Coens wrote with Odets in mind; they imagined Barton Fink as "a serious )Tj
T*(dramatist, honest, politically engaged, and rather naive".[78] As Ethan said in )Tj
T*(1991: "It seemed natural that he comes from Group Theater and the decade of the )Tj
T*(thirties."[78] Like Odets, Barton believes that the theatre should celebrate )Tj
T*(the trials and triumphs of everyday people; like Barton, Odets was highly )Tj
T*(egotistical.[79] In the movie, a review of Barton's play Bare Ruined Choirs )Tj
T*(indicates that his characters face a "brute struggle for existenceÂ ... in the )Tj
T*(most squalid corners". This wording is similar to the comment of biographer )Tj
T*(Gerald Weales that Odets' characters "struggle for life amidst petty )Tj
T*(conditions".[72] Lines of dialogue from Barton's work are reminiscent of Odets' )Tj
T*(play Awake and Sing!. For example, one character declares: "I'm awake now, )Tj
T*(awake for the first time." Another says: "Take that ruined choir. Make it )Tj
T*(sing."[80] )Tj
T*( However, many important differences exist between the two men. Joel Coen said: )Tj
T*("Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes, but their )Tj
T*(personalities were quite different. Odets was much more of an extrovert; in )Tj
T*(fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood, and this is not the case with )Tj
T*(Barton Fink!"[78] Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New )Tj
T*(York, Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood. Several of his later )Tj
T*(plays were adaptedÂ â€“ by him and othersÂ â€“ into movies. One of these, The Big )Tj
T*(Knife, matches Barton's life much more than Odets'. In it, an actor becomes )Tj
T*(overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him, and eventually )Tj
T*(commits suicide.[81] Another similarity to Odets' work is Audrey's death, which )Tj
T*(mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn, a 1946 film noir written by Odets. In that )Tj
T*(film, a character wakes to find that the woman he bedded the night before has )Tj
T*(been inexplicably murdered.[82] )Tj
T*( Odets chronicled his difficult transition from Broadway to Hollywood in his )Tj
T*(diary, published in 1988 as The Time Is Ripe: The 1940 Journal of Clifford )Tj
T*(Odets. The diary explored Odets' philosophical deliberations about writing and )Tj
T*(romance. He often invited women into his apartment, and describes many of his )Tj
T*(affairs in the diary. These experiences, like the extended speeches about )Tj
T*(writing, are echoed in Barton Fink when Audrey visits and seduces Barton at the )Tj
T*(Hotel Earle.[83] Turturro was the only member of the production who read Odets' )Tj
T*(Journal, however, and the Coen brothers urge audiences to "take account of the )Tj
T*(difference between the character and the man".[78] )Tj
T*( [edit] William Faulkner )Tj
T*( Some similarities exist between the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist )Tj
T*(William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of )Tj
T*(Southern literature, and later worked in the movie business. Like Faulkner, )Tj
T*(Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood.[78] )Tj
T*(Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, )Tj
T*(which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: "I )Tj

T*(read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling )Tj
T*(picture.... That was part of what got us going on the whole Barton Fink )Tj
T*(thing."[84] Faulkner worked on a 1932 wrestling film called Flesh, which )Tj
T*(starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing.[85] The focus on )Tj
T*(wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in )Tj
T*(high school.[84] )Tj
T*( However, the Coens disavow a significant connection between Faulkner and )Tj
T*(Mayhew, calling the similarities "superficial".[78] "As far as the details of )Tj
T*(the character are concerned," Ethan said in 1991, "Mayhew is very different )Tj
T*(from Faulkner, whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all."[78] )Tj
T*(Unlike Mayhew's inability to write due to drink and personal problems, Faulkner )Tj
T*(continued to pen novels after working in the movie business, winning several )Tj
T*(awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood.[86] )Tj
T*( [edit] Jack Lipnick )Tj
T*( Lerner's Academy Award-nominated character of studio mogul Jack Lipnick is a )Tj
T*(composite of several Hollywood producers, including Harry Cohn, Louis B. Mayer, )Tj
T*(and Jack WarnerÂ â€“ three of the most powerful men in the film industry at the )Tj
T*(time in which Barton Fink is set.[87] Like Mayer, Lipnick is originally from )Tj
T*(the Belarusian capital city Minsk. When World War II broke out, Warner pressed )Tj
T*(for a position in the military and ordered his wardrobe department to create a )Tj
T*(military uniform for him; Lipnick does the same in his final scene. Warner once )Tj
T*(referred to writers as "schmucks with Underwoods", leading to Barton's use in )Tj
T*(the film of an Underwood typewriter.[88] )Tj
T*( At the same time, the Coens stress that the labyrinth of deception and )Tj
T*(difficulty Barton endures is not based on their own experience. Although Joel )Tj
T*(has said that artists tend to "meet up with Philistines", he added: "Barton )Tj
T*(Fink is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in Hollywood )Tj
T*(has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair."[22] )Tj
T*(Ethan has suggested that LipnickÂ â€“ like the men on which he is basedÂ â€“ is in )Tj
T*(some ways a product of his time. "I don't know that that kind of character )Tj
T*(exists anymore. Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that )Tj
T*(now."[89] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cinema )Tj
T*( The Coens have acknowledged several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. )Tj
T*(Chief among these are three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: )Tj
T*(Repulsion \(1965\), Cul-de-Sac \(1966\), and The Tenant \(1976\). These movies employ )Tj
T*(a mood of psychological uncertainty, coupled with eerie environments that )Tj
T*(compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his )Tj
T*(room at the Hotel Earle is frequently compared to that of Trelkovsky in his )Tj
T*(apartment in The Tenant.[90] Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: )Tj
T*("[I]t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything )Tj
T*(else."[63] By coincidence, Polanski was the head of the jury at the Cannes Film )Tj
T*(Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink first premiered. This created an awkward )Tj
T*(situation. "Obviously," Joel Coen said later, "we have been influenced by his )Tj
T*(films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because )Tj
T*(we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up."[2] )Tj
T*( Other works cited as influences for Barton Fink include Stanley Kubrick's 1980 )Tj
T*(film The Shining and the 1941 comedy Sullivan's Travels, written and directed )Tj
T*(by Preston Sturges.[91] Set in an empty hotel, Kubrick's movie concerns a )Tj
T*(writer unable to proceed with his latest work. Although the Coens approve of )Tj
T*(comparisons to The Shining, Joel suggests that Kubrick's film "belongs in a )Tj
T*(more global sense to the horror film genre".[2]Sullivan's Travels, released the )Tj
T*(year in which Barton Fink is set, follows successful director John Sullivan, )Tj
T*(who decides to create a movie of deep social importÂ â€“ not unlike Barton's )Tj
T*(desire to create entertainment for "the common man". Sullivan eventually )Tj
T*(decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for filmmakers, similar to )Tj
T*(Jack Lipnick's assertion at the end of Barton Fink that "the audience wants to )Tj
T*(see action, adventure".[92] )Tj
T*( Additional allusions to films and film history abound in Barton Fink. At one )Tj
T*(point a character discusses "Victor Soderberg"; the name is a reference to )Tj

T*(Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m, a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name )Tj
T*(Victor Seastrom.[93] Charlie's line about how his troubles "don't amount to a )Tj
T*(hill of beans" is a probable homage to the 1942 film Casablanca. Another )Tj
T*(similarity is that of Barton Fink's beach scene to the final moment in 1960's )Tj
T*(La Dolce Vita, wherein a young woman's final line of dialogue is obliterated by )Tj
T*(the noise of the ocean.[94] The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has )Tj
T*(also been compared to the living spaces in Key Largo \(1948\) and Sunset )Tj
T*(Boulevard \(1950\).[63] )Tj
T*( [edit] Themes )Tj
T*( Two of the film's central themesÂ â€“ the culture of entertainment production and )Tj
T*(the writing processÂ â€“ are intertwined and relate specifically to the )Tj
T*(self-referential nature of the work \(as well as the work within the work\). It )Tj
T*(is a movie about a man who writes a movie based on a play, and at the centre of )Tj
T*(Barton's entire opus is Barton himself. The dialogue in his play Bare Ruined )Tj
T*(Choirs \(also the first lines of the film, some of which are repeated at the end )Tj
T*(of the film as lines in Barton's screenplay The Burlyman\) give us a glimpse )Tj
T*(into Barton's self-descriptive art. The mother in the play is named "Lil", )Tj
T*(which is later revealed to be the name of Barton's own mother. In the play, )Tj
T*("The Kid" \(a representation of Barton himself\) refers to his home "six flights )Tj
T*(up"Â â€“ the same floor where Barton resides at the Hotel Earle. Moreover, the )Tj
T*(characters' writing processes in Barton Fink reflect important differences )Tj
T*(between the culture of entertainment production in New York's Broadway district )Tj
T*(and Hollywood.[95] )Tj
T*( [edit] Broadway and Hollywood )Tj
T*( Although Barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create "a new, )Tj
T*(living theater, of and about and for the common man," he does not recognize )Tj
T*(that such a theater has already been created: the movies. In fact, he disdains )Tj
T*(this authentically popular form.[96] On the other hand, the world of Broadway )Tj
T*(theatre in Barton Fink is a place of high culture, where the creator believes )Tj
T*(most fully that his work embodies his own values. Although he pretends to )Tj
T*(disdain his own success, Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with )Tj
T*(Bare Ruined Choirs. He seeks praise; when his agent Garland asks if he's seen )Tj
T*(the glowing review in the Herald, Barton says "no", even though his producer )Tj
T*(had just read it to him. Barton feels close to the theatre, confident that it )Tj
T*(can help him create work that honors "the common man". The men and women who )Tj
T*(funded the productionÂ â€“ "those people", as Barton calls themÂ â€“ demonstrate that )Tj
T*(Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood; but its intimacy and )Tj
T*(smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value.[97] )Tj
T*( Barton does not believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, )Tj
T*(Los Angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an )Tj
T*(early line of the screenplay \(filmed, but not included in the theatrical )Tj
T*(release[99]\); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent )Tj
T*(tells him: "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realismÂ )Tj
T*(â€“ if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath."[100] Later, as )Tj
T*(Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick )Tj
T*(finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is "less )Tj
T*(Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. )Tj
T*(Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of )Tj
T*(the "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity )Tj
T*(of the east coast.[28] Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a )Tj
T*(faÃ§ade. Although he begins by telling Barton that "the writer is king here at )Tj
T*(Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: "If your opinion )Tj
T*(mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and )Tj
T*(you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum."[101] )Tj
T*( Deception in Barton Fink is emblematic of Hollywood's focus on low culture, )Tj
T*(its relentless desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment for the )Tj
T*(sole purpose of economic gain. Capitol Pictures assigns Barton to write a )Tj
T*(wrestling picture with superstar Wallace Beery in the leading role. Although )Tj
T*(Lipnick declares otherwise, Geisler assures Barton that "it's just a B )Tj
T*(picture". Audrey tries to help the struggling writer by telling him: "Look, )Tj

T*(it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it."[102] )Tj
T*(This formula is made clear by Lipnick, who asks Barton in their first meeting )Tj
T*(whether the main character should have a love interest or take care of an )Tj
T*(orphaned child. Barton shows his iconoclasm by answering: "Both, maybe?"[103] )Tj
T*(In the end, his inability to conform to the studio's norms destroys Barton. A )Tj
T*(similar depiction of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West's 1939 novel The Day )Tj
T*(of the Locust, which many critics see as an important precursor to Barton )Tj
T*(Fink.[104] Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter )Tj
T*(reduced to work decorating movie sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and )Tj
T*(exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for )Tj
T*(profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under the )Tj
T*(oppressive industrial machine of the movie studio.[105] )Tj
T*( [edit] Writing )Tj
T*( The movie contains further self-referential material, as a film about a writer )Tj
T*(having difficulty writing \(written by the Coen brothers while they were having )Tj
T*(difficulty writing another project\). Barton is trapped between his own desire )Tj
T*(to create meaningful art and the need of Capitol Pictures to use its standard )Tj
T*(conventions to earn profits.[103] Audrey's advice about following the formula )Tj
T*(would save Barton if he heeded it. He does not, but when he puts the mysterious )Tj
T*(package on his writing desk, she may be helping him posthumously, in other )Tj
T*(ways.[106] The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with )Tj
T*(Mayhew's scripts, Barton Fink contains a "good wrestler" \(Barton, it seems\) and )Tj
T*(a "bad wrestler" \(Charlie\) who "confront" each other at the end. But in typical )Tj
T*(Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in )Tj
T*(fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his "common man" neighbor. )Tj
T*(By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts )Tj
T*(the "simple morality tales" and "road maps" offered to Barton as easy paths for )Tj
T*(the writer to follow.[107] )Tj
T*( However, the filmmakers point out that Barton Fink is not meant to represent )Tj
T*(the Coens themselves. "Our life in Hollywood has been particularly easy", they )Tj
T*(once said. "The film isn't a personal comment."[108] Still, universal themes of )Tj
T*(the creative process are explored throughout the movie. During the picnic )Tj
T*(scene, for example, Mayhew asks Barton: "Ain't writin' peace?" Barton pauses, )Tj
T*(then says: "No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner )Tj
T*(pain."[109] Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call Barton Fink )Tj
T*("an autobiography of the life of the Coens' minds, not of literal fact".[110] )Tj
T*( [edit] Fascism )Tj
T*( Several of the film's elements, including the setting at the start of World )Tj
T*(War II, have led some critics to highlight parallels to the rise of fascism at )Tj
T*(the time. For example, the detectives who visit Barton at the Hotel Earle are )Tj
T*(named "Mastrionatti" and "Deutsch"[111]Â â€“ Italian and German names, evocative )Tj
T*(of the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Their contempt for Barton )Tj
T*(is clear: "Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?Â ... I didn't think this dump )Tj
T*(was restricted."[112] Later, just before killing his last victim, Charlie says )Tj
T*("Heil Hitler".[113] Jack Lipnick hails originally from the Belarusian capital )Tj
T*(city Minsk, which was occupied from 1941 by the Nazis, following Operation )Tj
T*(Barbarossa.[114] )Tj
T*( "[I]t's not forcing the issue to suggest that the Holocaust hovers over Barton )Tj
T*(Fink", writes biographer Ronald Bergan.[50] Others see a more specific message )Tj
T*(in the film, particularly Barton's obliviousness to Charlie's homicidal )Tj
T*(tendencies. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended )Tj
T*(to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. "They paint Fink as an )Tj
T*(ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling )Tj
T*(himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks he understands the 'common man' )Tj
T*(but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive )Tj
T*(appeal." However, he goes on to say: "It would be a mistake to insist too much )Tj
T*(on this aspect of the movie...."[116] )Tj
T*( Other critics are more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: )Tj

T*(intellectuals like him were too busy pursuing their own selfish interests to )Tj
T*(effectively oppose the rise of fascism, a point that is historically entirely )Tj
T*(inaccurateÂ ... That the Coens would choose to level a charge of )Tj
T*(irresponsibility against the only group in America that actively sought to )Tj
T*(oppose the rise of fascism is itself highly irresponsible and shows a complete )Tj
T*(ignorance of \(or perhaps lack of interest in\) historical reality. Such )Tj
T*(ignorance and apathy, of course, are typical of postmodern film....[45])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( For their part, the Coens deny any intention to present an allegorical )Tj
T*(message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but "we just wanted )Tj
T*(them to be representative of the Axis world powers at the time. It just seemed )Tj
T*(kind of amusing. It's a tease. All that stuff with CharlieÂ â€“ the "Heil Hitler!" )Tj
T*(businessÂ â€“ sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease."[58] In 2001 Joel )Tj
T*(responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive )Tj
T*(analysis: "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we )Tj
T*(may have encouraged itÂ â€“ like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is )Tj
T*(intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing."[117] )Tj
T*( [edit] Slavery )Tj
T*( Although subdued in dialogue and imagery, the theme of slavery appears several )Tj
T*(times in the movie. Mayhew's crooning of the spiritual tune "Old Black Joe" )Tj
T*(depicts him as enslaved to the movie studio, not unlike the song's narrator who )Tj
T*(pines for "my friends from the cotton fields away".[118] One brief shot of the )Tj
T*(door to Mayhew's workspace shows the title of the movie he is supposedly )Tj
T*(writing: Slave Ship. This is a reference to a 1937 movie written by Mayhew's )Tj
T*(inspiration William Faulkner and starring Wallace Beery, for whom Barton is )Tj
T*(composing a script in the movie.[118] )Tj
T*( The symbol of the slave ship is furthered by specific set designs, including )Tj
T*(the round window in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a porthole, as well as )Tj
T*(the walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of )Tj
T*(a watercraft.[118] Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that )Tj
T*(Barton has become a slave to the studio: "[T]he contents of your head," )Tj
T*(Lipnick's assistant tells him, "are the property of Capitol Pictures".[119] )Tj
T*(After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal )Tj
T*(punishment: "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And )Tj
T*(Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write."[4] This contempt and )Tj
T*(control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in )Tj
T*(Hollywood at the time.[118][120] As Arthur Miller said in his review of Barton )Tj
T*(Fink: "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication )Tj
T*(of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated."[121] )Tj
T*( [edit] "The Common Man" )Tj
T*( During the first third of the film, Barton speaks constantly of his desire to )Tj
T*(lionise "the common man" in his work. In one speech he declares: "The hopes and )Tj
T*(dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of )Tj
T*(lifeÂ â€“ why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be )Tj
T*(a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real )Tj
T*(theater. Call it our theater."[122] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is )Tj
T*(totally unable \(or unwilling\) to appreciate the humanity of the "common man" )Tj
T*(living next door to him.[122] Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has )Tj
T*(brought various horrors upon him because "you DON'T LISTEN!"[123] In his first )Tj
T*(conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is )Tj
T*(saying "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine )Tj
T*(words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, )Tj
T*(Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears )Tj
T*(with cotton to block the sound of his ringing telephone.[124] )Tj
T*( Barton's position as screenwriter is of particular consequence to his )Tj
T*(relationship with "the common man". By refusing to listen to his neighbor, )Tj
T*(Barton cannot validate Charlie's existence in his writingÂ â€“ with disastrous )Tj
T*(results. Not only is Charlie stuck in a job which demeans him, but he cannot )Tj
T*(\(at least in Barton's case\) have his story told.[125] More centrally, the film )Tj
T*(traces the evolution of Barton's understanding of "the common man": At first he )Tj

T*(is an abstraction to be lauded from a vague distance. Then he becomes a complex )Tj
T*(individual with fears and desires. Finally he shows himself to be a powerful )Tj
T*(individual in his own right, capable of extreme forms of destruction and )Tj
T*(therefore feared and/or respected.[126] )Tj
T*( The complexity of "the common man" is also explored through the oft-mentioned )Tj
T*("life of the mind". While expounding on his duty as a writer, Barton drones: "I )Tj
T*(gotta tell you, the life of the mindÂ ... There's no road map for that territoryÂ )Tj
T*(... and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know )Tj
T*(anything about."[127] Barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative )Tj
T*(considerations while Charlie is not. This delusion shares the film's climax, as )Tj
T*(Charlie runs through the hallway of the Earle, shooting the detectives with a )Tj
T*(shotgun and screaming: "LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE )Tj
T*(MIND!!"[128] Charlie's "life of the mind" is no less complex than Barton's; in )Tj
T*(fact, some critics consider it more so.[129] )Tj
T*( Charlie's understanding of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he )Tj
T*(asks Barton about "the two lovebirds next door", despite the fact that they are )Tj
T*(several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: )Tj
T*("Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or )Tj
T*(somethin'."[130] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the )Tj
T*(kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This )Tj
T*(theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: "Most guys I just feel )Tj
T*(sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going )Tj
T*(through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to )Tj
T*(help them out."[131][132] )Tj
T*( [edit] Religion )Tj
T*( Themes of religious salvation and allusions to Biblical texts appear only )Tj
T*(briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is )Tj
T*(experiencing his most desperate moment of confusion and despair, he opens the )Tj
T*(drawer of his desk and finds a Gideon's Holy Bible. He opens it "randomly" to )Tj
T*(Chapter 2 in the Book of Daniel, and reads from it: "And the king, )Tj
T*(Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if )Tj
T*(ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be )Tj
T*(cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."[133] This passage )Tj
T*(reflects Barton's inability to make sense of his own experiences \(wherein )Tj
T*(Audrey has been "cut in pieces"\), as well as the "hopes and dreams" of "the )Tj
T*(common man".[72]Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives )Tj
T*(to Barton as a "little entertainment" to "divert you in your sojourn among the )Tj
T*(Philistines".[134] )Tj
T*( Mayhew alludes to "the story of Solomon's mammy", a reference to Bathsheba, )Tj
T*(who gave birth to Solomon after her lover David had her husband Uriah killed. )Tj
T*(Although Audrey cuts Mayhew off by praising his book \(which Audrey herself may )Tj
T*(have written\), the reference foreshadows the love triangle which evolves among )Tj
T*(the three characters of Barton Fink. Rowell points out that Mayhew is murdered )Tj
T*(\(presumably by Charlie\) soon after Barton and Audrey have sex.[135] Another )Tj
T*(Biblical reference comes when Barton flips to the front of the Bible in his )Tj
T*(desk drawer, and sees his own words transposed into the Book of Genesis. This )Tj
T*(is seen as a representation of his hubris as self-conceived omnipotent master )Tj
T*(of creation, or alternatively as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating Barton's )Tj
T*(hallucinatory state of mind.[135] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating )Tj
T*(competition which included Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's )Tj
T*(Jungle Fever and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three )Tj
T*(awards: Best Director, Best Actor, and the top prize of Palme d'Or.[136] This )Tj
T*(sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some )Tj
T*(critics felt that the jury was too generous to the exclusion of other worthy )Tj
T*(entries.[137] Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would )Tj
T*(undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each )Tj
T*(movie to a maximum of two awards.[137]Barton Fink was also nominated for three )Tj

T*(Lerner lost to Jack Palance for his role in City Slickers; the awards for Art )Tj
T*(Direction and Costume Design went to Bugsy.[139] The film was also nominated )Tj
T*(for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.[140] )Tj
T*( Barton Fink was an overwhelming critical success. The movie-review aggregator )Tj
T*(site Rotten Tomatoes lists a 91% favorable rating on its "Tomatometer" \(based )Tj
T*(on 46 reviews\). The aggregator Metacritic lists a 69% favorable rating, based )Tj
T*(on 19 published reviews. The Washington Post critic Rita Kempley described )Tj
T*(Barton Fink as "certainly one of the year's best and most intriguing )Tj
T*(films".[141]The New York Times critic Vincent Canby called it "an unqualified )Tj
T*(winner" and "a fine dark comedy of flamboyant style and immense though )Tj
T*(seemingly effortless technique".[142] Critic Jim Emerson called Barton Fink )Tj
T*("the Coen brothers' most deliciously, provocatively indescribable picture )Tj
T*(yet".[143] )Tj
T*( Some critics disliked the abstruse plot and deliberately enigmatic ending. )Tj
T*(Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum warned of the Coens' "adolescent )Tj
T*(smarminess and comic-book cynicism", and described Barton Fink as "a )Tj
T*(midnight-movie gross-out in Sunday-afternoon art-house clothing".[144] In a )Tj
T*(1994 interview, Joel dismissed criticism of unclear elements in their films: )Tj
T*("People have a problem dealing with the fact that our movies are not )Tj
T*(straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be )Tj
T*(about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the )Tj
T*(real world...."[145] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, )Tj
T*(despite its uncertain conclusion. Writing in USA Today, he said: "The ending is )Tj
T*(something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it )Tj
T*(worked."[146] )Tj
T*( The movie opened in the United States on eleven screens on August 23, 1991, )Tj
T*(and earned $268,561 during its opening weekend. During its theatrical release, )Tj
T*(Barton Fink grossed $6,153,939 in the United States.[147] That the movie failed )Tj
T*(to recoup the expenses of production amused film producer Joel Silver, whom the )Tj
T*(Coens would later work with in The Hudsucker Proxy: "I don't think it made $5 )Tj
T*(million, and it cost $9 million to make. [The Coen brothers have] a reputation )Tj
T*(for being weird, off-center, inaccessible."[148] The film was released in VHS )Tj
T*(home video format on August 18, 1993,[149] and a DVD edition was made available )Tj
T*(on May 20, 2003. The DVD contains a gallery of still photos, theatrical )Tj
T*(trailers, and eight deleted scenes.[150] The film is available on Blu-ray Disc )Tj
T*(in the UK in a 5-movie Coen Brothers collection, however this collection is )Tj
T*(region-free and will work in any Blu-ray player. )Tj
T*( [edit] Possible sequel )Tj
T*( The Coen brothers have stated that they are interested in making a sequel to )Tj
T*(Barton Fink called Old Fink. The film would take place in the 1960s, around the )Tj
T*(same time period as the Coens' A Serious Man. "It's the summer of love and )Tj
T*([Fink is] teaching at Berkeley. He ratted on a lot of his friends to the House )Tj
T*(Un-American Activities committee," said Joel Coen. The brothers have stated )Tj
T*(that they have had talks with John Turturro about reprising his role as Fink, )Tj
T*(but they are waiting "until he was actually old enough to play the part."[151] )Tj
T*(Speaking to the Onion A.V. Club in June 2011, Turturro suggested that the )Tj
T*(sequel would be set in the 1970s and Fink would be a hippie with a large )Tj
T*(Jewfro.[152] He also said that youâ€™ll have to wait another 10 years for that, )Tj

T*(The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English )Tj
T*(Dictionary since 2001. )Tj
T*( Homer is one of the most influential fictional characters on television, )Tj
T*(having been described by the British newspaper The Sunday Times as "the )Tj
T*(greatest comic creation of [modern] time". He was named the greatest fictional )Tj
T*(character "of the last 20 years" in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked )Tj
T*(the second greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was )Tj
T*(voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For )Tj
T*(voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding )Tj
T*(Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer )Tj
T*(and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. )Tj
T*( [edit] Role in The Simpsons )Tj
T*( Homer Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and )Tj
T*(Maggie Simpson.[1] He is the son of Mona and Abraham Simpson. Homer has held )Tj
T*(over 188 different jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons.[2] In most )Tj
T*(episodes, he works as the Nuclear Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear )Tj
T*(Power Plant, a position he has held since "Homer's Odyssey", the third episode )Tj
T*(of the series.[3] At the plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten )Tj
T*(by his boss Mr. Burns, and constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. )Tj
T*(Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant )Tj
T*(because of the potential for Homer to get cancer.[4] Each of his other jobs has )Tj
T*(lasted only one episode. In the first half of the series, the writers developed )Tj
T*(an explanation about how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in )Tj
T*(every episode. In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without )Tj
T*(any mention of his regular employment.[5] )Tj
T*( The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not )Tj
T*(physically age, and, as such, the show is generally assumed to be set in the )Tj
T*(current year. Nevertheless, in several episodes, events in Homer's life have )Tj
T*(been linked to specific time periods.[1] "Mother Simpson" \(season seven, 1995\) )Tj
T*(depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in the )Tj
T*(mid-1960s following a run-in with the law;[6] "The Way We Was" \(season two, )Tj
T*(1991\) shows Homer falling in love with Marge Bouvier as a senior at Springfield )Tj
T*(High School in the 1970s;[7] and "I Married Marge" \(season three, 1991\) implies )Tj
T*(that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980.[8] However, the episode "That )Tj
T*('90s Show" \(season 19, 2008\) contradicted much of this backstory, portraying )Tj
T*(Homer and Marge as a childless couple in the early 1990s.[9] )Tj
T*( Homer's age has changed as the series developed; he was 36 in the early )Tj
T*(episodes,[10] 38 and 39 in season eight,[11] and 40 in the eighteenth )Tj
T*(season,[12] although even in those seasons his age is inconsistent. [1] During )Tj
T*(Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein's period as showrunners, they found that as they )Tj
T*(aged, Homer seemed to become older too, so they increased his age to 38.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Character )Tj
T*( [edit] Creation )Tj
T*( Matt Groening conceived Homer and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in )Tj
T*(the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called in to )Tj
T*(pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended )Tj
T*(to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that )Tj
T*(animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, )Tj
T*(Groening decided to go in another direction,[14] and hurriedly sketched out his )Tj
T*(version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his )Tj
T*(own family. Homer was named after Groening's father.[14][15] Very little else )Tj
T*(of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind )Tj
T*(Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son )Tj
T*(Homer.[16][17] According to Groening, "Homer originated with my goal to both )Tj
T*(amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an )Tj
T*(athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had )Tj
T*(in common with Homer was a love of donuts"[18] Although Groening has stated in )Tj
T*(several interviews that Homer's namesake is his father, he also claimed in )Tj
T*(several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The )Tj
T*(Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer.[1][19][20] Homer's )Tj

T*(characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky )Tj
T*(and Bullwinkle Show who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.[22][23] )Tj
T*( Homer made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in )Tj
T*(The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night".[24] In 1989, the shorts were adapted )Tj
T*(into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. )Tj
T*(Homer and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.[25] )Tj
T*( [edit] Design )Tj
T*( The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in )Tj
T*(silhouette.[26] The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted )Tj
T*(basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, )Tj
T*(they just traced over his drawings.[14] Homer's physical features are generally )Tj
T*(not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters )Tj
T*(other than Homer, Lenny, and Krusty the Clown have a similar beard line.[27] )Tj
T*(When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the )Tj
T*(character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear )Tj
T*(resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and )Tj
T*(redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' )Tj
T*(when he draws pictures of Homer for fans.[28] The basic shape of Homer's head )Tj
T*(is described by director Mark Kirkland as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad )Tj
T*(bowl on top. Bart's head is also coffee-can shaped, while spheres are used for )Tj
T*(Marge, Lisa, and Maggie.[29] During the shorts, the animators experimented with )Tj
T*(the way Homer would move his mouth when talking. At one point, his mouth would )Tj
T*(stretch out back "beyond his beardline"; but this was dropped when it got "out )Tj
T*(of control."[30] In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than )Tj
T*(sharply pointed because animation director Wes Archer felt it should look )Tj
T*(disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed.[31] During the )Tj
T*(first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small )Tj
T*(lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and )Tj
T*(they were eventually dropped.[31] )Tj
T*( In the season seven \(1995\) episode "Treehouse of Horror VI", Homer was )Tj
T*(computer animated into a three dimensional character for the first time for the )Tj
T*("Homer3" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors at Pacific )Tj
T*(Data Images worked hard not to "reinvent the character".[32] In the final )Tj
T*(minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action Los )Tj
T*(Angeles. The scene was directed by David Mirkin and was the first time a )Tj
T*(Simpsons character had been in the real world in the series.[32] Because )Tj
T*("Lisa's Wedding" \(season six, 1995\) is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's )Tj
T*(design was altered to make him older in the episode. He is heavier; one of the )Tj
T*(hairs on top of his head was removed; and an extra line was placed under the )Tj
T*(eye. A similar design has been used in subsequent flashforwards.[33] )Tj
T*( Homer's voice is performed by Dan Castellaneta, who voices numerous other )Tj
T*(characters, including Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, )Tj
T*(Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta had been part )Tj
T*(of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some )Tj
T*(voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Voices were needed )Tj
T*(for the Simpsons shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and )Tj
T*(fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more )Tj
T*(actors.[34][35] In the shorts and first few seasons of the half-hour show, )Tj
T*(Homer's voice is different from the majority of the series. The voice began as )Tj
T*(a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not "get enough )Tj
T*(power behind that voice",[35] and could not sustain his Matthau impression for )Tj
T*(the nine- to ten-hour-long recording sessions and had to find something )Tj
T*(easier.[2] During the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, )Tj
T*(Castellaneta "dropped the voice down"[34] and developed it as more versatile )Tj
T*(and humorous, allowing Homer a fuller range of emotions.[36] )Tj
T*( Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's.[37] To )Tj
T*(perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest[35] and is )Tj
T*(said to "let his I.Q. go".[38] While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of )Tj
T*(Homer's least intelligent comments,[38] such as the line "I am so smart, )Tj

T*(s-m-r-t" from "Homer Goes to College" \(season five, 1993\) which was a genuine )Tj
T*(mistake made by Castellaneta during recording.[39] Castellaneta likes to stay )Tj
T*(in character during recording sessions,[40] and he tries to visualize a scene )Tj
T*(so that he can give the proper voice to it.[41] Despite Homer's fame, )Tj
T*(Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, "except, maybe, by a )Tj
T*(die-hard fan".[40] )Tj
T*( "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" \(season five, 1993\) is the only episode where )Tj
T*(Homer's voice was provided by someone other than Castellaneta. The episode )Tj
T*(features Homer forming a barbershop quartet called The Be Sharps; and, at some )Tj
T*(points, his singing voice is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans.[42] The )Tj
T*(Dapper Dans had recorded the singing parts for all four members of The Be )Tj
T*(Sharps. Their singing was intermixed with the normal voice actor's voices, )Tj
T*(often with a regular voice actor singing the melody and the Dapper Dans )Tj
T*(providing backup.[43] )Tj
T*( Until 1998, Castellaneta was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in )Tj
T*(1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, )Tj
T*(going as far as preparing for casting of new voices.[44] However, the dispute )Tj
T*(was soon resolved and he received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the )Tj
T*(voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.[44] The issue was )Tj
T*(resolved a month later,[45] and Castellaneta earned $250,000 per episode.[46] )Tj
T*(After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately )Tj
T*($400,000 per episode.[47] Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the )Tj
T*(series unless production costs were cut, Castellaneta and the other cast )Tj
T*(members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per )Tj
T*(episode.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Character development )Tj
T*( Executive producer Al Jean notes that in The Simpsons' writing room, "everyone )Tj
T*(loves writing for Homer", and many of his adventures are based on experiences )Tj
T*(of the writers.[49] In the early seasons of the show, Bart was the main focus. )Tj
T*(But, around the fourth season, Homer became more of the focus. According to )Tj
T*(Matt Groening, this was because "With Homer, thereâ€™s just a wider range of )Tj
T*(jokes you can do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homerâ€™s )Tj
T*(stupidity. Thereâ€™s only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted )Tj
T*(Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court as an adult. )Tj
T*(But Homer is an adult, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is )Tj
T*(launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to )Tj
T*(him."[18] )Tj
T*( Homer's behavior has changed a number of times through the run of the series. )Tj
T*(He was originally "very angry" and oppressive toward Bart, but these )Tj
T*(characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further )Tj
T*(explored.[50] In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was )Tj
T*(going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious )Tj
T*(about how he was perceived by others.[51] In the first several years, Homer was )Tj
T*(often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as )Tj
T*(executive producer \(seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001\), he became more of "a )Tj
T*(boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf".[52] Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, "under )Tj
T*(Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once )Tj
T*(would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset [...] now end )Tj
T*(with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck."[53] Fans have dubbed )Tj
T*(this incarnation of the character "Jerkass Homer".[54][55][56] At voice )Tj
T*(recording sessions, Dan Castellaneta has rejected material written in the )Tj
T*(script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is )Tj
T*("boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose."[57] When editing )Tj
T*(The Simpsons Movie, several scenes were changed or otherwise toned down to make )Tj
T*(Homer more sympathetic.[58] )Tj
T*( The writers have made Homer's intelligence appear to decline over the years; )Tj
T*(they explain this was not done intentionally, but it was necessary to top )Tj
T*(previous jokes.[59] For example, in "When You Dish Upon a Star", \(season 10, )Tj
T*(1998\) the writers included a scene where Homer admits that he cannot read. The )Tj
T*(writers debated including this plot twist because it would contradict previous )Tj

T*(scenes in which Homer does read, but eventually they decided to keep the joke )Tj
T*(because they found it humorous. The writers often debate how far to go in )Tj
T*(portraying Homer's stupidity; one suggested rule is that "he can never forget )Tj
T*(his own name".[60] )Tj
T*( [edit] Personality )Tj
T*( The comic efficacy of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of )Tj
T*(stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He has a low intelligence )Tj
T*(level and is described by director David Silverman as "creatively brilliant in )Tj
T*(his stupidity".[61] Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is )Tj
T*(overweight, and "is devoted to his stomach".[61] His short attention span is )Tj
T*(evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and )Tj
T*(enterprises, only to "change ... his mind when things go badly".[61] Homer )Tj
T*(often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in )Tj
T*(the episode "Duffless" \(season four, 1993\) as a full-blown alcoholic.[62] He is )Tj
T*(very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily )Tj
T*(enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish )Tj
T*(manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short "Family )Tj
T*(Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only )Tj
T*(strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation,[63] because doing so )Tj
T*("seems sadistic. If we keep it that heâ€™s ruled by his impulses, then he can )Tj
T*(easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, )Tj
T*(he also gives up fairly easily."[18] Another of the original ideas entertained )Tj
T*(by Groening was that Homer would "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to )Tj
T*(strangle him back", but this was dropped.[64] Homer shows no compunction about )Tj
T*(expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people )Tj
T*(outside the family.[61] While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all )Tj
T*(sorts of mayhem in Springfield, these events usually result from a lack of )Tj
T*(foresight or his intense temper, matched with his impulsivity, rather than any )Tj
T*(malice. Except for expressing annoyance at Ned Flanders, Homer's destructive )Tj
T*(actions are usually unintentional. )Tj
T*( Homer has complex relationships with all three of his children. He often )Tj
T*(berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies; )Tj
T*(some episodes, particularly in later seasons, show that the pair have a strange )Tj
T*(respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities )Tj
T*(and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, )Tj
T*(does everything he can to help her. While Homer's thoughtless antics often )Tj
T*(upset his family, he has also revealed himself to be a caring father and )Tj
T*(husband: in "Lisa the Beauty Queen", \(season four, 1992\) he sold his cherished )Tj
T*(ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so )Tj
T*(she could feel better about herself;[10] in "Rosebud", \(season five, 1993\) he )Tj
T*(gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy )Tj
T*(bear;[65] in "Radio Bart", \(season three, 1992\) he spearheaded an attempt to )Tj
T*(dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well;[66] and in "A Milhouse Divided", )Tj
T*(\(season eight, 1996\) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make )Tj
T*(up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony.[67] Homer, however, has a poor )Tj
T*(relationship with his father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson, whom he placed in a )Tj
T*(nursing home as soon as he could.[68] The Simpson family will often do their )Tj
T*(best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of )Tj
T*(love for his father from time to time.[69] )Tj
T*( Homer is "a \(happy\) slave to his various appetites",[70] and would gladly sell )Tj
T*(his soul to the devil in exchange for a single doughnut.[71] He has an )Tj
T*(apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge )Tj
T*(about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the )Tj
T*(United States,[72]Incan mythology,[73]bankruptcy law,[74] and cell biology.[75] )Tj
T*(Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer )Tj
T*(and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a )Tj
T*(low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary "Simpson )Tj

T*(although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding )Tj
T*(and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing )Tj
T*(his intelligence to return to its previous level.[78] Homer often debates with )Tj
T*(his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving )Tj
T*(him dubious advice, sometimes helping him make the right decisions, but often )Tj
T*(failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through )Tj
T*(sound effects, walked out on him,[79] Homer's conversations with his brain were )Tj
T*(used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after )Tj
T*(the producers "used every possible permutation".[80] These exchanges were often )Tj
T*(introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work )Tj

T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( [edit] Commendations )Tj
T*( Homer's influence on comedy and culture has been significant. In 2010, )Tj
T*(Entertainment Weekly named Homer "the greatest character of the last 20 )Tj
T*(years."[81] He was placed second on TV Guide's 2002 Top 50 Greatest Cartoon )Tj
T*(Characters, behind Bugs Bunny;[82] fifth on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters, )Tj
T*(one of only four cartoon characters on that list;[83] and first in a Channel 4 )Tj
T*(poll of the greatest television characters of all time.[84] In 2007, )Tj
T*(Entertainment Weekly placed Homer ninth on their list of the "50 Greatest TV )Tj
T*(icons" and first on their 2010 list of the "Top 100 Characters of the Past )Tj
T*(Twenty Years".[85][86][87] Homer was also the runaway winner in British polls )Tj
T*(that determined who viewers thought was the "greatest American"[88] and which )Tj
T*(fictional character people would like to see become the President of the United )Tj
T*(States.[89] His relationship with Marge was included in TV Guide's list of "The )Tj
T*(Best TV Couples of All Time".[90] )Tj
T*( Dan Castellaneta has won several awards for voicing Homer, including four )Tj
T*(Primetime Emmy Awards for "Outstanding Voice-Over Performance" in 1992 for )Tj
T*("Lisa's Pony", 1993 for "Mr. Plow",[91] in 2004 for "Today I Am a Clown",[92] )Tj
T*(and in 2009 for "Father Knows Worst".[93] Although in the case of "Today I Am a )Tj
T*(Clown", it was for voicing "various characters" and not solely for Homer.[92] )Tj
T*(In 2010, Castellaneta received a fifth Emmy nomination for voicing Homer and )Tj
T*(Grampa in the episode "Thursdays with Abie".[94] In 1993, Castellaneta was )Tj
T*(given a special Annie Award, "Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field )Tj
T*(of Animation", for his work as Homer on The Simpsons.[95][96] In 2004, )Tj
T*(Castellaneta and Julie Kavner \(the voice of Marge\) won a Young Artist Award for )Tj
T*("Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series".[97] In 2005, Homer and Marge were )Tj
T*(nominated for a Teen Choice Award for "Choice TV Parental Units".[98] Various )Tj
T*(episodes in which Homer is strongly featured have won Emmy Awards for )Tj
T*(Outstanding Animated Program, including "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th )Tj
T*(Commandment" in 1991, "Lisa's Wedding" in 1995, "Homer's Phobia" in 1997, )Tj
T*("Trash of the Titans" in 1998, "HOMR" in 2001, "Three Gays of the Condo" in )Tj
T*(2003 and "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind" in 2008.[91] In 2000, Homer )Tj
T*(and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of )Tj
T*(Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.[99] )Tj
T*( [edit] Analysis )Tj
T*( Homer Simpson is an "everyman" and embodies several American stereotypes of )Tj
T*(working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy and )Tj
T*(a borderline alcoholic.[1] Matt Groening describes him as "completely ruled by )Tj
T*(his impulses".[100] Dan Castellaneta calls him "a dog trapped in a man's body", )Tj
T*(adding, "He's incredibly loyalÂ â€“ not entirely cleanÂ â€“ but you gotta love )Tj
T*(him."[35] In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as )Tj
T*("the most American of the Simpsons" and believes that while the other Simpson )Tj
T*(family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is "pure )Tj
T*(American".[101] In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular )Tj
T*(Culture, the authors comment that "Homer's progress \(or lack thereof\) reveals a )Tj
T*(character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly."[102] )Tj

T*(analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of Aristotelian virtue ethics. )Tj
T*(Raja Halwani writes that Homer's "love of life" is an admirable character )Tj
T*(trait, "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and )Tj
T*(immorality. [...] He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge )Tj
T*(others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These )Tj
T*(qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him )Tj
T*(admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer )Tj
T*(Simpsons of this world."[103] In 2008, Entertainment Weekly justified )Tj
T*(designating The Simpsons as a television classic by stating, "we all hail )Tj
T*(Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is )Tj
T*(stunning".[104] )Tj
T*( In the season eight episode "Homer's Enemy" the writers decided to examine )Tj
T*("what it would be like to actually work alongside Homer Simpson".[105] The )Tj
T*(episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work )Tj
T*(ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the )Tj
T*(episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American )Tj
T*(spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are )Tj
T*(prominently highlighted.[106][107] By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard )Tj
T*(working and persevering "real American hero", is relegated to the role of )Tj
T*(antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged )Tj
T*(victorious.[106] )Tj
T*( In Gilligan Unbound, author Paul Arthur Cantor states that he believes Homer's )Tj
T*(devotion to his family has added to the popularity of the character. He writes, )Tj
T*("Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood. [...] This is why, for all his )Tj
T*(stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He )Tj
T*(continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in )Tj
T*(some basic and important sense that makes him a good father."[108]The Sunday )Tj
T*(Times remarked "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. )Tj
T*(When the chips are down, he always does the right thing by his childrenâ€”he is )Tj
T*(never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities."[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultural influence )Tj
T*( Homer Simpson is one of the most popular and influential television characters )Tj
T*(in a variety of standards. USA Today cited the character as being one of the )Tj
T*("top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years" in 2007, adding that )Tj
T*(Homer "epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American )Tj
T*(humor."[109]Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the )Tj
T*(Study of Popular Television believes that "three centuries from now, English )Tj
T*(professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest )Tj
T*(creations in human storytelling."[110] Animation historian Jerry Beck described )Tj
T*(Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, "you know someone like )Tj
T*(it, or you identify with \(it\). That's really the key to a classic )Tj
T*(character."[82] Homer has been described by The Sunday Times as "the greatest )Tj
T*(comic creation of [modern] time". The article remarked, "every age needs its )Tj
T*(great, consoling failure, its lovable, pretension-free mediocrity. And we have )Tj
T*(ours in Homer Simpson."[57] )Tj
T*( Homer has been cited as a bad influence on children; for example, in 2005 a )Tj
T*(survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that 59% of parents felt that )Tj
T*(Homer promoted an unhealthy lifestyle.[111] A five-year study of more than )Tj
T*(2,000 middle-aged people in France found a possible link between weight and )Tj
T*(brain function, the findings of which were dubbed the "Homer Simpson )Tj
T*(syndrome".[112] Results from a word memory test showed that people with a Body )Tj
T*(mass index \(BMI\) of 20 \(considered to be a healthy level\) remembered an average )Tj
T*(of nine out of 16 words. Meanwhile, people with a BMI of 30 \(inside the obese )Tj
T*(range\) remembered an average of just seven out of 16 words.[112] )Tj
T*( Despite Homer's embodiment of American culture, his influence has spread to )Tj
T*(other parts of the world. In 2003, Matt Groening revealed that his father, )Tj
T*(after whom Homer was named, was Canadian, and said that this made Homer himself )Tj
T*(a Canadian.[113] The character was later made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, )Tj
T*(Canada, in real life because Homer Groening was believed to be from the )Tj
T*(Manitoba capital, although sources say the senior Groening was actually born in )Tj

T*(Saskatchewan.[114] In 2007, an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne )Tj
T*(Abbas giant in Dorset, England as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie. )Tj
T*(This caused outrage among local neopagans who performed "rain magic" to try to )Tj
T*(get it washed away.[115] In 2008, a fake Spanish euro coin was found in AvilÃ©s, )Tj
T*(Spain, with the face of Homer replacing the figure of King Juan Carlos I.[116] )Tj
T*(On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 )Tj
T*(cent stamps featuring Homer and the four other members of the Simpson family. )Tj
T*(They are the first characters from a television series to receive this )Tj
T*(recognition while the show is still in production.[117] The stamps, designed by )Tj
T*(Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009.[118][119] )Tj
T*( Homer has appeared, voiced by Castellaneta, in several other television shows, )Tj
T*(including the sixth season of American Idol where he opened the show;[120]The )Tj
T*(Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he performed a special animated opening )Tj
T*(monologue for the July 24, 2007, edition;[121] and the 2008 fundraising )Tj
T*(television special Stand Up to Cancer where he was shown having a )Tj
T*(colonoscopy.[122] )Tj
T*( Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", is typically uttered when he )Tj
T*(injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something )Tj
T*(bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording )Tj
T*(session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was )Tj
T*(written in the script as an "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a )Tj
T*(drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed )Tj
T*(Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used )Tj
T*(the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word "Damn!" Matt Groening felt )Tj
T*(that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. )Tj
T*(Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered "D'oh!"[123] The first )Tj
T*(intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short "The Krusty the Clown )Tj
T*(Show",[123] \(1989\) and its first usage in the series was in the series )Tj
T*(premiere, "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".[124] )Tj
T*( "D'oh!" was first added to The New Oxford Dictionary of English in 1998. It is )Tj
T*(defined as an interjection "used to comment on an action perceived as foolish )Tj
T*(or stupid".[125] In 2001, "D'oh!" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary, )Tj
T*(without the apostrophe.[126] The definition of the word is "expressing )Tj
T*(frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as )Tj
T*(planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish".[127] In 2006, )Tj
T*("D'oh!" was placed in sixth position on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest )Tj
T*(television catchphrases.[128][129] "D'oh!" is also included in The Oxford )Tj
T*(Dictionary of Quotations.[130] The book includes several other quotations from )Tj
T*(Homer, including "Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The )Tj
T*(lesson is never try", from "Burns' Heir" \(season five, 1994\) as well as "Kids )Tj
T*(are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they )Tj
T*(practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all", from "Eight )Tj
T*(Misbehavin'" \(season 11, 1999\). Both quotes entered the dictionary in August )Tj
T*(2007.[131] )Tj
T*( [edit] Merchandising )Tj
T*( Homer's inclusion in many Simpsons publications, toys, and other merchandise )Tj
T*(is evidence of his enduring popularity. The Homer Book, about Homer's )Tj
T*(personality and attributes, was released in 2004 and is commercially )Tj
T*(available.[132][133] It has been described as "an entertaining little book for )Tj
T*(occasional reading"[134] and was listed as one of "the most interesting books )Tj
T*(of 2004" by The Chattanoogan.[135] Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Region and districts )Tj
T*( Amador Valley High School, originally Amador Valley Joint Union High )Tj
T*(School,[3] was named for its location in the Amador Valley \(part of the )Tj
T*(Tri-Valley area of the San Francisco East Bay\). The valley's namesake was a )Tj
T*(wealthy Californio rancher, Don JosÃ© MarÃ­a Amador.[4] The school was founded on )Tj
T*(March 14, 1922, as part of the Amador Valley Joint Union High School District )Tj
T*(\(AVJUHSD\), out of concerns of overcrowding and transportation for students )Tj
T*(traveling to nearby Livermore High School. Amador Valley's first class )Tj
T*(graduated in 1923.[5][6] )Tj
T*( From 1922 to 1988, the school was part of the AVJUHSD.[3][7] Originally this )Tj
T*(district also taught students from nearby Dublin and served the local rural )Tj
T*(community.[8] In the late 1930s, the Amador Theater was built towards the front )Tj
T*(of the Amador Valley High School campus. The theater hosted school plays, band )Tj
T*(concerts, performances, lectures, and assemblies, and was the former home of )Tj
T*(the successful community theater group Cask and Mask, now known as The )Tj
T*(Masquers.[9] The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 led to the building of a )Tj
T*(series of freeways in the region, which led to increased population and an )Tj
T*(increase in student enrollment.[10][11] )Tj
T*( In 1988, voters approved the unification of several school districts in the )Tj
T*(region. On July 1, 1988, the AVJUHSD merged with the Pleasanton Joint School )Tj
T*(District to form the Pleasanton Unified School District.[12][13] As of 2009, )Tj
T*(the district contained two comprehensive high schools \(Amador Valley and )Tj
T*(Foothill\), two continuation high schools \(Horizon and Village\), three middle )Tj
T*(schools, seven elementary schools, and an adult education program.[14] )Tj
T*( The school grounds are bordered on the east and southeast by Santa Rita Road, )Tj
T*(a Union Pacific railroad track on which the Altamont Commuter Express runs, and )Tj
T*(Arroyo del Valle.[15] To the north are several businesses and residential )Tj
T*(districts lie on the western border. The school is the launch point for the )Tj
T*(annual Pleasanton Hometown Holidays Celebration Parade and the annual Fall )Tj
T*(Festival Parade, a part of the Alameda County Fair since the 1940s. The Fall )Tj
T*(Festival parade, which features bands, floats, balloons, horses, and antique )Tj
T*(cars, starts on the Amador Valley parking lot, travels down Main Street, and )Tj
T*(ends near the fairgrounds.[16][17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Court battle )Tj
T*( In 1978, the AVJUHSD challenged the constitutionality of California )Tj
T*(PropositionÂ 13, which placed a cap on county real estate taxes. The proposition )Tj
T*(limited property tax assessments to the 1975 standard, eliminating $7 billion )Tj
T*(of the $11.4 billion in property tax revenue collected each year. According to )Tj
T*(the Washington Post, the "severe" limitations this imposed on state funding )Tj
T*(forced local governments and most school districts in California to make )Tj
T*("drastic cutbacks".[18] Furthermore, an article in the Los Angeles Times noted )Tj
T*(that Federal aid money for Californian schools, worth about $98 million each )Tj
T*(year, may be reduced if state-funded programs are cut. A recent Congressional )Tj
T*(report had found that Proposition 13 would not result in any major "local )Tj
T*(spending" cuts. In order to receive Federal aid, the state needed to maintain )Tj
T*(present levels of spending on local programs or secure local matching funds. )Tj
T*(However, the enforcement of this spending was "flexible in many programs" and )Tj
T*(the Federal Impact Aid program for schools was therefore in jeopardy.[19] )Tj
T*( The district held that the measure was "so drastic and far-reaching that it )Tj
T*(was 'a revision' of the state Constitution and not a mere amendment". )Tj
T*(Ultimately, the district was unsuccessful in its suit. In their ruling, the )Tj
T*(judges distinguished between "amendment" and "revision." The court confirmed )Tj
T*(that an initiative cannot "revise" the constitution; PropositionÂ 13, however, )Tj

T*(was an amendment to the California Constitution and not a "revision".[20] In )Tj
T*(2009, Amador Valley was cited by dissenting Justice Carlos R. Moreno in arguing )Tj
T*(the non-constitutionality of California PropositionÂ 8.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Development )Tj
T*( The first class of eight students graduated in 1923, and the school quickly )Tj
T*(became known for its municipal bands and sports teams, along with their )Tj
T*(beautiful cheerleaders.[22] The school selected the Don as its mascot, in honor )Tj
T*(of the title used by Amador;[4]Don is a Spanish term used as a mark of high )Tj
T*(esteem for a distinguished nobleman or gentleman. )Tj
T*( Parents of Amador Valley students became involved with student activities. In )Tj
T*(1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program to provide )Tj
T*(students with a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, )Tj
T*(and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. )Tj
T*(The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher )Tj
T*(from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project led to the )Tj
T*(formation of a Parent-Teacher Association \(PTA\) chapter at Amador Valley in the )Tj
T*(late 1920s.[23] )Tj
T*( Much of the original Amador Valley High School building was reconstructed in )Tj
T*(1968. The following year, the school reached its maximum capacity, about 1,895Â )Tj
T*(students. To accommodate the larger student population, Dublin High School was )Tj
T*(founded. Both schools held classes on the Amador Valley campus during the )Tj
T*(1968â€“69 school year.[24] A continued influx of families to the Pleasanton )Tj
T*(region prompted the foundation of another high school, Foothill, in 1973.[5] )Tj
T*( Starting November 3 in 1986, Amador Valley teachers went on a rolling strike )Tj
T*(to "protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new contract."[26] The school )Tj
T*(brought in substitutes to replace the picketing teachers.[26] Amador Valley )Tj
T*(teachers are unionized under the California Teachers Association and the )Tj
T*(National Education Association.[27] )Tj
T*( In March 1997, the city passed Measure B, which granted the school district )Tj
T*($69 million dollars to replace old and crowded facilities and modernize the )Tj
T*(school campus.[25] The renovations revived one of the school's last original )Tj
T*(structures: the Amador Theater, the city's most popular performing arts )Tj
T*(facility.[5][9] The measure enabled the addition of renovated science )Tj
T*(classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a )Tj
T*(sound-proofed music building. The parking lot and central quad were expanded, )Tj
T*(with more than 550 parking spaces in the new lot, and classrooms were equipped )Tj
T*(to be more energy efficient.[28] )Tj
T*( In 1999, responding to a directive from the California Superintendent of )Tj
T*(Education, the district identified character education as one of its goals.[29] )Tj
T*(As selected by the community, six character traits \(responsibility, compassion, )Tj
T*(self-discipline, honesty, respect, and integrity\) were listed as "expected )Tj
T*(behaviors" for Pleasanton. In 2004, Amador Valley and the school district won )Tj
T*(national recognition \(National School of Character\) for its program emphasizing )Tj
T*(the Community of Character.[13] )Tj
T*( In 2004, a new two-story building was completed, containing twenty-four new )Tj
T*(classrooms. The following year, the Charles "Chuck" Volonte Aquatic Center was )Tj
T*(built for Amador Valley's swimming, diving, and water polo teams. Lighting )Tj
T*(retrofits were added in December 2004 for improved energy efficiency and )Tj
T*(illumination.[28] In 2005, Amador Valley High School was the first high school )Tj
T*(to join the worldwide Go Green Initiative. In the same year, Pleasanton was )Tj
T*(selected as the "Go Green City of the Year."[30] )Tj
T*( [edit] Academics )Tj
T*( As of 2012, Amador Valley operates on a 7:00Â a.m. to 3:00Â p.m. schedule. Most )Tj
T*(students do not take first period, with their schedules starting at 8:00Â a.m. )Tj

T*(longest-reigning Emperor, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, from 1520 to his death )Tj
T*(in 1566. He is known in the West as Suleiman the Magnificent[4] and in the )Tj
T*(East, as "The Lawgiver" \(Turkish: Kanuni; Arabic: Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø§Ù†ÙˆÙ†Ù‰â€Ž, alâ€QÄnÅ«nÄ«\), for his )Tj
T*(complete reconstruction of the Ottoman legal system. Suleiman became a )Tj
T*(prominent monarch of 16th century Europe, presiding over the apex of the )Tj
T*(Ottoman Empire's military, political and economic power. Suleiman personally )Tj
T*(led Ottoman armies to conquer the Christian strongholds of Belgrade, Rhodes, )Tj
T*(and most of Hungary before his conquests were checked at the Siege of Vienna in )Tj
T*(1529. He annexed most of the Middle East in his conflict with the Safavids and )Tj
T*(large swathes of North Africa as far west as Algeria. Under his rule, the )Tj
T*(Ottoman fleet dominated the seas from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and the )Tj
T*(Persian Gulf.[5] )Tj
T*( At the helm of an expanding empire, Suleiman personally instituted legislative )Tj
T*(changes relating to society, education, taxation, and criminal law. His )Tj
T*(canonical law \(or the Kanuns\) fixed the form of the empire for centuries after )Tj
T*(his death. Not only was Suleiman a distinguished poet and goldsmith in his own )Tj
T*(right; he also became a great patron of culture, overseeing the golden age of )Tj
T*(the Ottoman Empire's artistic, literary and architectural development.[6] He )Tj
T*(spoke five languages.[citation needed] )Tj
T*( In a break with Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married a harem girl, Roxelana, )Tj
T*(who became HÃ¼rrem Sultan; her intrigues as queen in the court and power over )Tj

T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Suleiman was born in Trabzon along the east coast of the Black Sea, probably )Tj
T*(on 6 November 1494.[7] His mother was Valide Sultan Aishe Hafsa Sultan or Hafsa )Tj

T*(science, history, literature, theology, and military tactics in the schools of )Tj

T*(is a little too long, his face thin, and his nose aquiline. He has a shade of a )Tj
T*(moustache and a small beard; nevertheless he has a pleasant mien, though his )Tj
T*(skin tends to pallor. He is said to be a wise Lord, fond of study, and all men )Tj
T*(hope for good from his rule."[10] Some historians claim that in his youth )Tj
T*(Suleiman had an admiration for Alexander the Great.[11][12] He was influenced )Tj
T*(by Alexander's vision of building a world empire that would encompass the east )Tj
T*(and the west, and this created a drive for his subsequent military campaigns in )Tj
T*(Asia and in Africa, as well as in Europe. )Tj
T*( [edit] Military campaigns )Tj
T*( [edit] Conquests in Europe )Tj
T*( Upon succeeding his father, Suleiman began a series of military conquests, )Tj
T*(eventually suppressing a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor of )Tj
T*(Damascus in 1521. Suleiman soon made preparations for the conquest of Belgrade )Tj
T*(from the Kingdom of Hungaryâ€”something his great-grandfather Mehmed II had )Tj
T*(failed to achieve. Its capture was vital in eliminating the Hungarians who, )Tj
T*(following the defeats of the Serbs, Bulgarians, Byzantines and Albanians, )Tj
T*(remained the only formidable force who could block further Ottoman gains in )Tj
T*(Europe. Suleiman encircled Belgrade and began a series of heavy bombardments )Tj
T*(from an island in the Danube. With a garrison of only 700 men, and receiving no )Tj
T*(aid from Hungary, Belgrade fell in August 1521.[13] )Tj
T*( Christendom's major strongholds spread fear across Europe. As the ambassador )Tj
T*(of the Holy Roman Empire to Constantinople was to note, "The capture of )Tj
T*(Belgrade was at the origin of the dramatic events which engulfed Hungary. It )Tj
T*(led to the death of King Louis, the capture of Buda, the occupation of )Tj
T*(Transylvania, the ruin of a flourishing kingdom and the fear of neighbouring )Tj
T*(nations that they would suffer the same fate..."[14] )Tj
T*( The road to Hungary and Austria lay open, but Suleiman diverted his attention )Tj
T*(to the Eastern Mediterranean island of Rhodes, the home base of the Knights )Tj
T*(Hospitaller. In the summer of 1522, taking advantage of the navy he inherited )Tj
T*(from his father, Suleiman dispatched an armada of some 400 ships while )Tj
T*(personally leading an army of 100,000Â across Asia Minor to a point opposite the )Tj
T*(island.[15] Following a siege of five months with brutal encounters, Rhodes )Tj
T*(capitulated and Suleiman allowed the Knights of Rhodes to depart. They )Tj
T*(eventually formed their new base in Malta. )Tj
T*( As relations between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire deteriorated, Suleiman )Tj
T*(resumed his campaign in Eastern Europe and on 29 August 1526, he defeated Louis )Tj
T*(II of Hungary \(1506â€“26\) at the Battle of MohÃ¡cs. In its wake, Hungarian )Tj
T*(resistance collapsed and the Ottoman Empire became the pre-eminent power in )Tj
T*(Eastern Europe.[16] Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, Suleiman )Tj
T*(is said to have lamented: "I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my )Tj
T*(wish that he should be thus cut off while he scarcely tasted the sweets of life )Tj
T*(and royalty."[17][18] While Suleiman was campaigning in Hungary, Turkmen tribes )Tj
T*(in central Anatolia revolted under the leadership of Kalender Ã‡elebi. )Tj
T*( Under Charles V and his brother Ferdinand, the Habsburgs reoccupied Buda and )Tj
T*(took Hungary. As a result, in 1529, Suleiman once again marched through the )Tj
T*(valley of the Danube and regained control of Buda and in the following autumn )Tj
T*(laid siege to Vienna. It was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious )Tj
T*(expedition and the apogee of its drive towards the West. With a reinforced )Tj
T*(garrison of 16,000Â men,[19] the Austrians inflicted upon Suleiman his first )Tj
T*(defeat, sowing the seeds of a bitter Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry which lasted )Tj
T*(until the 20th century.[20] A second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532, )Tj
T*(with Suleiman retreating before reaching the city. In both cases, the Ottoman )Tj
T*(army was plagued by bad weather \(forcing them to leave behind essential siege )Tj
T*(equipment\) and was hobbled by overstretched supply lines.[21] )Tj
T*( By the 1540s a renewal of the conflict in Hungary presented Suleiman with the )Tj
T*(opportunity to avenge the defeat suffered at Vienna. Some Hungarian nobles )Tj
T*(proposed that Ferdinand, who was ruler of neighbouring Austria and tied to )Tj
T*(Louis II's family by marriage, be King of Hungary, citing previous agreements )Tj
T*(that the Habsburgs would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without )Tj

T*( In 1541 the Habsburgs once again engaged in conflict with the Ottomans, )Tj
T*(attempting to lay siege to Buda. With their efforts repulsed, and more Habsburg )Tj
T*(fortresses captured as a result,[23] Ferdinand and his brother Charles V were )Tj
T*(forced to conclude a humiliating five-year treaty with Suleiman. Ferdinand )Tj
T*(renounced his claim to the Kingdom of Hungary and was forced to pay a fixed )Tj
T*(yearly sum to the Sultan for the Hungarian lands he continued to control. Of )Tj
T*(more symbolic importance, the treaty referred to Charles V not as 'Emperor', )Tj
T*(but in rather plainer terms as the 'King of Spain', leading Suleiman to )Tj
T*(consider himself the true 'Caesar'.[24] )Tj
T*( With his main European rivals subdued, Suleiman had assured the Ottoman Empire )Tj
T*(a powerful role in the political landscape of Europe. )Tj
T*( [edit] Ottomanâ€“Safavid War )Tj
T*( As Suleiman stabilized his European frontiers, he now turned his attention to )Tj
T*(the ever present threat posed by the Shi'a Safavid dynasty of Persia. Two )Tj
T*(events in particular were to precipitate a recurrence of tensions. First, Shah )Tj
T*(Tahmasp had the Baghdad governor loyal to Suleiman killed and replaced with an )Tj
T*(adherent of the Shah, and second, the governor of Bitlis had defected and sworn )Tj
T*(allegiance to the Safavids.[25] As a result, in 1533, Suleiman ordered his )Tj
T*(Grand Vizier PargalÄ± Ibrahim Pasha to lead an army into Asia where he retook )Tj
T*(Bitlis and occupied Tabriz without resistance. Having joined Ibrahim in 1534, )Tj
T*(Suleiman made a push towards Persia, only to find the Shah sacrificing )Tj
T*(territory instead of facing a pitched battle, resorting to harassment of the )Tj
T*(Ottoman army as it proceeded along the harsh interior.[26] When in the )Tj
T*(following year Suleiman and Ibrahim made a grand entrance into Baghdad, its )Tj
T*(commander surrendered the city, thereby confirming Suleiman as the leader of )Tj
T*(the Islamic world and the legitimate successor to the Abbasid Caliphs.[27] )Tj
T*( Attempting to defeat the Shah once and for all, Suleiman embarked upon a )Tj
T*(second campaign in 1548â€“1549. As in the previous attempt, Tahmasp avoided )Tj
T*(confrontation with the Ottoman army and instead chose to retreat, using )Tj
T*(scorched earth tactics in the process and exposing the Ottoman army to the )Tj
T*(harsh winter of the Caucasus.[26] Suleiman abandoned the campaign with )Tj
T*(temporary Ottoman gains in Tabriz and the Urmia region, a lasting presence in )Tj
T*(the province of Van, and some forts in Georgia.[28] In 1553 Suleiman began his )Tj
T*(third and final campaign against the Shah. Having initially lost territories in )Tj
T*(Erzurum to the Shah's son, Suleiman retaliated by recapturing Erzurum, crossing )Tj
T*(the Upper Euphrates and laying waste to parts of Persia. The Shah's army )Tj
T*(continued its strategy of avoiding the Ottomans, leading to a stalemate from )Tj
T*(which neither army made any significant gain. In 1554, a settlement was signed )Tj
T*(which was to conclude Suleiman's Asian campaigns. It included the return of )Tj
T*(Tabriz, but secured Baghdad, lower Mesopotamia, the mouths of the river )Tj
T*(Euphrates and Tigris, as well as part of the Persian Gulf.[29] The Shah also )Tj
T*(promised to cease all raids into Ottoman territory. )Tj
T*( [edit] Campaigns in the Indian Ocean )Tj
T*( Ottoman ships had been sailing in the Indian Ocean, since the year 1518. )Tj
T*(Ottoman Admirals such as: Hadim Suleiman Pasha, Seydi Ali Reis[30] and KurtoÄŸlu )Tj
T*(HÄ±zÄ±r Reis are known to have voyaged to the Mughal imperial ports of Thatta, )Tj
T*(Surat and Janjira. The Mughal Emperor Akbar, himself is known to have exchanged )Tj
T*(six documents with Suleiman the Magnificent.[30][31][32] )Tj
T*( In the Indian Ocean, Suleiman led several naval campaigns against the )Tj
T*(Portuguese in an attempt to remove them and reestablish trade with India. Aden )Tj
T*(in Yemen was captured by the Ottomans in 1538, in order to provide an Ottoman )Tj
T*(base for raids against Portuguese possessions on the western coast of modern )Tj
T*(Pakistan and India.[33] Sailing on to India, the Ottomans failed against the )Tj
T*(Portuguese at the Siege of Diu in September 1538, but then returned to Aden )Tj
T*(where they fortified the city with 100 pieces of artillery.[33][34] From this )Tj
T*(base, Sulayman Pasha managed to take control of the whole country of Yemen, )Tj
T*(also taking Sanaa.[33] Aden rose against the Ottomans however and invited the )Tj

T*( With its strong control of the Red Sea, Suleiman successfully managed to )Tj
T*(dispute control of the Indian trade routes to the Portuguese and maintained a )Tj
T*(significant level of trade with the Mughal Empire of South Asia throughout the )Tj
T*(16th century.[35] His admiral Piri Reis led an Ottoman fleet in the Indian )Tj
T*(Ocean, achieving the Capture of Muscat in 1552. )Tj
T*( In 1564, Suleiman received an embassy from Aceh \(modern Indonesia\), requesting )Tj
T*(Ottoman support against the Portuguese. As a result an Ottoman expedition to )Tj
T*(Aceh was launched, which was able to provide extensive military support to the )Tj
T*(Acehnese.[36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Mediterranean and North Africa )Tj
T*( Having consolidated his conquests on land, Suleiman was greeted with the news )Tj
T*(that the fortress of Koroni in Morea \(the modern Peloponnese\) had been lost to )Tj
T*(Charles V's admiral, Andrea Doria. The presence of the Spanish in the Eastern )Tj
T*(Mediterranean concerned Suleiman, who saw it as an early indication of Charles )Tj
T*(V's intention to rival Ottoman dominance in the region. Recognizing the need to )Tj
T*(reassert the navy's preeminence in the Mediterranean, Suleiman appointed an )Tj
T*(exceptional naval commander in the form of Khair ad Din, known to Europeans as )Tj
T*(Barbarossa. Once appointed admiral-in-chief, Barbarossa was charged with )Tj
T*(rebuilding the Ottoman fleet, to such an extent that the Ottoman navy equalled )Tj
T*(in number those of all other Mediterranean countries put together.[37] In 1535 )Tj
T*(Charles V won an important victory against the Ottomans at Tunis, which )Tj
T*(together with the war against Venice the following year, led Suleiman to accept )Tj
T*(proposals from Francis I of France to form an alliance against Charles.[25] In )Tj
T*(1538, the Spanish fleet was defeated by Barbarossa at the Battle of Preveza, )Tj
T*(securing the eastern Mediterranean for the Turks for 33 years until the defeat )Tj
T*(at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. )Tj
T*( East of Morocco, huge territories in North Africa were annexed. The Barbary )Tj
T*(States of Tripolitania, Tunisia, and Algeria became autonomous provinces of the )Tj
T*(Empire, serving as the leading edge of Suleiman's conflict with Charles V, )Tj
T*(whose attempt to drive out the Turks failed in 1541.[38] The piracy carried on )Tj
T*(thereafter by the Barbary pirates of North Africa can be seen in the context of )Tj
T*(the wars against Spain. For a short period Ottoman expansion secured naval )Tj
T*(dominance in the Mediterranean. Ottoman navies also controlled the Red Sea, and )Tj
T*(held the Persian Gulf until 1554, when their ships were defeated by the navy of )Tj
T*(the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese had taken Ormus \(in the Strait of Hormuz\) )Tj
T*(in 1515 and would continue to vie with Suleiman's forces for control of Aden, )Tj
T*(in present-day Yemen. )Tj
T*( In 1542, facing a common Habsburg enemy, Francis I sought to renew the )Tj
T*(Franco-Ottoman alliance. As a result, Suleiman dispatched 100 galleys[39] under )Tj
T*(Barbarossa to assist the French in the western Mediterranean. Barbarossa )Tj
T*(pillaged the coast of Naples and Sicily before reaching France where Francis )Tj
T*(made Toulon the Ottoman admirals naval headquarters. The same campaign had seen )Tj
T*(Barbarossa attack and capture Nice in 1543. By 1544, a peace between Francis I )Tj
T*(and Charles V had put a temporary end to the alliance between France and the )Tj
T*(Ottoman Empire. )Tj
T*( Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, when the Knights Hospitallers were )Tj
T*(re-established as the Knights of Malta in 1530, their actions against Muslim )Tj
T*(navies quickly drew the ire of the Ottomans who assembled another massive army )Tj
T*(in order to dislodge the Knights from Malta. The Ottomans invaded in 1565, )Tj
T*(undertaking the Great Siege of Malta, which began on May 18 and lasted until )Tj
T*(September 8, and is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of Matteo Perez d'Aleccio )Tj
T*(in the Hall of St. Michael and St. George. At first it seemed that this would )Tj
T*(be a repeat of the battle on Rhodes, with most of Malta's cities destroyed and )Tj
T*(half the Knights killed in battle; but a relief force from Spain entered the )Tj
T*(battle, resulting in the loss of 30,000 Ottoman troops and the victory of the )Tj
T*(local Maltese citizenry.[40] )Tj

T*(man of the sword, as his father and great-grandfather had been before him. He )Tj
T*(differed from them in the extent to which he was also a man of the pen. He was )Tj
T*(a great legislator, standing out in the eyes of his people as a high-minded )Tj
T*(sovereign and a magnanimous exponent of justice".[41] The overriding law of the )Tj
T*(empire was the Shari'ah, or Sacred Law, which as the divine law of Islam was )Tj
T*(outside of the Sultan's powers to change. Yet an area of distinct law known as )Tj
T*(the Kanuns \(canonical legislation\) was dependent on Suleiman's will alone, )Tj
T*(covering areas such as criminal law, land tenure and taxation.[42] He collected )Tj
T*(all the judgments that had been issued by the nine Ottoman Sultans who preceded )Tj
T*(him. After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory )Tj
T*(statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to )Tj
T*(violate the basic laws of Islam.[43] It was within this framework that )Tj
T*(Suleiman, supported by his Grand Mufti Ebussuud, sought to reform the )Tj
T*(legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing empire. When the Kanun laws attained )Tj
T*(their final form, the code of laws became known as the kanunâ€i Osmani, or the )Tj
T*("Ottoman laws". Suleiman's legal code was to last more than three hundred )Tj
T*(years.[44] )Tj
T*( Suleiman gave particular attention to the plight of the rayas, Christian )Tj
T*(subjects who worked the land of the Sipahis. His Kanune Raya, or "Code of the )Tj
T*(Rayas", reformed the law governing levies and taxes to be paid by the rayas, )Tj
T*(raising their status above serfdom to the extent that Christian serfs would )Tj
T*(migrate to Turkish territories to benefit from the reforms.[45] The Sultan also )Tj
T*(played a role in protecting the Jewish subjects of his empire for centuries to )Tj
T*(come. In late 1553 or 1554, on the suggestion of his favorite doctor and )Tj
T*(dentist, the Spanish Jew Moses Hamon, the Sultan issued a firman formally )Tj
T*(denouncing blood libels against the Jews.[46] Furthermore, Suleiman enacted new )Tj
T*(criminal and police legislation, prescribing a set of fines for specific )Tj
T*(offenses, as well as reducing the instances requiring death or mutilation. In )Tj
T*(the area of taxation, taxes were levied on various goods and produce, including )Tj
T*(animals, mines, profits of trade, and import-export duties. In addition to )Tj
T*(taxes, officials who had fallen into disrepute were likely to have their land )Tj
T*(and property confiscated by the Sultan. )Tj
T*( Education was another important area for the Sultan. Schools attached to )Tj
T*(mosques and funded by religious foundations provided a largely free education )Tj
T*(to Muslim boys in advance of the Christian countries of the time.[47] In his )Tj
T*(capital, Suleiman increased the number of mektebs \(primary schools\) to )Tj
T*(fourteen, teaching boys to read and write as well as the principles of Islam. )Tj
T*(Young men wishing further education could proceed to one of eight medreses )Tj
T*(\(colleges\), whose studies included grammar, metaphysics, philosophy, astronomy, )Tj
T*(and astrology.[47] Higher medreses provided education of university status, )Tj
T*(whose graduates became imams or teachers. Educational centers were often one of )Tj
T*(many buildings surrounding the courtyards of mosques, others included )Tj
T*(libraries, refectories, fountains, soup kitchens and hospitals for the benefit )Tj
T*(of the public. )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultural achievements )Tj
T*( Under Suleiman's patronage, the Ottoman empire entered the golden age of its )Tj
T*(cultural development. Hundreds of imperial artistic societies \(called the Ehl-i )Tj
T*(Hiref, "Community of the Talented"\) were administered at the Imperial seat, the )Tj
T*(TopkapÄ± Palace. After an apprenticeship, artists and craftsmen could advance in )Tj
T*(rank within their field and were paid commensurate wages in quarterly annual )Tj
T*(installments. Payroll registers that survive testify to the breadth of )Tj
T*(Suleiman's patronage of the arts, the earliest of documents dating from 1526 )Tj
T*(list 40Â societies with over 600Â members. The Ehl-i Hiref attracted the empire's )Tj
T*(most talented artisans to the Sultan's court, both from the Islamic world and )Tj
T*(recently conquered territories in Europe, resulting in a blend of Islamic, )Tj
T*(Turkish and European cultures.[48] Artisans in service of the court included )Tj
T*(painters, book binders, furriers, jewellers and goldsmiths. Whereas previous )Tj
T*(rulers had been influenced by Persian culture \(Suleiman's father, Selim I, )Tj
T*(wrote poetry in Persian\), Suleiman's patronage of the arts had seen the Ottoman )Tj
T*(Empire assert its own artistic legacy.[49] )Tj

T*( Suleiman himself was an accomplished poet, writing in Persian and Turkish )Tj
T*(under the nom de plume Muhibbi \(Lover\). Some of Suleiman's verses have become )Tj
T*(Turkish proverbs, such as the well-known Everyone aims at the same meaning, but )Tj
T*(many are the versions of the story. When his young son Mehmed died in 1543, he )Tj
T*(composed a moving chronogram to commemorate the year: Peerless among princes, )Tj
T*(my Sultan Mehmed.[50][51] In addition to Suleiman's own work, many great )Tj
T*(talents enlivened the literary world during Suleiman's rule, including Fuzuli )Tj
T*(and Baki. The literary historian E. J. W. Gibb observed that "at no time, even )Tj
T*(in Turkey, was greater encouragement given to poetry than during the reign of )Tj
T*(this Sultan".[50] Suleiman's most famous verse is: )Tj

T*(spell of health is the best state.)Tj
T*(What men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;)Tj
T*(Worship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.[52])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Suleiman also became renowned for sponsoring a series of monumental )Tj
T*(architectural developments within his empire. The Sultan sought to turn )Tj
T*(Constantinople into the center of Islamic civilization by a series of projects, )Tj
T*(including bridges, mosques, palaces and various charitable and social )Tj
T*(establishments. The greatest of these were built by the Sultan's chief )Tj
T*(architect, Mimar Sinan, under whom Ottoman architecture reached its zenith. )Tj
T*(Sinan became responsible for over three hundred monuments throughout the )Tj
T*(empire, including his two masterpieces, the SÃ¼leymaniye and Selimiye )Tj
T*(mosquesâ€”the latter built in Adrianople \(now Edirne\) in the reign of Suleiman's )Tj
T*(son Selim II. Suleiman also restored the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the )Tj
T*(Jerusalem city walls \(which are the current walls of the Old City of )Tj

T*( [edit] PargalÄ± Ibrahim Pasha )Tj
T*( PargalÄ± Ibrahim Pasha was the boyhood friend of Suleiman. Ibrahim was )Tj
T*(originally a Christian Greek from Parga, Epirus,[58][59] and when he was young )Tj
T*(was educated at the Palace School under the devshirme system. Suleiman made him )Tj
T*(the royal falconer, then promoted him to first officer of the Royal )Tj
T*(Bedchamber.[60] Ibrahim Pasha rose to Grand Vizier in 1523 and )Tj
T*(commander-in-chief of all the armies. Suleiman also conferred upon Ibrahim )Tj
T*(Pasha the honor of beylerbey of Rumelia, granting Ibrahim authority over all )Tj
T*(Turkish territories in Europe, as well as command of troops residing within )Tj
T*(them in times of war. According to a 17th century chronicler, Ibrahim had asked )Tj
T*(Suleiman not to promote him to such high positions, fearing for his safety; to )Tj
T*(which Suleiman replied that under his reign no matter what the circumstance, )Tj
T*(Ibrahim would never be put to death.[61] )Tj
T*( Yet Ibrahim eventually fell from grace with the Sultan. During his thirteen )Tj
T*(years as Grand Vizier, his rapid rise to power and vast accumulation of wealth )Tj
T*(had made Ibrahim many enemies among the Sultan's court. Reports had reached the )Tj
T*(Sultan of Ibrahim's impudence during a campaign against the Persian Safavid )Tj
T*(empire: in particular his adoption of the title serasker sultan was seen as a )Tj
T*(grave affront to Suleiman.[62] )Tj
T*( Suleiman's suspicion of Ibrahim was worsened by a quarrel between the latter )Tj
T*(and the Minister of Finance Iskender Chelebi. The dispute ended in the disgrace )Tj
T*(of Chelebi on charges of intrigue, with Ibrahim convincing Suleiman to sentence )Tj
T*(the Minister to death. Before his death however, Chelebi's last words were to )Tj
T*(accuse Ibrahim of conspiracy against the Sultan.[62] These dying words )Tj
T*(convinced Suleiman of Ibrahim's disloyalty,[62] and on 15 March 1536 Ibrahim )Tj
T*(was executed. )Tj
T*( [edit] Succession )Tj
T*( Suleiman's two Haseki Sultans had borne him eight sons, four of whom survived )Tj
T*(past the 1550s. They were Mustafa, Selim, BeyazÄ±t, and Cihangir. Of these, only )Tj

T*(GÃ¼lbahar Sultan's \("Rose of Spring"\), and therefore preceded HÃ¼rrem's children )Tj

T*(her own children would be strangled. Yet Mustafa was recognised as the most )Tj

T*(God never allow a Barbary of such strength to come near us", going on to talk )Tj
T*(of Mustafa's "remarkable natural gifts".[63] HÃ¼rrem is usually held at least )Tj
T*(partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor. Although she )Tj
T*(was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role. This did not, )Tj
T*(however, prevent HÃ¼rrem from wielding powerful political influence. Since the )Tj
T*(Empire lacked, until the reign of Ahmed I, any formal means of nominating a )Tj
T*(successor, successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order )Tj
T*(to avert civil unrest and rebellions. In attempting to avoid the execution of )Tj
T*(her sons, HÃ¼rrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa's )Tj
T*(accession to the throne.[52] )Tj
T*( Thus in power struggles apparently instigated by HÃ¼rrem,[60] Suleiman had )Tj
T*(Ibrahim murdered and replaced with her sympathetic son-in-law, RÃ¼stem Pasha. By )Tj
T*(1552, when the campaign against Persia had begun with RÃ¼stem appointed )Tj
T*(commander-in-chief of the expedition, intrigues against Mustafa began. RÃ¼stem )Tj
T*(sent one of Suleiman's most trusted men to report that since Suleiman was not )Tj
T*(at the head of the army, the soldiers thought the time had come to put a )Tj
T*(younger prince on the throne; at the same time he spread rumors that Mustafa )Tj
T*(had proved receptive to the idea. Angered by what he came to believe were )Tj
T*(Mustafa's plans to claim the throne, the following summer upon return from his )Tj
T*(campaign in Persia, Suleiman summoned him to his tent in the EreÄŸli valley,[64] )Tj
T*(stating he would "be able to clear himself of the crimes he was accused of and )Tj
T*(would have nothing to fear if he came".[65] )Tj
T*( Mustafa was confronted with a choice: either he appeared before his father at )Tj
T*(the risk of being killed; or, if he refused to attend, he would be accused of )Tj
T*(betrayal. In the end, Mustafa chose to enter his father's tent, confident that )Tj
T*(the support of the army would protect him. Busbecq, who claims to have received )Tj
T*(an account from an eyewitness, describes Mustafa's final moments. As Mustafa )Tj
T*(entered his father's tent, Suleiman's Eunuchs attacked Mustafa, with the young )Tj
T*(prince putting up a brave defence. Suleiman, separated from the struggle only )Tj
T*(by the linen hangings of the tent, peered through the chamber of his tent and )Tj
T*("directed fierce and threatening glances upon the mutes, and by menacing )Tj
T*(gestures sternly rebuked their hesitation. Thereupon, the mutes in their alarm, )Tj
T*(redoubling their efforts, hurled Mustafa to the ground and, throwing the )Tj
T*(bowstring round his neck, strangled him."[66] )Tj
T*( Cihangir is said to have died of grief a few months after the news of his )Tj
T*(half-brother's murder.[67] The two surviving brothers, BeyazÄ±t and Selim, were )Tj
T*(given command in different parts of the empire. Within a few years, however, )Tj
T*(civil war broke out between the brothers, each supported by his loyal )Tj
T*(forces.[68] With the aid of his father's army, Selim defeated BeyazÄ±t in Konya )Tj
T*(in 1559, leading the latter to seek refuge with the Safavids along with his )Tj
T*(four sons. Following diplomatic exchanges, the Sultan demanded from the Safavid )Tj
T*(Shah that BeyazÄ±t be either extradited or executed. In return for large amounts )Tj
T*(of gold, the Shah allowed a Turkish executioner to strangle BeyazÄ±t and his )Tj
T*(four sons in 1561,[67] clearing the path for Selim's succession to the throne )Tj
T*(seven years later. On 5 or 6 September 1566,[69] Suleiman, who had set out from )Tj
T*(Constantinople to command an expedition to Hungary, died before an Ottoman )Tj
T*(victory at the Battle of SzigetvÃ¡r in Hungary.[70] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( At the time of Suleiman's death, the Ottoman Empire was one of the world's )Tj
T*(foremost powers.[71] Suleiman's conquests had brought under the control of the )Tj
T*(Empire the major Muslim cities \(Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, Damascus, and )Tj
T*(Baghdad\), many Balkan provinces \(reaching present day Croatia and Austria\), and )Tj
T*(most of North Africa. His expansion into Europe had given the Ottoman Turks a )Tj
T*(powerful presence in the European balance of power. Indeed, such was the )Tj
T*(perceived threat of the Ottoman Empire under the reign of Suleiman that )Tj
T*(Austria's ambassador Busbecq warned of Europe's imminent conquest: "On [the )Tj
T*(Turks'] side are the resources of a mighty empire, strength unimpaired, )Tj
T*(habituation to victory, endurance of toil, unity, discipline, frugality and )Tj

T*( Altrincham \(i/ËˆÉ’ltrÉªÅ‹É™m/ OL-tring-É™m\) is a market town within the Metropolitan )Tj
T*(Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on flat ground )Tj
T*(south of the River Mersey about 8 miles \(13Â km\) southwest of Manchester city )Tj
T*(centre, 3 miles \(5Â km\) south-southwest of Sale and 10 miles \(16Â km\) east of )Tj
T*(Warrington. As of the 2001 UK census, it had a population of about 41,000. )Tj
T*( Historically a part of Cheshire, Altrincham was established as a market town )Tj
T*(in 1290, a time when most communities were based around agriculture rather than )Tj
T*(trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic )Tj
T*(development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in )Tj
T*(1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in )Tj
T*(the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, )Tj
T*(along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of )Tj
T*(Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I listed buildings and )Tj
T*(a deer park. )Tj
T*( Altrincham today is an affluent commuter town, partly because of its transport )Tj
T*(links. The town has a strong middle class presence; there has been a steady )Tj
T*(increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home )Tj
T*(to Altrincham F.C. and two ice hockey clubs, Manchester Phoenix and Trafford )Tj
T*(Metros. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Local evidence of prehistoric human activity exists in the form of two )Tj
T*(Neolithic arrowheads found in Altrincham, and further afield, a concentration )Tj
T*(of artefacts around Dunham.[1] The remains of a Roman road, part of one of the )Tj
T*(major Roman roads in North West England connecting the legionary fortresses of )Tj
T*(Chester \(Deva Victrix\) and York \(Eboracum\), run through the Broadheath area. As )Tj
T*(it shows signs of having been repaired, the road was in use for a considerable )Tj
T*(period of time.[2] The name Altrincham first appears as "Aldringeham", probably )Tj
T*(meaning "homestead of Aldhere's people".[3] As recently as the 19th century it )Tj
T*(was spelt both Altrincham and Altringham.[4] )Tj
T*( Until the Normans invaded England, the manors surrounding Altrincham were )Tj
T*(owned by the Saxon thegn Alweard; after the invasion they became the property )Tj
T*(of Hamon de Massey,[3][5] though Altrincham is not mentioned in the Domesday )Tj
T*(Book. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290,[6] when it )Tj
T*(was granted its charter as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V.[7] The )Tj
T*(charter allowed a weekly market to be held, and it is possible that de Massey )Tj
T*(established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. This )Tj
T*(suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town, unusual during )Tj
T*(the Middle Ages, when most communities were agricultural.[8] Altrincham was )Tj
T*(probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than DunhamÂ â€“ which )Tj
T*(would have been protected by Dunham CastleÂ â€“ because its good access to roads )Tj
T*(was important for trade.[9] )Tj
T*( Altrincham Fair became St James's Fair or Samjam in 1319 and continued until )Tj
T*(1895. Fair days had their own court of Pye Powder \(a corruption of the French )Tj
T*(for "dusty feet"\), presided over by the mayor and held to settle disputes )Tj
T*(arising from the day's dealings.[10] By 1348 the town had 120Â burgage plotsÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(ownership of land used as a measure of status and importance in an areaÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(putting it on a par with the Cheshire town of Macclesfield and above Stockport )Tj
T*(and Knutsford.[11] The earliest known residence in Altrincham was The Knoll, on )Tj
T*(Stamford Street near the centre of the medieval town. An 1983 excavation on the )Tj
T*(demolished building, made by South Trafford Archaeological Group, discovered )Tj
T*(evidence that the house dated from the 13th or 14th century, and that it may )Tj
T*(have contained a drying kiln or malting floor.[12] During the English Civil )Tj
T*(War, men from Altrincham fought for the Parliamentarian Sir George Booth. )Tj
T*(During the war, armies camped on nearby Bowdon Downs on several occasions.[10] )Tj
T*( In 1754, a stretch of road south of Altrincham, along the Manchester to )Tj
T*(Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed passengers )Tj
T*(for the maintenance of the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from )Tj

T*(Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of )Tj
T*(roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike )Tj
T*(trusts had already declined.[13] The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to )Tj
T*(Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many )Tj
T*(years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables.[14] By 1767, warehouses had been )Tj
T*(built alongside the canal at Broadheath, the first step in the development of )Tj
T*(Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's )Tj
T*(industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, )Tj
T*(providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the )Tj
T*(Irish Sea.[15] )Tj
T*( Moves to connect the town to the UK's railway network gained pace in 1845, )Tj
T*(when the Act of Parliament for the construction of the Manchester South )Tj
T*(Junction and Altrincham Railway \(MSJAR\) was passed. The first train left )Tj
T*(Altrincham early on 20Â July 1849, carrying 65Â passengers. The MSJAR had two )Tj
T*(stations in the town: Altrincham, on Stockport Road, and BowdonÂ â€“ though not )Tj
T*(actually in BowdonÂ â€“ on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 )Tj
T*(by Altrincham &amp; Bowdon station on Stamford New Road.[16] The London and )Tj
T*(North Western Railway's station at Broadheath, on the town's northern edge, was )Tj
T*(opened in 1854, while a further connection was created on 12Â May 1862 by the )Tj
T*(Cheshire Midland Railway \(later the Cheshire Lines Committee\), who opened their )Tj
T*(line from Altrincham to Knutsford.[17] )Tj
T*( With its new railway links, Altrincham and the surrounding areas became )Tj
T*(desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live.[16][18] )Tj
T*(Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. )Tj
T*(While some travelled daily by coach, the less wellâ€“toâ€“do commuted by express or )Tj
T*("flyer" barges from Broadheath.[19] Between 1851 and 1881 the population )Tj
T*(increased from 4,488 to 11,250.[20] Broadheath's industrial area, covering )Tj
T*(about 250 acres \(1.0Â km2\), was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of )Tj
T*(Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, )Tj
T*(warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, )Tj
T*(canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, )Tj
T*(cameras and grinding machines. The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand )Tj
T*(Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an )Tj
T*(industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14Â companies operated in )Tj
T*(Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg )Tj
T*(Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172Â workers' homes near its factory, )Tj
T*(helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's )Tj
T*(industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased )Tj
T*(by 35Â per cent, fromÂ 12,440 toÂ 16,831.[21] )Tj
T*( From the turn of the 20th century to the start of the Second World War, there )Tj
T*(were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the )Tj
T*(Luftwaffe's raids on Greater Manchester, it emerged from the war relatively )Tj
T*(unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This )Tj
T*(manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding )Tj
T*(of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined )Tj
T*(by nearly 40Â per cent.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governance )Tj
T*( Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was )Tj
T*(granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de MasseyÂ V. The )Tj
T*(charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's )Tj
T*(burgesses to tax people passing through the borough.[23] Burgesses were free )Tj
T*(men who lived in the town.[24] The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and )Tj
T*(elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were )Tj
T*(keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.[25] )Tj
T*( The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of )Tj
T*(1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the )Tj
T*(Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886.[26] The Public Health Act of 1848 )Tj
T*(led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address )Tj
T*(the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing populationÂ â€“ the first )Tj

T*( Historically, Altrincham was a market town and the two main areas of )Tj
T*(employment were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into )Tj
T*(decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the )Tj
T*(mid-19th century and the market still continues.[51] During the Industrial )Tj
T*(Revolution, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the Broadheath )Tj
T*(area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four )Tj
T*(cotton mills in Altrincham, part of its textile industry, although they had )Tj
T*(closed by the 1851 census. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham )Tj
T*(mirrored the decline of the industry in the Trafford area as a result of a lack )Tj
T*(of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as )Tj
T*(Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham.[14][52] During the late 19th and )Tj
T*(early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local )Tj
T*(employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th )Tj
T*(century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 )Tj
T*(and 1970.[16][22] Despite the presence of retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's )Tj
T*(and Marks &amp; Spencer in the town, and redevelopment schemes costing over )Tj
T*(Â£100Â million,[53][54] Altrincham's 15.5Â per cent level of employment in retail )Tj
T*(is below the national average of 16.9Â per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours )Tj
T*(Bowdon and Hale, is said to constitute a "stockbroker belt", with )Tj

T*( [edit] Landmarks and attractions )Tj
T*( The Old Market Place is thought to stand on the site of the original town )Tj
T*(settlement. Now a registered conservation area it consists of a series of part )Tj
T*(timber-framed buildings echoing the wattle and daub constructions of the )Tj
T*(original houses and burgage plots. The cobblestone paving was replaced in 1896. )Tj
T*(The Buttermarket which stood in the area near the Old Market Place from the )Tj
T*(17th century until the late 19th century was also the site for dispensing early )Tj
T*(local justice. A courtroom, stocks and whipping post saw public floggings take )Tj
T*(place there until the early 19th century. The whipping post and stocks were )Tj
T*(restored as a tourist attraction by local traders in the 1990s. However the )Tj
T*(Buttermarket area was also a site of religious importance, since prospective )Tj
T*(brides and grooms are thought to have declared their intentions here.[61] In )Tj
T*(1814 Thomas de Quincey described the Old Market Place in his Confessions of an )Tj
T*(English Opium Eater while travelling from Manchester to Chester. He noted how )Tj
T*(little the place had changed since his visit 14 years earlier at the age of )Tj
T*(three, and that "fruits, such as can be had in July, and flowers were scattered )Tj
T*(about in profusion: even the stalls of the butchers, from their brilliant )Tj
T*(cleanliness, appeared attractive: and bonny young women of Altrincham were all )Tj
T*(tripping about in caps and aprons coquettishly disposed".[62] Another of )Tj
T*(Altrincham's attractions is the historic market, set up over 700 years ago when )Tj
T*(the town was first established.[63] )Tj
T*( Of the 21 conservation areas in Trafford, ten are in Altrincham: The Downs, )Tj
T*(The Devisdale, Bowdon, Ashley Heath, Goose Green, Old Market Place, Sandiway, )Tj

T*(town's outskirts is the 18th-century Dunham Massey Hall,[65] surrounded by its )Tj
T*(250-acre \(1Â km2\) deer park, both now owned by the National Trust. The hall is )Tj
T*(early Georgian in style, and along with its stables and carriage house, is a )Tj
T*(GradeÂ I listed building.[66] )Tj
T*( Royd House was built between 1914 and 1916, by local architect Edgar Wood, as )Tj
T*(his own residence. It has a flat concrete roof, a concave faÃ§ade, and is faced )Tj
T*(in Portland red stone and Lancashire brick.[67] It is regarded as one of the )Tj
T*(most advanced examples of early 20th-century domestic architecture, and is )Tj
T*(referenced in architectural digests. It has been a GradeÂ I listed building )Tj
T*(since 1975, one of six such buildings in Trafford.[68][69] The Grade II listed )Tj
T*(clock outside the main transport interchange was built in 1880.[70] )Tj
T*( The 16-acre \(65,000Â m2\) Stamford Park was designed by landscape gardener John )Tj
T*(Shaw. It opened to the public in 1880, as a sports park with areas for cricket )Tj

T*( George Fox \(July 1624Â â€“ 13 January 1691\) was an English Dissenter and a )Tj
T*(founder of the Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as the Quakers or )Tj
T*(Friends. )Tj
T*( The son of a Leicestershire weaver, Fox lived in a time of great social )Tj
T*(upheaval and war. He rebelled against the religious and political authorities )Tj
T*(by proposing an unusual and uncompromising approach to the Christian faith. He )Tj
T*(travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, for which he was often )Tj
T*(persecuted by the authorities who disapproved of his beliefs. )Tj
T*( Fox married Margaret Fell, the widow of one of his wealthier supporters; she )Tj
T*(was a leading Friend. His ministry expanded and he undertook tours of North )Tj
T*(America and the Low Countries, between which he was imprisoned for over a year. )Tj
T*(He spent the final decade of his life working in London to organize the )Tj
T*(expanding Quaker movement. )Tj
T*( Though his movement attracted disdain from some, others such as William Penn )Tj
T*(and Oliver Cromwell viewed Fox with respect. His journal, first published after )Tj
T*(his death, is known even among non-Quakers for its vivid account of his )Tj
T*(personal journey. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( George Fox was born in the strongly puritan village of Drayton-in-the-Clay, )Tj
T*(Leicestershire, England \(now known as Fenny Drayton\), 15Â miles \(24Â km\) )Tj
T*(west-south-west of Leicester. He was the eldest of four children of Christopher )Tj
T*(Fox, a successful weaver, called "Righteous Christer"[2] by his neighbours, and )Tj
T*(his wife, Mary nÃ©e Lago. Christopher Fox was a churchwarden and was relatively )Tj
T*(wealthy; when he died in the late 1650s he was able to leave his son a )Tj
T*(substantial legacy.[3] From childhood Fox was of a serious, religious )Tj
T*(disposition. There is no record of any formal schooling but he learned to read )Tj
T*(and write. "When I came to eleven years of age", he said, "I knew pureness and )Tj
T*(righteousness; for, while I was a child, I was taught how to walk to be kept )Tj
T*(pure. The Lord taught me to be faithful, in all things, and to act faithfully )Tj
T*(two ways; viz., inwardly to God, and outwardly to man."[4] )Tj
T*( As he grew up, his relatives "thought to have made me a priest" but he was )Tj
T*(instead apprenticed to a local shoemaker and grazier, George Gee of )Tj
T*(Mancetter.[5] This suited his contemplative temperament and he became well )Tj
T*(known for his diligence among the wool traders who had dealings with his )Tj
T*(master. A constant obsession for Fox was the pursuit of "simplicity" in life, )Tj
T*(meaning humility and the abandonment of luxury, and the short time he spent as )Tj
T*(a shepherd was important to the formation of this view. Toward the end of his )Tj
T*(life he wrote a letter for general circulation pointing out that Abel, Noah, )Tj
T*(Abraham, Jacob, Moses and David were all keepers of sheep or cattle and )Tj
T*(therefore that a learned education should not be seen as a necessary )Tj
T*(qualification for ministry.[6] )Tj
T*( George Fox knew people who were "professors" \(followers of the standard )Tj
T*(religion\), but by the age of nineteen he had begun to look down on their )Tj
T*(behaviour, in particular their drinking of alcohol. He records that, in prayer )Tj
T*(one night after leaving two acquaintances at a drinking session, he heard an )Tj
T*(inner voice saying, "Thou seest how young people go together into vanity, and )Tj
T*(old people into the earth; thou must forsake all, young and old, keep out of )Tj
T*(all, and be as a stranger unto all."[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] First travels )Tj
T*( Driven by his "inner voice", Fox left Drayton-in-the-Clay in September 1643, )Tj
T*(moving toward London in a state of mental torment and confusion. The English )Tj
T*(Civil War had begun and troops were stationed in many towns through which he )Tj

T*(passed.[3] In Barnet, he was torn by depression \(perhaps from the temptations )Tj
T*(of the resort town near London\). He alternately shut himself in his room for )Tj
T*(days at a time or went out alone into the countryside. After almost a year he )Tj
T*(returned to Drayton, where he engaged Nathaniel Stephens, the clergyman of his )Tj
T*(hometown, in long discussions on religious matters.[8] Stephens considered Fox )Tj
T*(a gifted young man but the two disagreed on so many issues that he later called )Tj
T*(Fox mad and spoke against him.[9] )Tj
T*( Over the next few years Fox continued to travel around the country as his )Tj
T*(particular religious beliefs took shape. At times he actively sought the )Tj
T*(company of clergy but found no comfort from them as they seemed unable to help )Tj
T*(with the matters troubling him. One, in Warwickshire, advised him to take )Tj
T*(tobacco \(which Fox disliked\) and sing psalms; another, in Coventry, lost his )Tj
T*(temper when Fox accidentally stood on a flower in his garden; a third suggested )Tj
T*(bloodletting.[10] He became fascinated by the Bible, which he studied )Tj
T*(assiduously.[11] He hoped to find among the "English Dissenters" a spiritual )Tj
T*(understanding absent from the established church but fell out with one group, )Tj
T*(for example, because he maintained that women had souls:[12] )Tj
T*( as I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and )Tj
T*(those esteemed the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them )Tj
T*(all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all )Tj
T*(men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what )Tj
T*(to do, then, oh, then, I heard a voice which said, "There is one, even Christ )Tj
T*(Jesus, that can speak to thy condition"; and when I heard it my heart did leap )Tj
T*(for joy. Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could )Tj
T*(speak to my condition, namely, that I might give Him all the glory; for all are )Tj
T*(concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief as I had been, that Jesus Christ )Tj
T*(might have the pre-eminence who enlightens, and gives grace, and faith, and )Tj
T*(power. Thus when God doth work, who shall let \(i.e. prevent\) it? And this I )Tj
T*(knew experimentally.[13][14])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( He thought intensely about the Temptation of Christ, which he compared to his )Tj
T*(own spiritual condition, but drew strength from his conviction that God would )Tj
T*(support and preserve him.[15] In prayer and meditation he came to a greater )Tj
T*(understanding of the nature of his faith and what it required from him; this )Tj
T*(process he called "opening". He also came to what he deemed a deep inner )Tj
T*(understanding of standard Christian beliefs. Among his ideas were: )Tj
T*( Rituals can be safely ignored, as long as one experiences a true spiritual )Tj
T*(conversion.)Tj
T*(The qualification for ministry is given by the Holy Spirit, not by )Tj
T*(ecclesiastical study. This implies that anyone has the right to minister, )Tj
T*(assuming the Spirit guides them, including women and children.[3])Tj
T*(God "dwelleth in the hearts of his obedient people": religious experience is )Tj
T*(not confined to a church building. Indeed, Fox refused to apply the word )Tj
T*("church" to a building, using instead the name "steeple-house", a usage )Tj
T*(maintained by many Quakers today. Fox would just as soon worship in fields and )Tj
T*(orchards, believing that God's presence could be felt anywhere.[16])Tj
T*(Though Fox used the Bible to support his views, Fox reasoned that, because God )Tj
T*(was within the faithful, believers could follow their own inner guide rather )Tj
T*(than rely on a strict reading of Scripture or the word of clerics.[3][17])Tj
T*(Fox also made no clear distinction between Father, Son and Holy Spirit.[3])Tj
T*( [edit] Religious Society of Friends )Tj
T*( In 1647 Fox began to preach publicly:[18] in market-places, fields, appointed )Tj
T*(meetings of various kinds or even sometimes "steeple-houses" after the service. )Tj
T*(His powerful preaching began to attract a small following. It is not clear at )Tj
T*(what point the Society of Friends was formed but there was certainly a group of )Tj
T*(people who often travelled together. At first, they called themselves "Children )Tj
T*(of the Light" or "Friends of the Truth", and later simply "Friends". Fox seems )Tj
T*(to have had no desire to found a sect but only to proclaim what he saw as the )Tj
T*(pure and genuine principles of Christianity in their original simplicity, )Tj
T*(though he afterward showed great prowess as a religious legislator in the )Tj

T*(organization he gave to the new society. )Tj
T*( There were a great many rival Christian denominations holding very diverse )Tj
T*(opinions; the atmosphere of dispute and confusion gave Fox an opportunity to )Tj
T*(put forward his own beliefs through his personal sermons. Fox's preaching was )Tj
T*(grounded in scripture but was mainly effective because of the intense personal )Tj
T*(experience he was able to project.[3] He was scathing about immorality, deceit )Tj
T*(and the exacting of tithes and urged his listeners to lead lives without )Tj
T*(sin,[19] avoiding the Ranter's antinomian view that a believer becomes )Tj
T*(automatically sinless. By 1651 he had gathered other talented preachers around )Tj
T*(him and continued to roam the country despite a harsh reception from some )Tj
T*(listeners, who would whip and beat them to drive them away.[20] The worship of )Tj
T*(Friends in the form of silent waiting seems to have been well-established by )Tj
T*(this time,[21] though it is not recorded how this came to be. )Tj
T*( [edit] Imprisonment )Tj
T*( Fox complained to judges about decisions he considered morally wrong, as in )Tj
T*(his letter on the case of a woman due to be executed for theft.[22] He )Tj
T*(campaigned against the paying of tithes, which funded the established church )Tj
T*(and often went into the pockets of absentee landlords or religious colleges far )Tj
T*(away from the paying parishioners. In his view, as God was everywhere and )Tj
T*(anyone could preach, the established church was unnecessary and a university )Tj
T*(qualification irrelevant for a preacher.[3] Conflict with civil authority was )Tj
T*(inevitable. Fox was imprisoned several times, the first at Nottingham in )Tj
T*(1649.[23] At Derby in 1650 he was imprisoned for blasphemy; a judge mocked )Tj
T*(Fox's exhortation to "tremble at the word of the Lord", calling him and his )Tj
T*(followers "Quakers".[24] Following his refusal to fight against the return of )Tj
T*(the monarchy \(or to take up arms for any reason\), his sentence was doubled.[25] )Tj
T*(The refusal to swear oaths or take up arms came to be a much more important )Tj
T*(part of his public statements. Refusal to take oaths meant that Quakers could )Tj
T*(be prosecuted under laws compelling subjects to pledge allegiance, as well as )Tj
T*(making testifying in court problematic.[3] In a letter of 1652 \(That which is )Tj
T*(set up by the sword\), he urged Friends not to use "carnal weapons" but )Tj
T*("spiritual weapons", saying "let the waves [the power of nations] break over )Tj
T*(your heads". )Tj
T*( In 1652, Fox preached for several hours under a walnut tree at Balby, where )Tj
T*(his disciple Thomas Aldham was instrumental in setting up the first meeting in )Tj
T*(the Doncaster area.[26] In June that year Fox felt that God led him to ascend )Tj
T*(Pendle Hill where he had a vision of many souls coming to Christ. From there he )Tj
T*(travelled to Sedbergh in Westmorland, where he had heard a group of Seekers )Tj
T*(were meeting, and preached to over a thousand people on Firbank Fell, )Tj
T*(convincing many, including Francis Howgill, to accept that Christ might speak )Tj
T*(to people directly.[27] At the end of the month he stayed at Swarthmoor Hall, )Tj
T*(near Ulverston, the home of Thomas Fell, vice-chancellor of the Duchy of )Tj
T*(Lancaster, and his wife, Margaret. At around this time the ad hoc meetings of )Tj
T*(Friends began to be formalized and a monthly meeting was set up in County )Tj
T*(Durham.[3] Margaret became a Quaker and, although Thomas did not convert, his )Tj
T*(familiarity with the Friends proved influential when Fox was arrested for )Tj
T*(blasphemy in October. Fell was one of three presiding judges, and had the )Tj
T*(charges dismissed on a technicality. )Tj
T*( Fox remained at Swarthmoor until summer 1653 then left for Carlisle where he )Tj
T*(was arrested again for blasphemy.[3] It was even proposed to put him to death )Tj
T*(but Parliament requested his release rather than have "a young manÂ ... die for )Tj
T*(religion".[28] Further imprisonments came at London in 1654, Launceston in )Tj
T*(1656, Lancaster in 1660, Leicester in 1662, Lancaster again and Scarborough in )Tj
T*(1664â€“66 and Worcester in 1673â€“75. Charges usually included causing a )Tj
T*(disturbance and travelling without a pass. Quakers fell foul of irregularly )Tj
T*(enforced laws forbidding unauthorized worship while actions motivated by belief )Tj
T*(in social equalityâ€”refusing to use or acknowledge titles, take hats off in )Tj
T*(court or bow to those who considered themselves socially superiorâ€”were seen as )Tj
T*(disrespectful.[29] While imprisoned at Launceston Fox wrote, "Christ our Lord )Tj
T*(and master saith 'Swear not at all, but let your communications be yea, yea, )Tj

T*(Apostle James saith, 'My brethren, above all things swear not, neither by )Tj
T*(heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath. Lest ye fall into )Tj
T*(condemnation.'"[30] )Tj
T*( In prison George Fox continued writing and preaching, feeling that )Tj
T*(imprisonment brought him into contact with people who needed his helpâ€”the )Tj
T*(jailers as well as his fellow prisoners. He also sought to set an example by )Tj
T*(his actions there, turning the other cheek when being beaten and refusing to )Tj
T*(show his captors any dejected feelings. )Tj
T*( [edit] Encounters with Oliver Cromwell )Tj
T*( Parliamentarians grew suspicious of monarchist plots and fearful that the )Tj
T*(group travelling with Fox aimed to overthrow the government: by this time his )Tj
T*(meetings were regularly attracting crowds of over a thousand. In early 1655 he )Tj
T*(was arrested at Whetstone, Leicestershire and taken to London under armed )Tj
T*(guard. In March[31] he was brought before the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. )Tj
T*(After affirming that he had no intention of taking up arms Fox was able to )Tj
T*(speak with Cromwell for most of the morning about the Friends and advised him )Tj
T*(to listen to God's voice and obey it so that, as Fox left, Cromwell "with tears )Tj
T*(in his eyes said, 'Come again to my house; for if thou and I were but an hour )Tj
T*(of a day together, we should be nearer one to the other'; adding that he wished )Tj
T*([Fox] no more ill than he did to his own soul."[32] )Tj
T*( This episode was later recalled as an example of "speaking truth to power", a )Tj
T*(preaching technique by which subsequent Quakers hoped to influence the )Tj
T*(powerful.[33] Although not used until the 20th century, the phrase is related )Tj
T*(to the ideas of plain speech and simplicity which Fox practiced, but motivated )Tj
T*(by the more worldly goal of eradicating war, injustice and oppression. )Tj
T*( Fox petitioned Cromwell over the course of 1656, asking him to alleviate the )Tj
T*(persecution of Quakers.[34] Later that year, they met for a second time at )Tj
T*(Whitehall. On a personal level, the meeting went well; despite disagreements )Tj
T*(between the two men, they had a certain rapport. Fox felt moved to invite )Tj
T*(Cromwell to "lay down his crown at the feet of Jesus"â€”which, however, Cromwell )Tj
T*(declined to do.[35] Fox met Cromwell again twice in March 1657.[36] Their last )Tj
T*(meeting was in 1658 at Hampton Court, though they could not speak for long or )Tj
T*(meet again because of the Protector's worsening illnessâ€”Fox even wrote that "he )Tj
T*(looked like a dead man".[37] Cromwell died in September of that year. )Tj
T*( [edit] James Nayler )Tj
T*( One early Quaker convert, the Yorkshireman James Nayler, arose as a prominent )Tj
T*(preacher in London around 1655. A breach began to form between Fox's and )Tj
T*(Nayler's followers. As Fox was held prisoner at Launceston, Nayler moved )Tj
T*(south-westwards towards Launceston intending to meet Fox and heal any rift. On )Tj
T*(the way he was arrested himself and held at Exeter. After Fox was released from )Tj
T*(Launceston gaol in 1656, he preached throughout the West Country. Arriving at )Tj
T*(Exeter late in September, Fox was reunited with Nayler. Nayler and his )Tj
T*(followers refused to remove their hats while Fox prayed, which Fox took as both )Tj
T*(a personal slight and a bad example. When Nayler refused to kiss Fox's hand, )Tj
T*(Fox told Nayler to kiss his foot instead. Nayler was offended and the two )Tj
T*(parted acrimoniously. Fox wrote, "there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst )Tj
T*(Friends".[38] )Tj
T*( After Nayler's own release later the same year he rode into Bristol )Tj
T*(triumphantly playing the part of Jesus Christ in a re-enactment of Palm Sunday. )Tj
T*(He was arrested and taken to London, where Parliament defeated a motion to )Tj
T*(execute him by 96â€“82. Instead, they ordered that he be pilloried and whipped )Tj
T*(through both London and Bristol, branded on his forehead with the letter B \(for )Tj
T*(blasphemer\), bored through the tongue with a red-hot iron and imprisoned in )Tj
T*(solitary confinement with hard labour.[39] Nayler was released in 1659, but he )Tj
T*(was a broken man. On meeting Fox in London, he fell to his knees and begged )Tj
T*(Fox's forgiveness. Shortly afterward, Nayler was attacked by thieves while )Tj
T*(travelling home to his family, and died.[3] )Tj

T*(1657â€”hardened George Fox's opinions of traditional religious and social )Tj
T*(practices. In his preaching, he often emphasized the Quaker rejection of )Tj
T*(baptism by water; this was a useful way of highlighting how the focus of )Tj
T*(Friends on inward transformation differed from what he saw as the superstition )Tj
T*(of outward ritual. It was also deliberately provocative to adherents of those )Tj
T*(practices, providing opportunities for Fox to argue with them on matters of )Tj
T*(scripture. This pattern was also found in his court appearances: when a judge )Tj
T*(challenged him to remove his hat, Fox riposted by asking where in the Bible )Tj
T*(such an injunction could be found. )Tj
T*( The Society of Friends became increasingly organized towards the end of the )Tj
T*(decade. Large meetings were held, including a three-day event in Bedfordshire, )Tj
T*(the precursor of the present Britain Yearly Meeting system.[40] Fox )Tj
T*(commissioned two Friends to travel around the country collecting the )Tj
T*(testimonies of imprisoned Quakers, as evidence of their persecution; this led )Tj
T*(to the establishment in 1675 of Meeting for Sufferings, which has continued to )Tj
T*(the present day.[41] )Tj
T*( The 1650s, when the Friends were most confrontational, was one of the most )Tj
T*(creative periods of their history. During the Commonwealth, Fox had hoped that )Tj
T*(the movement would become the major church in England. Disagreements, )Tj
T*(persecution and increasing social turmoil, however, led Fox to suffer from a )Tj
T*(severe depression, which left him deeply troubled at Reading, Berkshire, for )Tj
T*(ten weeks in 1658 or 1659.[42] In 1659, he sent parliament his most politically )Tj
T*(radical pamphlet, Fifty nine Particulars laid down for the Regulating things, )Tj
T*(but the year was so chaotic that it never considered them; the document was not )Tj
T*(reprinted until the 21st century.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Restoration )Tj
T*( With the restoration of the monarchy, Fox's dreams of establishing the Friends )Tj
T*(as the dominant religion seemed at an end. He was again accused of conspiracy, )Tj
T*(this time against Charles II, and fanaticismâ€”a charge he resented. He was )Tj
T*(imprisoned in Lancaster for five months, during which he wrote to the king )Tj
T*(offering advice on governance: Charles should refrain from war and domestic )Tj
T*(religious persecution, and discourage oath-taking, plays, and maypole games. )Tj
T*(These last suggestions reveal Fox's Puritan leanings, which continued to )Tj
T*(influence Quakers for centuries after his death. Once again, Fox was released )Tj
T*(after demonstrating that he had no military ambitions. )Tj
T*( At least on one point, Charles listened to Fox. The seven hundred Quakers who )Tj
T*(had been imprisoned under Richard Cromwell were released, though the government )Tj
T*(remained uncertain about the group's links with other, more violent, movements. )Tj
T*(A revolt by the Fifth Monarchists in January 1661 led to the suppression of )Tj
T*(that sect and the repression of other nonconformists, including Quakers.[43] In )Tj
T*(the aftermath of this attempted coup, Fox and eleven other Quakers issued a )Tj
T*(broadside proclaiming what became known among Friends in the 20th century as )Tj
T*(the "peace testimony": they committed themselves to oppose all outward wars and )Tj
T*(strife as contrary to the will of God. Not all his followers accepted this )Tj
T*(statement; Isaac Penington, for example, dissented for a time arguing that the )Tj
T*(state had a duty to protect the innocent from evil, if necessary by using )Tj
T*(military force. Despite the testimony, persecution against Quakers and other )Tj
T*(dissenters continued.[3] )Tj
T*( Penington and others, such as John Perrot and John Pennyman, were uneasy at )Tj
T*(Fox's increasing power within the movement. Like Nayler before them, they saw )Tj
T*(no reason why men should remove their hats for prayer, arguing that men and )Tj
T*(women should be treated as equals and if, as according to the apostle Paul, )Tj
T*(women should cover their heads, then so could men. Perrot and Penington lost )Tj
T*(the argument. Perrot emigrated to the New World, and Fox retained leadership of )Tj
T*(the movement.[3] )Tj
T*( Parliament enacted laws which forbade non-Anglican religious meetings of more )Tj
T*(than five people, essentially making Quaker meetings illegal. Fox counseled his )Tj
T*(followers to openly violate laws that attempted to suppress the movement, and )Tj
T*(many Friends, including women and children, were jailed over the next two and a )Tj
T*(half decades. Meanwhile, Quakers in New England had been banished \(and some )Tj

T*(executed\), and Charles was advised by his councillors to issue a mandamus )Tj
T*(condemning this practice and allowing them to return.[44] Fox was able to meet )Tj
T*(some of the New England Friends when they came to London, stimulating his )Tj
T*(interest in the colonies. Fox was unable to travel there immediately: he was )Tj
T*(imprisoned again in 1664 for his refusal to swear the oath of allegiance, and )Tj
T*(on his release in 1666 was preoccupied with organizational mattersâ€”he )Tj
T*(normalized the system of monthly and quarterly meetings throughout the country, )Tj
T*(and extended it to Ireland. )Tj
T*( Visiting Ireland also gave him the opportunity to preach against what he saw )Tj
T*(as the excesses of the Roman Catholic Church, in particular the use of ritual. )Tj
T*(More recent Quaker commentators have noted points of contact between the )Tj
T*(denominations: both claim the actual presence of God in their meetings, and )Tj
T*(both allow the collective opinion of the church to augment Biblical teaching. )Tj
T*(Fox, however, did not perceive this, brought up as he was in a wholly )Tj
T*(Protestant environment hostile to "Popery". )Tj
T*( Fox married Margaret Fell of Swarthmoor Hall, a lady of high social position )Tj
T*(and one of his early converts, on 27 October 1669 at a meeting in Bristol. She )Tj
T*(was ten years his senior and had eight children \(all but one of them Quakers\) )Tj
T*(by her first husband, Thomas Fell, who had died in 1658. She was herself very )Tj
T*(active in the movement, and had campaigned for equality and the acceptance of )Tj
T*(women as preachers. As there were no priests at Quaker weddings to perform the )Tj
T*(ceremony, the union took the form of a civil marriage approved by the )Tj
T*(principals and the witnesses at a meeting. Ten days after the marriage, )Tj
T*(Margaret returned to Swarthmoor to continue her work there while George went )Tj
T*(back to London.[45] Their shared religious work was at the heart of their life )Tj
T*(together, and they later collaborated on a great deal of the administration the )Tj
T*(Society required. Shortly after the marriage, Margaret was imprisoned at )Tj
T*(Lancaster;[46] George remained in the south-east of England, becoming so ill )Tj
T*(and depressed that for a time he lost his sight.[47] )Tj
T*( [edit] Travels in America and Europe )Tj
T*( By 1671 Fox had recovered and Margaret had been released by order of the King. )Tj
T*(Fox resolved to visit the English settlements in America and the West Indies, )Tj
T*(remaining there for two years, possibly to counter any remnants of Perrot's )Tj
T*(teaching there.[3] After a voyage of seven weeks, during which dolphins were )Tj
T*(caught and eaten, the party arrived in Barbados on 3 October 1671.[48] From )Tj
T*(there, Fox sent an epistle to Friends spelling out the role of women's meetings )Tj
T*(in the Quaker marriage ceremony, a point of controversy when he returned home. )Tj
T*(One of his proposals suggested that the prospective couple should be )Tj
T*(interviewed by an all-female meeting prior to the marriage to determine whether )Tj
T*(there were any financial or other impediments. Though women's meetings had been )Tj
T*(held in London for the last ten years, this was an innovation in Bristol and )Tj
T*(the north-west of England, which many there felt went too far.[3] )Tj
T*( Fox wrote a letter to the governor and assembly of the island in which he )Tj
T*(refuted charges that Quakers were stirring up the slaves to revolt and tried to )Tj
T*(affirm the orthodoxy of Quaker beliefs. After a stay in Jamaica, Fox's first )Tj
T*(landfall on the North American continent was at Maryland, where he participated )Tj
T*(in a four-day meeting of local Quakers. He remained there while various of his )Tj
T*(English companions travelled to the other colonies, because he wished to meet )Tj
T*(some Native Americans who were interested in Quaker waysâ€”though he relates that )Tj
T*(they had "a great dispute" among themselves about whether to participate in the )Tj
T*(meeting. Fox was impressed by their general demeanour, which he said was )Tj
T*("courteous and loving".[49] He resented the suggestion \(from a man in North )Tj
T*(Carolina\) that "the Light and Spirit of GodÂ ... was not in the Indians", a )Tj
T*(proposition which Fox refuted.[50] Fox left no record of encountering slaves on )Tj
T*(the mainland. )Tj
T*( Elsewhere in the colonies, Fox helped to establish organizational systems for )Tj
T*(the Friends, along the same lines as he had done in Britain.[51] He also )Tj
T*(preached to many non-Quakers, some but not all of whom were converted. )Tj
T*( Following extensive travels around the various American colonies, George Fox )Tj
T*(returned to England in June 1673 confident that his movement was firmly )Tj

T*(established there. Back in England, however, he found his movement sharply )Tj
T*(divided among provincial Friends \(such as William Rogers, John Wilkinson and )Tj
T*(John Story\) who resisted establishment of women's meetings and the power of )Tj
T*(those who resided in or near London. With William Penn and Robert Barclay as )Tj
T*(allies of Fox, the challenge to Fox's leadership was eventually put down.[3] )Tj
T*(But in the midst of the dispute, Fox was imprisoned again for refusing to swear )Tj
T*(oaths after being captured at Armscote, Worcestershire.[52] His mother died )Tj
T*(shortly after hearing of his arrest and Fox's health began to suffer.[53] )Tj
T*(Margaret Fell petitioned the king for his release,[54] which was granted,[55] )Tj
T*(but Fox felt too weak to take up his travels immediately. Recuperating at )Tj
T*(Swarthmoor, he began dictating what would be published after his death as his )Tj
T*(journal and devoted his time to his written output: letters, both public and )Tj
T*(private, as well as books and essays.[56] Much of his energy was devoted to the )Tj
T*(topic of oaths, having become convinced of its importance to Quaker ideas. By )Tj
T*(refusing to swear, he felt that he could bear witness to the value of truth in )Tj
T*(everyday life, as well as to God, who he associated with truth and the inner )Tj
T*(light. )Tj
T*( For three months in 1677 and a month in 1684, Fox visited the Friends in the )Tj
T*(Netherlands, and organized their meetings for discipline. The first trip was )Tj
T*(the more extensive, taking him into what is now Germany, proceeding along the )Tj
T*(coast to Friedrichstadt and back again over several days. Meanwhile, Fox was )Tj
T*(participating in a dispute among Friends in Britain over the role of women in )Tj
T*(meetings, a struggle which took much of his energy and left him exhausted. )Tj
T*(Returning to England, he stayed in the south in order to try to end the )Tj
T*(dispute. He followed the foundation of the colony of Pennsylvania, where Penn )Tj
T*(had given him over 1,000 acres \(4.0Â km2\) of land, with interest.[3] Persecution )Tj
T*(continued, with Fox arrested briefly in October 1683. Fox's health was becoming )Tj
T*(worse, but he continued his activitiesâ€”writing to leaders in Poland, Denmark, )Tj
T*(Germany, and elsewhere about his beliefs, and their treatment of Quakers. )Tj
T*( [edit] Last years )Tj
T*( In the last years of his life, Fox continued to participate in the London )Tj
T*(Meetings, and still made representations to Parliament about the sufferings of )Tj
T*(Friends. The new King, James II, pardoned religious dissenters jailed for )Tj
T*(failure to attend the established church, leading to the release of about 1500 )Tj
T*(Friends. Though the Quakers lost influence after the Glorious Revolution, which )Tj
T*(deposed James II, the Act of Toleration 1689 put an end to the uniformity laws )Tj
T*(under which Quakers had been persecuted, permitting them to assemble freely. )Tj
T*( Two days after preaching, as usual, at the Gracechurch Street Meeting House in )Tj
T*(London, George Fox died between 9 and 10 p.m. on 13 January 1691. He was )Tj
T*(interred in the Nonconformists' burying ground at Bunhill Fields in London )Tj
T*(three days later in the presence of thousands of mourners.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Journal and letters )Tj
T*( His journal was first published in 1694, after editing by Thomas Ellwoodâ€”a )Tj
T*(friend and associate of John Miltonâ€”with a preface by William Penn. Like most )Tj
T*(similar works of its time the journal was not written contemporaneously to the )Tj
T*(events it describes, but rather compiled many years later, much of it dictated. )Tj
T*(Parts of the journal were not in fact by Fox at all but are constructed by its )Tj
T*(editors from diverse sources and written as if by him.[59] The dissent within )Tj
T*(the movement and the contributions of others to the development of Quakerism )Tj
T*(are largely excluded from the narrative. Fox portrays himself as always in the )Tj
T*(right and always vindicated by God's interventions on his behalf.[3] As a )Tj
T*(religious autobiography, Rufus Jones compared it to such works as Augustine's )Tj
T*(Confessions and John Bunyan's Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners. It is, )Tj
T*(though, an intensely personal work with little dramatic power that only )Tj
T*(succeeds in appealing to readers after substantial editing. Historians have )Tj
T*(used it as a primary source because of its wealth of detail on ordinary life in )Tj
T*(the 17th century, and the many towns and villages which Fox visited.[60] )Tj
T*( Hundreds of Fox's lettersâ€”mostly intended for wide circulation, along with a )Tj
T*(few private communicationsâ€”were also published. Written from the 1650s onwards, )Tj
T*(with such titles as Friends, seek the peace of all men or To Friends, to know )Tj

T*(one another in the light, they give enormous insight into the detail of Fox's )Tj
T*(beliefs, and show his determination to spread them. These writings, in the )Tj
T*(words of Henry Cadbury, Professor of Divinity at Harvard University and a )Tj
T*(leading Quaker, "contain a few fresh phrases of his own, [but] are generally )Tj
T*(characterized by an excess of scriptural language and today they seem dull and )Tj
T*(repetitious".[61] Others point out that "Fox's sermons, rich in biblical )Tj
T*(metaphor and common speech, brought hope in a dark time."[62] Fox's aphorisms )Tj
T*(have found an audience beyond Quakers, with many other church groups using them )Tj
T*(to illustrate principles of Christianity. )Tj
T*( Fox is described by Ellwood as "graceful in countenance, manly in personage, )Tj
T*(grave in gesture, courteous in conversation". Penn says he was "civil beyond )Tj
T*(all forms of breeding". We are told that he was "plain and powerful in )Tj
T*(preaching, fervent in prayer", "a discerner of other men's spirits, and very )Tj
T*(much master of his own", skilful to "speak a word in due season to the )Tj
T*(conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary, and )Tj
T*(wanted soul's rest"; "valiant in asserting the truth, bold in defending it, )Tj
T*(patient in suffering for it, immovable as a rock".[63] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Fox's influence on the Society of Friends was of course tremendous, and his )Tj
T*(beliefs have largely been carried forward by that group. Perhaps his most )Tj
T*(significant achievement, other than his predominant influence in the early )Tj
T*(movement, was his leadership in overcoming the twin challenges of government )Tj
T*(prosecution after the Restoration and internal disputes that threatened its )Tj
T*(stability during the same period. Not all of his beliefs were welcome to all )Tj
T*(Quakers: his Puritan-like opposition to the arts[64] and rejection of )Tj
T*(theological study, forestalled development of these practices among Quakers for )Tj
T*(some time. )Tj
T*( The name of George Fox is often invoked by traditionalist Friends who dislike )Tj
T*(modern liberal attitudes to the Society's Christian origins. At the same time, )Tj
T*(Quakers and others can relate to Fox's religious experience, and even those who )Tj
T*(disagree with him regard him as a pioneer. )Tj
T*( Walt Whitman, who was raised by parents inspired by Quaker thought, later )Tj
T*(wrote: "George Fox stands for something tooâ€”a thoughtâ€”the thought that wakes in )Tj
T*(silent hoursâ€”perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought latent in the human )Tj
T*(soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the )Tj
T*(immortality of identity. Great, great is this thoughtâ€”aye, greater than all )Tj
T*(else."[65] )Tj
T*( George Fox University in Oregon, founded as Pacific College in 1891, was )Tj
T*(renamed for him in 1949. He also has a building named after him at Lancaster )Tj
T*(University. James Harcourt played Fox in the 1941 film Penn of Pennsylvania. )Tj

T*(London and studied at length, where under intense scrutiny and producing no )Tj
T*(more rabbits she confessed to the hoax, and was subsequently imprisoned as a )Tj

T*( The resultant public mockery created panic within the medical profession and )Tj
T*(ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on )Tj

T*( The 'poor Woman', Mary Toft, was twenty-four or twenty-five years old. She was )Tj
T*(baptised Mary Denyer on 21Â February 1703, the daughter of John and Jane Denyer. )Tj
T*(In 1720 she married Joshua Toft, a journeyman clothier and together the couple )Tj
T*(had three children, Mary, Anne and James.[3][4] As an 18th-century English )Tj
T*(peasant, circumstances dictated that when in 1726 Toft again became pregnant, )Tj
T*(she continue working in the fields.[5] She complained of painful complications )Tj
T*(early in the pregnancy and in early August egested several pieces of flesh, one )Tj
T*("as big as my arm". This may have been the result of an abnormality of the )Tj
T*(developing placenta, which would have caused the embryo to stop developing and )Tj
T*(blood clots and flesh to be ejected.[6][7][8] Toft went into labour on 27Â )Tj
T*(September. Her neighbour was called and watched as she produced several animal )Tj
T*(parts. This neighbour then showed the pieces to her mother and to her )Tj
T*(mother-in-law, Ann Toft, who by chance was a midwife. Ann Toft sent the flesh )Tj
T*(to John Howard, a Guildford-based man-midwife of thirty years experience.[6][9] )Tj
T*( Initially, Howard dismissed the notion that Toft had given birth to animal )Tj
T*(parts, but the next day, despite his reservations, he went to see her. Ann Toft )Tj
T*(showed him more pieces of the previous night's exertions, but on examining )Tj

T*(the attention of Nathaniel St.Â AndrÃ©, since 1723 a Swiss surgeon to the Royal )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Investigation )Tj
T*( By the middle of November the British Royal Family were so interested in the )Tj
T*(story that they sent St.Â AndrÃ© and Samuel Molyneux, secretary to the Prince of )Tj
T*(Wales, to investigate. Apparently, they were not disappointed; arriving on 15Â )Tj
T*(November they were taken by Howard to see Toft, who within hours delivered a )Tj
T*(rabbit's torso.[1] St.Â AndrÃ©'s account details his examination of the rabbit. )Tj
T*(To check if it had breathed air, he placed a piece of its lung in water to see )Tj
T*(if it would floatâ€”which it did. St.Â AndrÃ© then performed a medical examination )Tj
T*(on Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her Fallopian tubes. In )Tj
T*(the doctors' absence, Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of )Tj
T*(another rabbit, which the two also examined.[11][14] They again returned that )Tj
T*(evening to find Toft again displaying violent contractions. A further medical )Tj
T*(examination followed, and St.Â AndrÃ© delivered some rabbit skin, followed a few )Tj
T*(minutes later by a rabbit's head. Both men inspected the egested pieces of )Tj
T*(flesh, noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat.[15] )Tj
T*( Fascinated, the king then sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to Guildford. Ahlers )Tj
T*(arrived on 20Â November and found Toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy. He may )Tj
T*(have already suspected the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to )Tj
T*(press her knees and thighs together, as if to prevent something from "dropping )Tj
T*(down". He thought Howard's behaviour just as suspicious, as the man-midwife )Tj
T*(would not let him help deliver the rabbitsâ€”although Ahlers was not a )Tj
T*(man-midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through )Tj
T*(considerable pain.[16] Convinced the affair was a hoax, he lied, telling those )Tj
T*(involved that he believed Toft's story, before making his excuses and returning )Tj
T*(to London, taking specimens of the rabbits with him. Upon closer study, he )Tj
T*(reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, )Tj
T*(and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings.[1][17] )Tj
T*( On 21Â November Ahlers reported his findings to the king and later to "several )Tj
T*(Persons of Note and Distinction".[18] Howard wrote to Ahlers the next day, )Tj
T*(asking for the return of his specimens.[17] Ahlers' suspicions began to worry )Tj
T*(both Howard and St.Â AndrÃ©, and apparently the king, as two days later St.Â AndrÃ© )Tj
T*(and a colleague were ordered back to Guildford.[16][19] Upon their arrival they )Tj
T*(met Howard, who told St.Â AndrÃ© that Toft had given birth to two more rabbits. )Tj
T*(She delivered several portions of what was presumed to be a placenta but she )Tj
T*(was by then quite ill, and suffering from a constant pain in the right side of )Tj
T*(her abdomen.[16][20] In a pre-emptive move against Ahlers, St.Â AndrÃ© collected )Tj
T*(affidavits from several witnesses, which in effect cast doubt on Ahlers' )Tj
T*(honesty, and on 26Â November gave an anatomical demonstration before the king to )Tj

T*(support Toft's story.[19][21] According to his pamphlet, neither St.Â AndrÃ© nor )Tj
T*(Molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity.[22] )Tj
T*( St.Â AndrÃ© was ordered by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring )Tj
T*(Toft to London, so that further investigations could be carried out. He was )Tj
T*(accompanied by Richard Manningham, a well-known obstetrician who was knighted )Tj
T*(in 1721, and the second son of Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester.[16] He )Tj
T*(examined Toft and found the right side of her abdomen slightly enlarged. )Tj
T*(Manningham also delivered what he thought was a hog's bladderâ€”although St.Â )Tj
T*(AndrÃ© and Howard disagreed with his identificationâ€”but became suspicious as it )Tj
T*(smelled of urine. Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public )Tj
T*(and on their return to London on 29Â November lodged Toft in Lacey's Bagnio, in )Tj
T*(Leicester Fields.[19][23][24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Examination )Tj
T*( Printed in the early days of newspapers, the story became a national )Tj
T*(sensation, although some publications were sceptical, the Norwich Gazette )Tj
T*(viewing the affair simply as female gossip.[27] Rabbit stew and jugged hare )Tj
T*(disappeared from the dinner table, while as unlikely as the story sounded, many )Tj
T*(physicians felt compelled to see Toft for themselves. The political writer John )Tj
T*(Hervey later told his friend Henry Fox that: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Every creature in town, both men and women, have been to see and feel her: the )Tj
T*(perpetual emotions, noises and rumblings in her Belly are something prodigious; )Tj
T*(all the eminent physicians, surgeons and man-midwives in London are there Day )Tj
T*(and Night to watch her next production.)Tj
T*(â€”John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey,Â [3][28])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Under St.Â AndrÃ©'s strict control Toft was studied by a number of eminent )Tj
T*(physicians and surgeons, including John Maubray. In The Female Physician )Tj
T*(Maubray had proposed women could give birth to a creature he named a Sooterkin. )Tj
T*(He was a proponent of maternal impression, a widely held belief that conception )Tj
T*(and pregnancy could be influenced by what the mother dreamt, or saw,[29] and )Tj
T*(warned pregnant women that over-familiarity with household pets could cause )Tj
T*(their children to resemble those pets. He was reportedly happy to attend Toft, )Tj
T*(pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories,[30] but man-midwife )Tj
T*(James Douglas, like Manningham, presumed that the affair was a hoax and despite )Tj
T*(St.Â AndrÃ©'s repeated invitations, kept his distance. Douglas was one of the )Tj
T*(country's most respected anatomists and a well-known man-midwife, whereas St.Â )Tj
T*(AndrÃ© was often considered to be a member of the court only because of his )Tj
T*(ability to speak the king's native German.[31] St.Â AndrÃ© therefore desperately )Tj
T*(wanted the two to attend Toft; after George I's accession to the throne the )Tj
T*(Whigs had become the dominant political faction, and Manningham and Douglas' )Tj
T*(Whig affiliations and medical knowledge might have elevated his status as both )Tj
T*(doctor and philosopher.[24] Douglas thought that a woman giving birth to )Tj
T*(rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child, but despite )Tj
T*(his scepticism he went to see her. When Manningham informed him of the )Tj
T*(suspected hog's bladder, and after he examined Toft, he refused to engage St.Â )Tj
T*(AndrÃ© on the matter:[32] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(To be able to determine, to the Satisfaction and Conviction of all sorts of )Tj
T*(Persons, other Arguments were necessary, than Anatomy, or any other Branch of )Tj
T*(Physick [sic], could furnish. Of these the greatest Number are not Judges. It )Tj
T*(was therefore undoubtedly very natural for me to desire that People would )Tj
T*(suspend any farther Judgement for a little Time, till such Proofs could be )Tj
T*(brought of the Imposture as they requir'd.)Tj

T*( Under constant supervision, Toft went into labour several times, to no )Tj

T*(husband, Joshua, had been buying young rabbits. Convinced he had enough )Tj
T*(evidence to proceed, in a letter to physician Hans Sloane he wrote that the )Tj
T*(affair had "almost alarmed England" and that he would soon publish his )Tj
T*(findings.[3][35] The same day, Thomas Howard, a porter at the bagnio, confessed )Tj
T*(to Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Clarges that he had been bribed by Toft's )Tj
T*(sister-in-law, Margaret, to sneak a rabbit into Toft's chamber. When arrested )Tj
T*(and questioned Mary denied the accusation, while Margaret, under Douglas's )Tj
T*(interrogation, claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.[36] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I told my sister of my having sent for a rabbit and I desire[d] her to give it )Tj
T*(to the porter to be carryed [sic] away which my sister did saying she would not )Tj
T*(have it known for 1000 p[oun]d[s].)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Manningham examined Toft and thought something remained in the cavity of her )Tj
T*(uterus, and so he successfully persuaded Clarges to allow her to remain at the )Tj
T*(bagnio.[36] Douglas, who had by then visited Toft, questioned her on three or )Tj
T*(four occasions, each time for several hours. After several days of this )Tj
T*(Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her, and on 7Â December, )Tj
T*(in the presence of Manningham, Douglas, John Montagu and Frederick Calvert, )Tj
T*(Toft finally confessed.[3][37] Following her miscarriage and while her cervix )Tj
T*(permitted access, an accomplice had inserted into her womb the claws and body )Tj
T*(of a cat, and the head of a rabbit. They had also invented a story in which )Tj
T*(Toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field, she had )Tj
T*(been startled by a rabbit, and had since become obsessed with rabbits. For )Tj
T*(later parturitions, animal parts had been inserted into her vagina.[38][39] )Tj
T*( Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas \(it was the latter who took her )Tj
T*(confession\), she made a further admission on 8Â December and another on 9Â )Tj
T*(December, before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell, charged on a statute )Tj
T*(of Edward III as a "vile cheat and imposter".[34][37][40] In her earlier, )Tj
T*(unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair on a range of other )Tj
T*(participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. She also claimed that a )Tj
T*(travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such )Tj
T*(a scheme would ensure that she would "never want as long as I liv'd".[7] The )Tj
T*(British Journal reported that on 7Â January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of )Tj
T*(Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged "for being an abominable cheat and )Tj
T*(imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births".[41] )Tj
T*(Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. Mist's )Tj
T*(Weekly Journal of 24Â December 1726 reported that "the nurse has been examined )Tj
T*(as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to )Tj
T*(the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can )Tj
T*(be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others."[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Following the hoax the medical profession's gullibility became the target of a )Tj
T*(great deal of public mockery. William Hogarth published Cunicularii, or The )Tj
T*(Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation \(1726\), which portrays Toft in the throes )Tj
T*(of labour, surrounded by the tale's chief participants. Figure "F" is Toft, "E" )Tj
T*(is her husband. "A" is St.Â AndrÃ©, and "D" is Howard.[25][45][46] In Dennis )Tj
T*(Todd's Three Characters in Hogarth's Cunicularii and Some Implications the )Tj
T*(author concludes that figure "G" is Mary Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret Toft. )Tj
T*(Toft's confession of 7Â December demonstrates her insistence that her )Tj
T*(sister-in-law played no part in the hoax, but Manningham's 1726 An Exact Diary )Tj
T*(of what was observ'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended )Tj
T*(Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey offers eyewitness testimony of her )Tj
T*(complicity.[47] Hogarth's print was not the only image that ridiculed the )Tj
T*(affairâ€”George Vertue published The Surrey-Wonder, and The Doctors in Labour, or )Tj
T*(a New Wim-Wam in Guildford \(12 plates\), a broadsheet published in 1727 which )Tj
T*(satirises St.Â AndrÃ©, was also popular at the time.[48] )Tj
T*( The timing of Toft's confession proved awkward for St.Â AndrÃ©, who on 3Â )Tj
T*(December had published his forty-page pamphlet A Short Narrative of an )Tj
T*(Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets.[46] On this document the surgeon had staked )Tj

T*(his reputation, and although it offers a more empirical account of the Toft )Tj
T*(case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general, )Tj
T*(ultimately it was derided.[49] Ahlers, his scepticism justified, published Some )Tj
T*(observations concerning the woman of Godlyman in Surrey, which details his )Tj
T*(account of events and his suspicion of the complicity of both St.Â AndrÃ© and )Tj
T*(Howard.[50] )Tj
T*( St.Â AndrÃ© recanted his views on 9Â December 1726. In 1729, following the death )Tj
T*(of Samuel Molyneux from poisoning, he married Molyneux's widow, Elizabeth. This )Tj
T*(did little to impress his peers.[51][52] Molyneux's cousin accused him of the )Tj
T*(poisoning, a charge that St.Â AndrÃ© defended by suing for defamation, but the )Tj
T*(careers of St.Â AndrÃ© and his wife were permanently damaged. Elizabeth lost her )Tj
T*(attendance on Queen Caroline, and St.Â AndrÃ© was publicly humiliated at court. )Tj
T*(Living on Elizabeth's considerable wealth, they retired to the country, where )Tj
T*(St.Â AndrÃ© died in 1776, agedÂ 96.[53][54] Manningham, desperate to exculpate )Tj
T*(himself, published a diary of his observations of Mary Toft, together with an )Tj
T*(account of her confession of the fraud, on 12Â December. In it he suggested that )Tj
T*(Douglas had been fooled by Toft, and concerned with his image Douglas replied )Tj
T*(by publishing his own account.[40][55] Using the pseudonym 'Lover of Truth and )Tj
T*(Learning', in 1727 Douglas also published The Sooterkin Dissected. A letter to )Tj
T*(Maubray, Douglas was scathingly critical of his Sooterkin theory, calling it "a )Tj
T*(mere fiction of your [Maubray's] brain".[56] The damage done to the medical )Tj
T*(profession was such that several doctors not connected with the tale felt )Tj
T*(compelled to print statements that they had not believed Toft's story.[46] On 7Â )Tj
T*(January 1727 John Howard and Toft appeared before the bench, where Howard was )Tj
T*(fined Â£800 \(Â£94.8Â thousand today\).[57] He returned to Surrey and continued his )Tj
T*(practice, and died in 1755.[41][44][52] )Tj
T*( Crowds reportedly mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months, hoping to catch )Tj
T*(a glimpse of the now infamous Toft. By this time she had become quite ill, and )Tj
T*(while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by John Laguerre. She was ultimately )Tj
T*(discharged on 8Â April 1727, as it was unclear as to what charge should have )Tj
T*(been made against her.[58] The Toft family made no profit from the affair, and )Tj
T*(Mary Toft returned to Surrey. She had a daughter in February 1727, and )Tj
T*(reappeared briefly in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods, )Tj
T*(but her death was reported in 1763.[44][59][60] )Tj
T*( The case was cited by Robert Walpole's opponents as symbolising the age, which )Tj
T*(they perceived as greedy, corrupt and deceitful. One author, writing to the )Tj
T*(Prince of Wales's mistress, suggested the story was a political portent of the )Tj
T*(approaching death of the prince's father. On 7Â January 1727 Mist's Weekly )Tj
T*(Journal satirised the matter, making several allusions to political change, and )Tj
T*(comparing the affair to the events of 1641 when Parliament began its revolution )Tj
T*(against King Charles I of England.[61] The scandal provided the writers of Grub )Tj
T*(Street with enough material to produce pamphlets, squibs, broadsides and )Tj
T*(ballads for several months.[62] With publications such as St.Â AndrÃ©'s )Tj
T*(Miscarriage \(1727\) and The anatomist dissected: or the man-midwife finely )Tj
T*(brought to bed \(1727\) satirists scorned the objectivity of men-midwives, and )Tj
T*(critics of Toft's attendants questioned their integrity, undermining their )Tj
T*(profession with sexual puns and allusions.[63] The case raised questions about )Tj
T*(England's status as an "enlightened" nationâ€”Voltaire used the case in his brief )Tj
T*(essay SingularitÃ©s de la nature to describe how the Protestant English were )Tj
T*(still influenced by an ignorant Church.[64] )Tj
T*( Toft did not escape the ire of the satirists, who concentrated mainly on )Tj
T*(sexual innuendo. Some took advantage of a common 18th-century word for a rabbit )Tj
T*(trackâ€”prickâ€”and others were scatological in nature. However, Much Ado about )Tj
T*(Nothing; or, A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written or Said Concerning )Tj
T*(the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming \(1727\) is one of the more cutting satires on )Tj
T*(Toft. The document supposes to be the confession of 'Merry Tuft', "... in her )Tj
T*(own Stile and Spelling". Poking fun at her illiteracy, it makes a number of )Tj
T*(obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuityâ€”"I wos a Wuman as had grate )Tj
T*(nattural parts, and a large Capassiti, and kapible of being kunserned in depe )Tj
T*(Kuntrivansis."[66][67] The document also ridicules several of the physicians )Tj

T*( Characteristics )Tj
T*( When refined, uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive metal, which is )Tj
T*(harder than most elements. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, )Tj
T*(strongly electropositive and is a poor electrical conductor.[8][9] Uranium )Tj
T*(metal has very high density, being approximately 70% denser than lead, but )Tj
T*(slightly less dense than gold. )Tj
T*( Uranium metal reacts with almost all nonmetallic elements and their compounds, )Tj
T*(with reactivity increasing with temperature.[10]Hydrochloric and nitric acids )Tj
T*(dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack )Tj
T*(the element very slowly.[8] When finely divided, it can react with cold water; )Tj
T*(in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide.[9] )Tj
T*(Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or )Tj
T*(other chemical forms usable in industry. )Tj
T*( Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile. Other )Tj
T*(naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. Upon bombardment )Tj
T*(with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into )Tj
T*(two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too )Tj
T*(many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear )Tj
T*(chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or \(in special )Tj

T*(slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. )Tj
T*(Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods \(see )Tj

T*( Applications )Tj
T*( Military )Tj
T*( The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density )Tj
T*(penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium \(DU\) alloyed with )Tj
T*(1â€“2% other elements. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and )Tj
T*(pyrophoricity of the projectile enable destruction of heavily armored targets. )Tj
T*(Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor are also hardened with depleted )Tj
T*(uranium plates. The use of DU became politically and environmentally )Tj
T*(contentious after the use of DU munitions by the US, UK and other countries )Tj
T*(during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions of uranium )Tj
T*(compounds left in the soil \(see Gulf War Syndrome\).[11] )Tj
T*( Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used )Tj
T*(to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is )Tj
T*(radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting )Tj
T*(radiation from strong sources such as radium.[8] Other uses of DU include )Tj
T*(counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry )Tj
T*(vehicles and as a shielding material.[9] Due to its high density, this material )Tj
T*(is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses.[9] DU is )Tj
T*(preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined )Tj
T*(and cast as well as its relatively low cost.[13] Counter to popular )Tj
T*(belief[citation needed], the main risk of exposure to DU is chemical poisoning )Tj
T*(by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity \(uranium being only a weak alpha )Tj
T*(emitter\). )Tj
T*( During the later stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, and to a lesser )Tj
T*(extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material )Tj
T*(to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were )Tj
T*(built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated )Tj
T*(mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more )Tj
T*(complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb \(thermonuclear )Tj
T*(weapon\) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of )Tj
T*(tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a )Tj
T*(non-fissile \(unenriched\) uranium case, and they derive more than half their )Tj
T*(power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear )Tj
T*(fusion process.[14] )Tj
T*( Civilian )Tj
T*( The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power )Tj
T*(plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 80Â )Tj
T*(terajoules of energy \(8Ã—1013Â joules\), assuming complete fission; as much energy )Tj
T*(as 3000 tonnes of coal.[6] )Tj
T*( Commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around )Tj
T*(3% uranium-235.[6] The CANDU and Magnox designs are the only commercial )Tj
T*(reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel. Fuel used for United States )Tj
T*(Navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium-235 \(the exact values are )Tj

T*( Before the discovery of radioactivity, uranium was primarily used in small )Tj

T*(radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of )Tj
T*(these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, )Tj
T*(rather than alpha emission. )Tj
T*( Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a half-life of about )Tj
T*(4.468Ã—109 years, roughly the age of the Earth. Uranium-235 has a half-life of )Tj
T*(about 7.13Ã—108 years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48Ã—105 )Tj
T*(years.[74] For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by each )Tj
T*(of 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U \(since the latter is formed from the former\) )Tj
T*(and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, probably about )Tj
T*(one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was )Tj
T*(probably much lower than this. )Tj
T*( Uranium-238 is usually an Î± emitter \(occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous )Tj
T*(fission\), decaying through the "Uranium Series" of nuclear decay, which has 18 )Tj
T*(members, all of which eventually decay into lead-206, by a variety of different )Tj

T*(three fragments \(fission products\) by thermal neutrons.[10] )Tj

T*(Peripheral Characters". )Tj
T*( [edit] Role in The Simpsons )Tj
T*( Troy McClure is a stereotypical Hollywood has-been.[2] He was a star in the )Tj
T*(early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of a paraphilia )Tj
T*(involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video )Tj
T*(clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often )Tj
T*(presents educational videos[3][4] and infomercials.[5] McClure introduces )Tj
T*(himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, )Tj
T*(educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...," mentioning two titles that are )Tj
T*(similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode "Bart the )Tj
T*(Mother", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy )Tj
T*(McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as Earwigs: Eww! and Man )Tj
T*(vs. Nature: The Road to Victory."[6] )Tj
T*( McClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode "A Fish )Tj
T*(Called Selma". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma )Tj
T*(Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of )Tj
T*(Motor Vehicles. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in )Tj
T*(Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a stage musical version of the )Tj
T*(film Planet of the Apes. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent )Tj
T*(suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts )Tj
T*(his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a Modernist building which )Tj
T*(resembles the Chemosphere. At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer )Tj
T*(Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing )Tj
T*(at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to Marge, )Tj
T*(who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but )Tj
T*(she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair to have a child )Tj
T*(\(since "all the big parts these days are going to family men"\). Having a child )Tj
T*(will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal )Tj
T*(Discharge, but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship )Tj
T*(and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it )Tj
T*(down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox )Tj
T*(film called The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.[7] )Tj
T*( In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of "The )Tj
T*(Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" and "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase". The )Tj
T*(first is a behind the scenes look at The Simpsons, answering questions and )Tj
T*(featuring extra "never before seen" material.[8] The second is an episode )Tj
T*(presenting three possible spin-offs from The Simpsons.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] In other media )Tj
T*( McClure was made into an action figure as part of the World of Springfield toy )Tj
T*(line, and was released in the "Celebrity Series 1" wave.[10] He also features )Tj
T*(briefly in the video game Virtual Springfield, introducing the town of )Tj
T*(Springfield to the player.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Character )Tj
T*( [edit] Creation )Tj
T*( McClure was based on the typical "washed up" Hollywood actor. B movie actors )Tj
T*(Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain )Tj
T*(character aspects.[1][12] Writer Mike Reiss later met Doug McClure's daughter, )Tj
T*(who revealed that her father had found the homage funny. His children would )Tj
T*(call their father "Troy McClure" when his back was turned.[1] According to show )Tj
T*(creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to )Tj
T*(pull "the maximum amount of humor" out of any line he was given.[12] McClure's )Tj
T*(visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself.[13] When he was )Tj
T*(designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the )Tj
T*(character had gotten a facelift.[14] )Tj
T*( In a very brief appearance in the season 2 episode "Bart's Dog Gets an F", )Tj
T*(Troy was voiced by Dan Castellaneta.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Development )Tj
T*( According to executive producer Al Jean, the writers often used McClure as a )Tj
T*("panic button" and added the character when they felt an episode needed more )Tj

T*(humor.[16] McClure's character is most developed in "A Fish Called Selma", )Tj
T*(which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory.[2]Show )Tj
T*(runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Phil Hartman, and wished to )Tj
T*(make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do )Tj
T*(as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to Selma Bouvier, as )Tj
T*(she was "always marrying people".[2] Animator Mark Kirkland was particularly )Tj
T*(pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting )Tj
T*(Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other )Tj
T*(animators to "open [McClure] up visually as a character".[2] Throughout "A Fish )Tj
T*(Called Selma", it is hinted that McClure has strange sexual behavior. The )Tj
T*(writers did not initially know what the "unsavory" sexual preference would be, )Tj
T*(but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive )Tj
T*(producer James L. Brooks. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as )Tj
T*("so perverted and strange, it was over the top".[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Retirement )Tj
T*( After Hartman's death in 1998,[17] rather than replace him with a new voice )Tj
T*(actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other )Tj
T*(recurring character, Lionel Hutz, from the show.[12] McClure last appeared in )Tj
T*(the season ten episode "Bart the Mother", which was dedicated to Hartman.[18] )Tj
T*(Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a )Tj
T*(live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's )Tj
T*(writers.[19] He noted that he was "looking forward to his live-action movie, )Tj
T*(publicizing [McClure's] Betty Ford appearances."[20]Matt Groening later told )Tj
T*(Empire that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm", but "would have been )Tj
T*(really fun".[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception and cultural influence )Tj
T*( Even after his retirement, Troy McClure remains a popular supporting )Tj
T*(character. IGN ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the "Top 25 Simpsons )Tj
T*(Peripheral Characters", calling him "a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining )Tj
T*(character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can )Tj
T*(be".[22] In a 2007 article on Simpsons guest stars, Adam Finley of TV Squad )Tj
T*(wrote that McClure was "responsible for some of the funniest moments in )Tj
T*(Simpsons history".[23] Hartman ranked first on AOL's list of their favorite 25 )Tj
T*(Simpsons guest stars.[24]Chris Turner argues in Planet Simpson that McClure and )Tj
T*(Lionel Hutz "together...represent the most significant contribution to the show )Tj
T*(outside of its permanent cast", adding that "the show's Golden Age is hard to )Tj
T*(imagine without them". He continues, "The smarmy Hollywood type...has been done )Tj
T*(to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. )Tj
T*(McClure has become the apotheosis of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny )Tj
T*(reinterpretation whose trademark introduction...has become a shorthand way to )Tj
T*(describe any grossly artificial media figure."[25] )Tj
T*( McClure's most prominent episode, "A Fish Called Selma", is often regarded as )Tj
T*(one of the best episodes in the show's history, and is a favorite of many staff )Tj
T*(members.[2]Entertainment Weekly placed the episode eighth on their top 25 The )Tj
T*(Simpsons episode list,[26] and IGN named the episode the best of the seventh )Tj
T*(season, calling it the "obvious pick". They also deemed McClure's Planet of the )Tj
T*(Apes musical the best moment of the episode and "maybe even the whole )Tj
T*(show".[27] )Tj
T*( McClure was one of Phil Hartman's best known-roles. He often used his McClure )Tj
T*(voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of )Tj
T*(NewsRadio. He remarked, "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans."[28] He added )Tj
T*("It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation. I do it )Tj
T*(for the pure love of it."[29] When Hartman was murdered in 1998, many )Tj
T*(obituaries mentioned his work as McClure as one of the highlights of his )Tj
T*(career.[30][31][32][33] The BBC said that "[Hartman's] voice was known to )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The discovery of iridium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other )Tj
T*(metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used by ancient Ethiopians[25] )Tj
T*(and by South American cultures[26] always contained a small amount of the other )Tj
T*(platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as platina )Tj
T*(\("small silver"\), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a )Tj
T*(region today known as the department of ChocÃ³ in Colombia.[27] The discovery )Tj
T*(that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new )Tj
T*(element, did not occur until 1748.[28] )Tj
T*( Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia \(a mixture of )Tj
T*(hydrochloric and nitric acids\) to create soluble salts. They always observed a )Tj
T*(small amount of a dark, insoluble residue.[3]Joseph Louis Proust thought that )Tj

T*( Edward Drinker Cope \(July 28, 1840 â€“ April 12, 1897\) was an American )Tj
T*(paleontologist and comparative anatomist, as well as a noted herpetologist and )Tj
T*(ichthyologist. He was a founder of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought. Born )Tj
T*(to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy )Tj
T*(interested in science; he published his first scientific paper at the age of )Tj
T*(nineteen. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he )Tj
T*(eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations. Cope married his )Tj
T*(cousin and had one child; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield, )Tj
T*(New Jersey, although Cope would maintain a residence and museum in Philadelphia )Tj
T*(in his later years. )Tj
T*( Cope had little formal scientific training, and he eschewed a teaching )Tj
T*(position for field work. He made regular trips to the American West prospecting )Tj
T*(in the 1870s and 1880s, often as a member of United States Geological Survey )Tj
T*(teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh )Tj
T*(led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone )Tj
T*(Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the )Tj
T*(1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a )Tj
T*(resurgence in his career toward the end of his life before dying of )Tj
T*(unidentified causes on April 12, 1897. )Tj
T*( Though Cope's scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him, his contributions )Tj
T*(helped to define the field of American paleontology. He was a prodigious )Tj
T*(writer, with 1,400Â papers published over his lifetime, although his rivals )Tj
T*(debated the accuracy of his rapidly published works. He discovered, described, )Tj
T*(and named more than 1,000Â vertebrate species including hundreds of fishes and )Tj
T*(dozens of dinosaurs. His proposals on the origin of mammalian molars and for )Tj
T*(the gradual enlargement of mammalian species over geologic time \("Cope's rule"\) )Tj
T*(are notable among his theoretical contributions. )Tj

T*(Hanna Cope.[2] The death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to )Tj
T*(have had little effect on young Edward, as he mentioned in his letters that he )Tj
T*(had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal )Tj
T*(role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James )Tj

T*(and gardens. Cope's interest in animals became apparent at a young age, as did )Tj
T*(his natural artistic ability.[1] )Tj
T*( Alfred intended to give his son the same education that he himself had )Tj
T*(received.[5] At age nine, Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia and )Tj
T*(in 1853 at the age of twelve, Edward was sent to the Friends' Boarding School )Tj
T*(or Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania.[6] The school was founded in 1799 )Tj
T*(with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends \(Quakers\), and provided )Tj
T*(much of the Cope family's education.[5] The prestigious school was expensive, )Tj
T*(costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year Edward studied )Tj
T*(algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin.[7] )Tj
T*(Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to )Tj
T*(manipulate his father, and that he was, according to author and Cope biographer )Tj
T*(Jane Davidson, "a bit of a spoiled brat".[8] His letters suggest that he was )Tj
T*(lonely at the schoolâ€”it was the first time he had been away from his home for )Tj
T*(an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical )Tj
T*(boyâ€”he consistently had "less than perfect" or "not quite satisfactory" marks )Tj
T*(for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, )Tj
T*(which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult.[7] )Tj
T*( Edward returned to Westtown in 1855, accompanied by two of his sisters. )Tj
T*(Biology began to interest him more that year, and he studied natural history )Tj
T*(texts in his spare time. While at the school he frequently visited the Academy )Tj
T*(of Natural Sciences. Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad )Tj
T*(conduct. His letters to his father show that he chafed at farm work and )Tj
T*(betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known.[9] )Tj
T*(After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred )Tj
T*(did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead Alfred attempted to )Tj
T*(turn his son into a gentleman farmer, which he considered a wholesome )Tj
T*(profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life,[10] and )Tj
T*(improve the undersized Edward's health.[11][n 1] Until 1863, Cope's letters to )Tj
T*(his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional )Tj
T*(scientific career than that of a farmer, which he called "dreadfully )Tj

T*( While working on farms, Edward continued his education on his own.[12] In 1858 )Tj
T*(he began working part-time at the Academy of Natural Sciences, reclassifying )Tj
T*(and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results )Tj
T*(in January 1859. Cope began taking French and German classes with a former )Tj
T*(Westtown teacher. Though Alfred resisted his son's pursuit of a science career, )Tj
T*(he paid for his son's private studies.[12] Instead of working the farm his )Tj
T*(father bought for him, Edward rented out the land and used the income to )Tj
T*(further his scientific endeavors.[13] )Tj
T*( Alfred finally gave in to Edward's wishes and paid for university classes. )Tj
T*(Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic )Tj
T*(years,[14][n 2] studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, one of the )Tj
T*(most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time.[15] Cope asked his )Tj
T*(father to pay for a tutor in both German and French, "not so much for their own )Tj
T*(sake," wrote Edward, "but as for their value in enabling me to read their books )Tj
T*(of a literary or scientific character."[16] During this period he had a job )Tj
T*(recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, )Tj
T*(which he became a member of at Leidy's urging.[17] Cope's job lasted two years )Tj
T*(and he visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became )Tj
T*(acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology )Tj
T*(and ichthyology.[18] In 1861 he published his first paper on Salamandridae )Tj
T*(classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and )Tj
T*(amphibians.[19] Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and )Tj

T*(time. Initially, Edward seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, )Tj
T*(but in letters to his father later on in the war this aspiration seemed to )Tj
T*(disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist )Tj
T*(freed African-Americans. Davidson suggests that Edward's correspondence with )Tj
T*(Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might )Tj
T*(have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation.[21] Edward was involved )Tj
T*(in a love affair; his father did not approve.[22] Whether Edward or the unnamed )Tj
T*(woman \(whom he at one point intended to marry\) broke off the relationship is )Tj
T*(unknown, but he took the breakup poorly.[23] Biographer and paleontologist )Tj
T*(Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a )Tj
T*(method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War.[24] Cope did write )Tj
T*(to his father from London on February 11, 1864, that, "I shall get home in time )Tj
T*(to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I )Tj
T*(know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe )Tj
T*(to avoid the war."[25] Eventually Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited )Tj
T*(out the conflict.[21] He may have suffered from mild depression during this )Tj
T*(period, and often complained of boredom.[23][n 3] )Tj
T*( Despite his torpor, Edward proceeded with his tour of Europe, and met with )Tj
T*(some of the most highly esteemed scientists of the world during his travels )Tj
T*(through France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Austria, Italy, and Eastern )Tj
T*(Europe, most likely with introductory letters from Leidy and Spencer Baird.[26] )Tj
T*(In the winter of 1863, Edward met Othniel Charles Marsh while in Berlin. Marsh, )Tj
T*(age thirty-two, was attending the University of Berlin. He held two university )Tj
T*(degrees in comparison to Edward's lack of formal schooling past sixteen, but )Tj
T*(Edward had written 37Â scientific papers in comparison to Marsh's two published )Tj
T*(works.[27] While they would later become rivals, on meeting the two men )Tj
T*(appeared to take a liking to each other. Marsh led Edward on a tour of the )Tj
T*(city, and they stayed together for days. After Edward left Berlin the two )Tj
T*(maintained correspondence, exchanging manuscripts, fossils, and )Tj
T*(photographs.[27] Edward burned many of his journals and letters from Europe )Tj
T*(upon his return to the United States. Friends intervened and stopped Cope from )Tj
T*(destroying some of his drawings and notes, in what author Url Lanham deemed a )Tj
T*("partial suicide".[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Family and early career )Tj
T*( Upon returning to Philadelphia in 1864 the Cope family made every effort to )Tj
T*(secure Edward a teaching post as the Professor of Zoology at Haverford College, )Tj
T*(a small Quaker school where the family had philanthropic ties.[29] The college )Tj
T*(awarded him an honorary master's degree so he could have the position. Cope )Tj
T*(even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in the matter, )Tj
T*(telling him of the girl he would like to marry: "an amiable woman, not over )Tj
T*(sensitive, with considerable energy, and especially one inclined to be serious )Tj
T*(and not inclined to frivolity and displayâ€”the more truly Christian of course )Tj
T*(the betterâ€”seems to be the most practically the most suitable for me, though )Tj
T*(intellect and accomplishments have more charm."[29] Cope thought of Annie Pim, )Tj
T*(a member of the Society of Friends, as less a lover than companion, declaring )Tj
T*(that "her amiability and domestic qualities generally, her capability of taking )Tj
T*(care of a house, etc., as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me )Tj
T*(than any of the traits which form the theme of poets!" Cope's family approved )Tj
T*(of his choice, and the marriage took place in July 1865 at Pim's farmhouse in )Tj
T*(Chester County, Pennsylvania.[30] The two had a single daughter, Julia Biddle )Tj
T*(Cope, born June 10, 1866.[31] Cope's return to the United States also marked an )Tj
T*(expansion of his scientific studies; in 1864 he described several fishes, a )Tj
T*(whale, and the amphibian Amphibamus grandiceps \(his first paleontological )Tj
T*(contribution.\)[19] )Tj
T*( During the period between 1866 and 1867 Cope went on trips to western parts of )Tj
T*(the country.[31][32] Cope related to his father his scientific experiences; to )Tj
T*(his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life as part of her education. Cope )Tj
T*(found educating his students at Haverford "a pleasure" but wrote to his father )Tj

T*(fossil beds of western New Jersey. Due to the time-consuming nature of his )Tj
T*(Haverford position Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it )Tj
T*(out to others, but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his )Tj
T*(scientific habits.[34] Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, )Tj
T*(he finally sold the farm in 1869.[35] Alfred apparently did not press his son )Tj
T*(to continue farming, and Edward focused on his scientific career.[36] He )Tj
T*(continued his continental travels, including trips to Virginia, Tennessee, and )Tj
T*(North Carolina.[37] He visited caves across the region. He stopped these cave )Tj
T*(explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana, but remained )Tj
T*(interested in the subject.[38] Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the )Tj
T*(1860s, paying periodical visits to the marl pits. The fossils he found in these )Tj
T*(pits became the focus of several papers, including a description in 1868 of )Tj
T*(Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps. Marsh accompanied him on one of these )Tj
T*(excursions. Cope's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more )Tj
T*(frequent trips possible. The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by )Tj
T*(an apple orchard. Two maids tended the estate, which entertained a number of )Tj
T*(guests. Cope's only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific )Tj
T*(work.[39] )Tj
T*( The 1870s were the golden years of Cope's career, marked by his most prominent )Tj
T*(discoveries and rapid flow of publications. Among his descriptions were the )Tj
T*(therapsid Lystrosaurus \(1870\),[40] the archosauromorph Champsosaurus )Tj
T*(\(1876\),[41] and the sauropod Amphicoelias \(1878\),[42] possibly the largest )Tj
T*(dinosaur ever discovered.[43] In the period of one year, from 1879 to 1880, )Tj
T*(Cope published 76Â papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado, )Tj
T*(and on the findings of his collectors in Texas, Kansas, Oregon, Colorado, )Tj
T*(Wyoming and Utah.[44] During the peak years, Cope published around 25Â reports )Tj
T*(and preliminary observations each year. The hurried publications led to errors )Tj
T*(in interpretation and namingâ€”many of his scientific names were later canceled )Tj
T*(or withdrawn. In comparison, Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more )Tj
T*(succinctlyâ€”his work's appearance in the widespread American Journal of Science )Tj
T*(led to faster reception abroad, and subsequently Marsh's reputations grew )Tj
T*(faster than Cope.[45] )Tj
T*( In autumn 1871 Cope began prospecting farther west to the fossil fields of )Tj
T*(Kansas. Leidy and Marsh had been to the region earlier, and Cope employed one )Tj
T*(of Marsh's guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job.[46] Cope's )Tj
T*(companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available )Tj
T*(to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a "severe )Tj
T*(attack of nightmare" in which "every animal of which we had found trace during )Tj
T*(the day played with him at nightÂ ... sometimes he would lose half the night in )Tj
T*(this exhausting slumber." Nevertheless Cope continued to lead the party from )Tj
T*(sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his )Tj
T*(finds.[47] The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself )Tj
T*(till he was bedridden caught up with him and in 1872 he broke down from )Tj
T*(exhaustion.[48] Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting )Tj
T*(and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.[49] )Tj
T*( Throughout the decade Cope traveled across the West, exploring rocks of the )Tj
T*(Eocene in 1872 and the Titanothere Beds of Colorado in 1873.[50][51] In 1874 )Tj
T*(Cope was employed with the Wheeler Survey, a group of surveys led by George )Tj
T*(Montague Wheeler that mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th )Tj
T*(meridian. The survey traveled through New Mexico, whose Puerco formations, he )Tj
T*(wrote to his father, provided "the most important find in geology I have ever )Tj
T*(made".[52] The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and )Tj
T*(subsequent deformation, and were in an area which had not been visited by Leidy )Tj
T*(or Marsh. Being part of the survey had other advantages; Cope was able to draw )Tj
T*(on fort commissaries and defray publishing costs. While there was no salary, )Tj
T*(his findings would be published in the annual reports that the surveys printed. )Tj
T*(Cope brought Annie and Julia along on one such survey and rented a house for )Tj
T*(them at Fort Bridger, but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips )Tj
T*(than he would have liked.[53] )Tj

T*(nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Alfred's death was a blow to Cope; his )Tj
T*(father was a constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of )Tj
T*(Cope's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous )Tj
T*(years. His chief publication of the time, The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous )Tj
T*(Formations of the West, was a collection of 303Â pages and 54Â illustration )Tj
T*(plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and )Tj
T*(Kansas.[55] Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for )Tj
T*(fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial )Tj
T*(Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope's studies of marine reptiles of )Tj
T*(Kansas closed in 1876, opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles.[56] The )Tj
T*(same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in )Tj
T*(Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored )Tj
T*(his growing collection of fossils.[49] Cope's expeditions took him across )Tj
T*(Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. Cope's initial journey into )Tj
T*(the Clarendon Beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an )Tj
T*(affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope's papers on the region )Tj
T*(constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions.[57] In )Tj
T*(1877 he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the )Tj
T*(papers he produced at a rate so high that Marsh questioned their dating.[58][n )Tj
T*(4] )Tj
T*( Cope returned to Europe in August 1878 in response to an invitation to join )Tj
T*(the British Association for the Advancement of Science's Dublin meeting. He was )Tj
T*(warmly welcomed in England and France and met with the distinguished )Tj
T*(paleontologists and archeologists of the period. Marsh's attempts to sully )Tj
T*(Cope's reputation had made little impact on anyone save paleontologist Thomas )Tj
T*(Henry Huxley, who according to Osborn "alone treated [Cope] with coolness".[59] )Tj
T*(Following the Dublin meeting, Cope spent two days with the French Association )Tj
T*(for the Advancement of Science. At each gathering Cope exhibited dinosaur )Tj
T*(restorations by Philadelphia colleague John A. Ryder and various charts and )Tj
T*(plates from geological surveys of the 1870s led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. )Tj
T*(He returned to London on October 12, meeting with anatomist Richard Owen, )Tj
T*(ichthyologist Albert GÃ¼nther and paleontologist H. G. Seeley. While in Europe )Tj
T*(Cope purchased a great collection of fossils from Argentina. Cope never found )Tj
T*(time to describe the collection and many of the boxes remained unopened until )Tj
T*(Cope's death.[60] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bone Wars )Tj
T*( Cope's relations with Marsh turned into a competition for fossils between the )Tj
T*(two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's )Tj
T*(return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the )Tj
T*(marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind )Tj
T*(Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that )Tj
T*(Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven.[61] When Marsh was at )Tj
T*(Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil findsâ€”a complete skeleton of a large )Tj
T*(aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neckâ€”he )Tj
T*(commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that )Tj
T*(Cope had put the skull at the end of the vertebra of the tail. Cope was )Tj
T*(outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy )Tj
T*(examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head )Tj
T*(of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had )Tj
T*(already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American )Tj
T*(Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some )Tj
T*(remained with their buyers \(Marsh and Leidy kept theirs\).[62] The whole ordeal )Tj
T*(might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next )Tj
T*(society meeting, not to alienate Cope but only in response to Cope's brief )Tj
T*(statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk )Tj
T*(to each other amicably again, and by 1873 open hostility had broken out between )Tj
T*(them.[63] )Tj
T*( The rivalry between the two increased towards the latter half of the 1870s. In )Tj

T*(his friend, H. C. Beckwith, looking for fossilized leaves in the Dakota )Tj
T*(sandstone. Instead the pair found large bones embedded in the rock.[64] Lakes )Tj
T*(wrote that the bones were "apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some )Tj
T*(gigantic saurian."[65] While Lakes sent Marsh some 1,500 pounds of bone, he )Tj
T*(also sent Cope some of the specimens. Marsh published his finds first, and )Tj
T*(having been paid $100 for the finds Lakes wrote to Cope that the samples should )Tj
T*(be forwarded to Marsh.[66] Cope was offended by the slight.[67] Meanwhile Cope )Tj
T*(received bones from school superintendent O.W. Lucas in March 1877 from Canon )Tj
T*(City; the remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than Lakes' that Marsh had )Tj
T*(described.[66] )Tj
T*( Word that Lakes had notified Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. )Tj
T*(When Marsh heard from Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed )Tj
T*(about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, )Tj
T*(Samuel Wendell Williston, to take charge of the digging.[68] Cope, in response, )Tj
T*(learned of Carlin and Reed's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in )Tj
T*(the area.[69] The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other's progress. )Tj
T*(Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily )Tj
T*(made up for in connectionsâ€”Marsh's uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who )Tj
T*(supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh )Tj
T*(lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden )Tj
T*(to "muzzle" Cope's publishing.[70] Both men tried to spy on the other's )Tj
T*(whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of )Tj
T*(recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in )Tj
T*(New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh.[71] Cope and Marsh were )Tj
T*(extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Osborn, at the time )Tj
T*(a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils )Tj
T*(in the West, Cope politely refused to answer.[72] )Tj
T*( When Cope arrived back in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, )Tj
T*(he had nearly two years of fossil findings from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs )Tj
T*(was Camarasaurus, one of the most recognizable dinosaur recreations of the )Tj
T*(time.[73] The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and )Tj
T*(north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the )Tj
T*(Pacific Ocean.[74] In 1879 the United States Congress consolidated the various )Tj
T*(government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence )Tj
T*(King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an )Tj
T*(old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and )Tj
T*(Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by )Tj
T*(which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later years )Tj
T*( The 1880s proved disastrous for Cope.[75] Marsh's close association with the )Tj
T*(Geological Survey gave him the resources to employ 54Â staff members over the )Tj
T*(course of tenÂ years. His teaching position at Yale meant he had guaranteed )Tj
T*(access to the American Journal of Science for publication. Cope had his )Tj
T*(interest in the Naturalist, but it drained him of funds. After Hayden was )Tj
T*(removed from the Survey, Cope lost his source of government funding. His )Tj
T*(fortune was not enough to support his rivalry, so Cope invested in mining. Most )Tj
T*(of his properties were silver mines in New Mexico; one mine yielded an ore vein )Tj
T*(worth $3Â million in silver chloride. Cope visited the mines each summer from )Tj
T*(1881 to 1885, taking the opportunity to supervise or collect other )Tj
T*(minerals.[76] For a while he made good money, but the mines stopped producing )Tj
T*(and by 1886 he had to give up his now-worthless stocks.[77] The same year he )Tj
T*(received a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania.[78] He )Tj
T*(continued to travel west, but realized he would not be able to best Marsh in )Tj
T*(cornering the market for bones; he had to release the collectors he had hired )Tj
T*(and sell his collections. During this period he published 40 to 75Â papers each )Tj
T*(year.[79] With the failure of his mines, Cope began searching for a job, but )Tj
T*(was turned down at the Smithsonian and American Museum of Natural History. He )Tj
T*(turned to giving lectures for hire and writing magazine articles. Each year he )Tj
T*(lobbied Congress for an appropriation with which to finish his work on "Cope's )Tj

T*(down. Rather than work with Powell and the Survey, Cope tried to inflame )Tj
T*(sentiment against them.[80] )Tj
T*( At Marsh's urging, Powell pushed for Cope to return specimens he had unearthed )Tj
T*(during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to )Tj
T*(Cope, who had used his own money while working as a volunteer.[82] In response, )Tj
T*(Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous )Tj
T*(headline. Since 1885,[83] Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and )Tj
T*(misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From )Tj
T*(scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal )Tj
T*(that he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk.[84] Cope sought out )Tj
T*(Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their )Tj
T*(employer and of being chronically underpaid.[85] Reporter William Hosea Ballou )Tj
T*(ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of )Tj
T*(newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell and Cope.[86] Cope attacked Marsh for )Tj
T*(plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological )Tj
T*(classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds.[87] Marsh )Tj
T*(and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little )Tj
T*(changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged )Tj
T*(misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any )Tj
T*(mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's )Tj
T*(fall from power in the Survey.[88] Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, )Tj
T*(Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's )Tj
T*(relations with the president of the University of Pennsylvania soured, and the )Tj
T*(entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.[89] )Tj
T*( Cope took his sinking fortunes in stride.[75] In writing to Osborn about the )Tj
T*(articles, he laughed at the outcome, saying, "It will now rest largely with you )Tj
T*(whether or not I am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and )Tj
T*(disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius )Tj
T*(sphenocerus."[90] Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to )Tj
T*(name a species after a combination of "Cope" and "hater", Anisonchus )Tj
T*(cophater.[91] Through his years of financial hardship he was able to continue )Tj
T*(publishing papersâ€”his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 )Tj
T*(papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the )Tj
T*(best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in )Tj
T*(1882[92] and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889.[93] In 1889 he succeeded )Tj
T*(Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the )Tj
T*(University of Pennsylvania.[94] The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's )Tj
T*(family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish )Tj
T*(earlier.[95] )Tj
T*( In 1892, Cope \(then 52Â years old\) was granted expense money for field work )Tj
T*(from the Texas Geological Survey.[95] With his finances improved, he was able )Tj
T*(to publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America, which was the )Tj
T*(most detailed analysis and organization of the continent's frogs and amphibians )Tj
T*(ever mastered,[96] and the 1,115-page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of )Tj
T*(North America. In the 1890s his publication rate increased to an average of 43Â )Tj
T*(articles a year.[96] His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when )Tj
T*(he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sights in Texas and )Tj
T*(Oklahoma.[97] The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a )Tj
T*(Haverford astronomy professor. The couple's agesâ€”Julia was 28 and the groom )Tj
T*(35â€”were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European )Tj
T*(honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford as )Tj
T*(well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures )Tj
T*(he gave in Philadelphia. In private correspondence, however, Osborn wrote that )Tj
T*(the two had essentially separated,[98] though they remained on amiable )Tj
T*(terms.[99] )Tj

T*(was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a millionÂ )Tj
T*(dollars.[97] The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological )Tj
T*(artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's )Tj
T*(foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to bad blood between )Tj
T*(Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the )Tj
T*(city.[101] Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to )Tj
T*(prospect for fossils on his behalf.[102] )Tj
T*( In 1896 Cope began suffering from a gastrointestinal illness he said was )Tj
T*(cystitis.[104] His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at )Tj
T*(other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at )Tj
T*(this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his )Tj
T*(fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large )Tj
T*(amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on )Tj
T*(formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions )Tj
T*(and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a )Tj
T*(temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for )Tj
T*(fossils, became ill again, and returned to his home very weak.[105] Osborn )Tj
T*(visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick )Tj
T*(paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word )Tj
T*(of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in )Tj
T*(a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April )Tj
T*(12, 1897, sixteen weeks short of his 57th birthday.[106] )Tj
T*( Sternberg, still prospecting for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman )Tj
T*(who relayed word from Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg )Tj
T*(wrote in his memoirs that "I had lost friends before, and I had known what it )Tj
T*(was to bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more )Tj
T*(deeply than I did over the news."[106] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six )Tj
T*(men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor )Tj
T*(Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood and Harrison Allen. The six sat around )Tj
T*(Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a gila monster, )Tj
T*(for what Osborn called "a perfect Quaker silenceÂ ... an interminable length of )Tj
T*(time."[105][106] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and )Tj
T*(read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, "These are the problems )Tj
T*(to which our friend devoted his life."[107] )Tj
T*( The coffin was loaded on a hearse and carried to a gathering at Fairfield; )Tj
T*(much of the gathering was spent in silence. After the coffin was removed, the )Tj
T*(assembled began talking. Frazer recalled that each person remembered Cope )Tj
T*(differently, and that "Few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyoneÂ ... )Tj
T*(all the sides of his multiform character."[107] Osborn, intending to follow the )Tj
T*(coffin to the graveyard, was instead pulled aside by Collins and taken to the )Tj
T*(reading of Cope's willâ€”Osborn and Cope's brother-in-law John Garrett were named )Tj
T*(executors. Cope gave his family a choice of his books, with the remainder to be )Tj
T*(sold or donated to the University of Pennsylvania. After debts were handled, )Tj
T*(Cope left small bequests to friends and familyâ€”Anna Brown and Julia received )Tj
T*($5000 each, while the remainder went to Annie. Cope's estate was valued at )Tj
T*($75,327, not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to the )Tj
T*(American Museum of Natural History, for a total of $84,600.[108] Some specimens )Tj
T*(preserved in alcohol made their way to the Academy of Natural Sciences, )Tj
T*(including a few gordian worms.[109] )Tj
T*( Cope insisted through his will that there be no graveside service or burial; )Tj
T*(he had donated his body to science. He issued a final challenge to Marsh at his )Tj
T*(death: he had his skull donated to science so that his brain could be measured, )Tj
T*(hoping that his brain would be larger than that of his adversary; at the time, )Tj
T*(it was thought that brain size was the true measure of intelligence. Marsh )Tj
T*(never accepted the challenge, and Cope's skull is reportedly still preserved at )Tj
T*(the University of Pennsylvania.[110][111] His ashes were placed at the )Tj
T*(institute with those of Leidy, while his bones were extracted and kept in a )Tj
T*(locked drawer to be studied by anatomy students.[112][n 5] )Tj

T*(by a medical doctor at the university. Dr. Morrie Kricun, a professor of )Tj
T*(radiology, concluded that there was no evidence of bony syphilis on Cope's )Tj
T*(skeleton.[113] )Tj
T*( Public mentions of Cope's passing were relatively slight. The Naturalist ran )Tj
T*(four photographs, a six-page obituary by editor J. S. Kingsley, and a two-page )Tj
T*(remembrance by Frazer. The National Academy of Sciences' official memoir was )Tj
T*(submitted years later and written by Osborn. The American Journal of Science )Tj
T*(devoted six paragraphs to Cope's passing, and incorrectly gave his age as 46. )Tj
T*(Cope was survived by his rival Marsh, who was suffering poor health.[114] )Tj
T*( [edit] Evolution )Tj
T*( As a young man, Cope read Charles Darwin's Voyage of a Naturalist, which had )Tj
T*(little effect on him. The only comment about Darwin's book recorded by Cope was )Tj
T*(that Darwin discussed "too much geology" from the account of his voyage.[115] )Tj
T*(Due to his background in taxonomy and paleontology, Cope focused on evolution )Tj
T*(in terms of changing structure, rather than emphasizing geography and variation )Tj
T*(within populations as Darwin had. Over his lifetime Cope's views on evolution )Tj
T*(shifted.[116] )Tj
T*( His original view, described in the paper "On the Origin of Genera" \(1868\), )Tj
T*(held that while Darwin's natural selection may affect the preservation of )Tj
T*(superficial characteristics in organisms, natural selection alone could not )Tj
T*(explain the formation of genera. Cope's suggested mechanism for this action was )Tj
T*(a "steady progressive development of organization" through what Cope termed "a )Tj
T*(continual crowding backward of the successive steps of individual development". )Tj
T*(In Cope's view, during embryological development an organism could complete )Tj
T*(their growth with a new stage of development beyond its parents, taking it to a )Tj
T*(higher level of organization. Later individuals would inherit this new level of )Tj
T*(developmentâ€”thus evolution was a continuous advance of organization, sometimes )Tj
T*(slowly and other times suddenly; this view is known as the law of )Tj
T*(acceleration.[117] )Tj
T*( Cope's beliefs later evolved to one with an increased emphasis on continual )Tj
T*(and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator.[118] He became )Tj
T*(one of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought, which holds that )Tj
T*(individuals can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring.[119] )Tj
T*(Although the view has been shown incorrect, it was the prevalent theory among )Tj
T*(paleontologists in Cope's time.[120] In 1887, Cope published his own "Origin of )Tj
T*(the Fittest: Essays in Evolution", detailing his views on the subject.[121] He )Tj
T*(was a strong believer in the law of use and disuseâ€”that an individual will )Tj
T*(slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will )Tj
T*(become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. The )Tj
T*(giraffe, for example, stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this )Tj
T*(acquired characteristic to its offspring in the new developmental phase that is )Tj
T*(added on to the fetus in the womb. This new stage of sharing of genetics would )Tj
T*(be added on after all gestation is completed and the offspring is ready to be )Tj
T*(conceived.[122] )Tj
T*( Cope's Theology of Evolution \(1887\) argued that consciousness comes from the )Tj
T*(mind of the universe and governs evolution by directing animals to new )Tj
T*(goals.[123] According to \(Sideris, 2003\) "[Cope] argued that organisms respond )Tj
T*(to changes in their environments by an exercise of choice. Consciousness )Tj
T*(itself, he maintained, was the principal force in evolution. Cope credited God )Tj
T*(with having built into evolution a life force that propelled organisms toward )Tj
T*(even higher levels of consciousness."[124] )Tj

T*(former friend called, "Cope's mouth the filthiest, from hearsay that in )Tj
T*([Cope's] heyday no woman was safe within fiveÂ miles of him."[126] As Julia was )Tj
T*(the major financier behind The Master Naturalist, she wanted to keep her )Tj
T*(father's name in good standing and refused to comment on any misdeeds her )Tj
T*(father may have committed.[126] )Tj
T*( Cope was described by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as "a man of medium height )Tj
T*(and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity". To him, )Tj
T*(Fowler wrote, "[Cope] was both genial and always interesting, easily )Tj
T*(approachable, and both kindly and helpful."[127] His self-taught nature, )Tj
T*(however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had )Tj
T*(a famous temper; one friend called Cope a "militant paleontologist".[128] )Tj
T*(Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American )Tj
T*(paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, "[Cope's] little slips from virtue were )Tj
T*(those we might make ourselves, were we bolder".[129] )Tj
T*( Cope was raised as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. )Tj
T*(Although he never confronted his family about their religious views, Osborn )Tj
T*(writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific )Tj
T*(career and his religion. Osborn writes: "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts )Tj
T*(about the literalness of the BibleÂ ... he did not express them in his letters )Tj
T*(to his family but there can be little questionÂ ... that he shared the )Tj
T*(intellectual unrest of the period."[130] Lanham writes that Cope's religious )Tj
T*(fervor \(which seems to have subsided after his father's death\) was embarrassing )Tj
T*(to even his devout Quaker associates.[120] Biographer Jane Davidson believes )Tj
T*(that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's )Tj
T*(deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain )Tj
T*(his father's financial support.[131] Frazer's reminiscences about his friend )Tj
T*(suggest that Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than )Tj
T*(Cope's true views.[21] )Tj
T*( Cope's views on human races would today be considered racist, but his beliefs )Tj
T*(were used by scientists of the time as an excuse for imperialism. He believed )Tj
T*(that if, "a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like".[132] He )Tj
T*(was not opposed to blacks because of the color of their skin but their )Tj
T*("degrading vices," believing that the "inferior Negro should go back to )Tj
T*(Africa."[133] He did not blame blacks for their perceived "poor virtue", but )Tj
T*(wrote that, "A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by )Tj
T*(every kind of cleaner food. It is the nature of the bird."[134] Cope was )Tj
T*(against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as )Tj
T*(protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage as he felt they would be unduly )Tj
T*(influenced by their husbands.[133] )Tj
T*( In fewer than 40Â years as a scientist Cope published over 1,400Â scientific )Tj
T*(papers, a record that stands to this day.[135][136] These include three major )Tj
T*(volumes: On the Origin of Genera \(1867\), The Vertebrata of the Tertiary )Tj
T*(Formations of the West \(1884\) and "Essays in Evolution". He discovered a total )Tj
T*(of 56Â new dinosaur species during the Bone Wars compared to Marsh's 80.[137] )Tj
T*(Although Cope is today known as a herpetologist and paleontologist, his )Tj
T*(contributions extended to ichthyology, in which he catalogued 300Â species of )Tj
T*(fishes over three decades.[138] In total he discovered and described over 1,000Â )Tj
T*(species of fossil vertebrates and published 600Â separate titles.[139] )Tj
