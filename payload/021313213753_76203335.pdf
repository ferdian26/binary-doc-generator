T*( Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, FRS, FRCS \(3 April 1911Â â€“ 10 March 2001\) )Tj
T*(was an English surgeon and scientist principally remembered for his research )Tj
T*(into organ transplantation. Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in )Tj
T*(Australia, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine. )Tj
T*(Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he )Tj
T*(joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese )Tj
T*(forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an )Tj
T*(ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent )Tj
T*(malnutrition among his fellow POWs. )Tj
T*( At the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long )Tj
T*(career as an academic surgeon, mixing clinical work and research. Woodruff )Tj
T*(principally studied transplant rejection and immunosuppression. His work in )Tj
T*(these areas of transplantation biology, led Woodruff to perform the first )Tj
T*(kidney transplant in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his )Tj
T*(other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a Fellow of the Royal )Tj
T*(Society in 1968 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1969. Although retiring from )Tj
T*(surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific )Tj
T*(community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and )Tj
T*(scientific organizations. He died on 10 March 2001, at the age of 89. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Michael Woodruff was born on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England.[2] In )Tj
T*(1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a professor of veterinary medicine at the )Tj
T*(Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could )Tj
T*(take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the )Tj
T*(Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later )Tj
T*(became the Professor of Bacteriology.[2] The family's new life in Australia was )Tj
T*(interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed )Tj
T*(services. He became an officer in the Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was )Tj
T*(sent to Egypt.[2] )Tj
T*( The remainder of the Woodruffs returned to London, and the two boys lived with )Tj
T*(their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in Finchley. )Tj
T*(However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their )Tj
T*(mother, Margaret, died of a staphylococcal septicaemia. The two then spent a )Tj
T*(short time under the care of an aunt before being rejoined by their father in )Tj
T*(1917.[2][3] )Tj
T*( In 1919, Harold remarried and his new wife raised the children from his first )Tj
T*(marriage. The two boys did their early schooling at Trinity Grammar School in )Tj
T*(Melbourne. From then on he spent all of his youth in Australia except for a )Tj
T*(year in Europe in 1924 when his father went on sabbatical leave at Paris's )Tj
T*(Pasteur Institute. During this time, Woodruff and his brother boarded at )Tj
T*(Queen's College in Taunton, Somerset on the south coast of England. The )Tj
T*(headmaster at the school derogatorily regarded Australians as "colonials" who )Tj
T*(were "backward" and put Woodruff in a year level one year lower than )Tj
T*(appropriate.[4] Upon returning to Australia, Woodruff attended the private )Tj
T*(Methodist Wesley College, where he enjoyed mathematics and rowing.[4] )Tj
T*( He won a government scholarship to the University of Melbourne and Queen's )Tj
T*(College, a university residential college.[4] Woodruff studied electrical )Tj
T*(engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential )Tj
T*(physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor.[2] Despite success in engineering, )Tj
T*(Woodruff decided that he would have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia )Tj
T*(because of the Great Depression.[1] He decided to take up medical studies at )Tj
T*(the end of his third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to )Tj
T*(finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as )Tj
T*(an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class )Tj
T*(honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class )Tj
T*(honours.[4] )Tj
T*( After graduating in 1933, he entered the medical program at the University of )Tj
T*(Melbourne. His mentors included Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. While at )Tj
T*(the University, he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in )Tj

T*(1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in )Tj
T*(Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with )Tj
T*(honours as well as two prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal )Tj
T*(medicine for one more year, and served as a house surgeon at the Royal )Tj
T*(Melbourne Hospital.[2] Woodruff then started his surgical training.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] World War II )Tj
T*( At the outbreak of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical )Tj
T*(Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in )Tj
T*(1941. At that time, he was assigned to the Tenth Australian Army General )Tj
T*(Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, )Tj
T*(his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific )Tj
T*(was yet to began in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor )Tj
T*(changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he )Tj
T*(worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General )Tj
T*(Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff )Tj
T*(was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British )Tj
T*(personnel.[1][5] )Tj
T*( After being captured, Woodruff was imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. In )Tj
T*(the camp, Woodruff realized that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from )Tj
T*(vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by )Tj
T*(the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the )Tj
T*(Japanese to allow him to take responsibility for the matter, which was )Tj
T*(granted.[5] He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, )Tj
T*(soya beans, rice polishings, and agricultural wastes using old machinery that )Tj
T*(he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods )Tj
T*(through the Medical Research Council titled "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese )Tj
T*(Prison Camps".[3] Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later )Tj
T*(during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As )Tj
T*(the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his )Tj
T*(practise.[5] During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a )Tj
T*(copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin )Tj
T*(allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked )Tj
T*(his interest in doing research on the topic.[5] )Tj
T*( At the conclusion of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue )Tj
T*(his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate )Tj
T*(to Albert Coates. This position was unpaid, so Woodruff accepted an appointment )Tj
T*(was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself.[6] In January 1946, )Tj
T*(Woodruff participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, )Tj
T*(where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great )Tj
T*(impression on Woodruff, and he married her half a year later. The couple were )Tj
T*(research partners for the rest of their lives.[2][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early career )Tj
T*( Soon after his marriage, Woodruff decided to travel to England in order to )Tj
T*(take the second half of the FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no )Tj
T*(guarantee of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to )Tj
T*(Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him )Tj
T*(to return home and work.[7] Before departing, he applied for a position as a )Tj
T*(Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they )Tj
T*(had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passedâ€”a result )Tj
T*(that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of )Tj
T*(his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sheffield )Tj
T*( After passing his exam, Woodruff entered his position at Sheffield, where he )Tj
T*(trained in emergency and elective surgery.[7] Originally, he had planned to do )Tj
T*(surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. )Tj
T*(Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he )Tj
T*(studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a )Tj
T*(transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly )Tj
T*(interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because )Tj
T*(they did not appear to meet with rejection.[7] Woodruff's work with the )Tj

T*(allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of )Tj
T*(transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff )Tj
T*(arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in )Tj
T*(the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, )Tj
T*(beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at )Tj
T*(Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal )Tj
T*(Melbourne Hospital.[2][7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aberdeen )Tj
T*( In 1948, shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne, Woodruff moved )Tj
T*(from Sheffield to the University of Aberdeen where he was given a post as a )Tj
T*(senior lecturer,[1] having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand.[7] )Tj
T*(At Aberdeen, Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill )Tj
T*(Wilson, and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her )Tj
T*(services.[8] He took advantage of this access and his wife's skills as a lab )Tj
T*(assistant to investigate in utero grafts \(tissue grafts performed while the )Tj
T*(recipient was still in the womb\). At the time, the surgical community )Tj
T*(hypothesized that if a recipient were given in utero grafts, he would be able )Tj
T*(to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection. )Tj
T*(Woodruff's experiments with rats, however, produced negative results.[9] )Tj
T*(Woodruff also commenced work on antilymphocyte serum for immunosuppression, )Tj
T*(with little initial success.[9] )Tj
T*( While in Aberdeen, Woodruff also visited the United States on a World Health )Tj
T*(Organization \(WHO\) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met many of the )Tj
T*(leading American surgeons, an experience that increased his own desire to )Tj
T*(continue his work and research. After returning from the US, Woodruff )Tj
T*(experimented with the effects of cortisone and the impact of blood antigen on )Tj
T*(rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, Woodruff found two volunteers )Tj
T*(with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts. )Tj
T*(When the grafts were rejected, Woodruff determined that rejection must be )Tj
T*(controlled by additional factors.[2][9] In 1951 Woodruff was bestowed a )Tj
T*(Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his )Tj
T*(lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical )Tj
T*(application.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dunedin )Tj
T*( In 1953, Woodruff moved to Dunedin to take up a position as the Chair of )Tj
T*(Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's )Tj
T*(only medical school at that time.[9] Woodruff had earlier failed in his )Tj
T*(applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St )Tj
T*(Andrews University in Edinburgh.[9] While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted )Tj
T*(research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts )Tj
T*(in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of )Tj
T*(Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in )Tj
T*(the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As )Tj
T*(there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible )Tj
T*(for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease )Tj
T*(\(graft versus host disease\).[2] Although Woodruff had been productive in four )Tj
T*(years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there )Tj
T*(were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he )Tj
T*(began to look for an appointment elsewhere.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Edinburgh )Tj
T*( In 1957, Woodruff was appointed to the Chair of Surgical Science at the )Tj
T*(University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview.[10] At the university, )Tj
T*(he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities )Tj
T*(and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who )Tj
T*(went on to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. )Tj
T*(As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a )Tj
T*(Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research )Tj
T*(Council.[10] )Tj
T*( The research group's principal investigations concerned immunological )Tj
T*(tolerance \(the body's acceptance of tissues, as opposed to rejection\), )Tj

T*(autoimmune haemolytic anaemia \(especially in mice\), and immune responses to )Tj
T*(cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular )Tj
T*(surgery program and worked with the use of immunotherapy as a cancer treatment )Tj
T*(as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most )Tj
T*(important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.[2][10] )Tj
T*( Most notably, he performed the first ever kidney transplant in the UK, at the )Tj
T*(Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.[11] Woodruff had been waiting for the right patient )Tj
T*(for some time, hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the )Tj
T*(donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient )Tj
T*(that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely )Tj
T*(impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's )Tj
T*(kidneys on 30 October 1960. Both twins lived an additional six years before )Tj
T*(dying of an unrelated disease.[11] Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant )Tj
T*(with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical )Tj
T*(community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation.[10] From then )Tj
T*(until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants.[10] Also in )Tj
T*(1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a )Tj
T*(comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote.[2] )Tj
T*(He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical )Tj
T*(science.[12] The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of )Tj
T*(Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological )Tj
T*(aspects of individuality'.[13] )Tj
T*( The success of Woodruff's clinical transplant programme was recognised and )Tj
T*(enhanced by funding from the Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the )Tj
T*(Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in )Tj
T*(Edinburgh.[14] In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, )Tj
T*(resulting in the death of several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due )Tj
T*(to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the )Tj
T*(unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop )Tj
T*(a contingency plan to avoid such a disaster in future. The unit then resumed )Tj
T*(operations.[14] )Tj
T*( Woodruff retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1976 and joined the MRC )Tj
T*(Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent the next ten years there, )Tj
T*(engaged in cancer research with an emphasis on tumor immunology using )Tj
T*(Corynebacterium parva. During that time, Woodruff also published twenty-five )Tj
T*(papers and two books.[2] After retiring from his cancer research, Woodruff )Tj
T*(lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally,[3] until his )Tj
T*(death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Woodruff's contributions to surgery were important and long-lasting. In )Tj
T*(addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised a )Tj
T*(method of implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants )Tj
T*(that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient )Tj
T*(transplant unit in Edinburgh that remains one of the world's best. Although )Tj
T*(best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's contributions to the )Tj
T*(study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these )Tj
T*(contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide )Tj
T*(use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the )Tj
T*(current day.[2] )Tj
T*( These important contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously )Tj
T*(honored in 1968 when Woodruff was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. )Tj
T*(The next year, 1969, Woodruff was knighted by the Queen, a rare accomplishment )Tj
T*(for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave Woodruff )Tj
T*(honorary membership, including the American College of Surgeons, the American )Tj
T*(Surgical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. )Tj
T*(Woodruff also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as )Tj
T*(Vice-President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation )Tj
T*(Society. Finally, Woodruff served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a )Tj
T*(visiting professor at a number of universities.[15] )Tj

T*("a commanding presence in any gathering",[16] Woodruff was not known for his )Tj
T*(ability as a lecturer as he had a rather uncertain style of presentation and )Tj
T*(had a tendency to mumble.[16] Nevertheless Morris said that Woodruff has "a )Tj
T*(great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour".[16] Morris concluded )Tj
T*(that "What is surprising is that he was not successful in producing many )Tj
T*(surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering )Tj
T*(surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in )Tj
T*(transplantation at all levels was enormous."[16] )Tj

T*( The Nyon Conference was a diplomatic conference held in Nyon, Switzerland in )Tj
T*(September 1937 to address attacks on international shipping in the )Tj
T*(Mediterranean Sea during the Spanish Civil War. The conference was convened in )Tj
T*(part because Italy had been carrying out unrestricted submarine warfare, )Tj
T*(although the final conference agreement did not accuse Italy directly; instead, )Tj
T*(the attacks were referred to as "piracy" by an unidentified body. Italy was not )Tj
T*(officially at war, nor did any submarine identify itself. The conference was )Tj
T*(designed to strengthen non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The United )Tj
T*(Kingdom and France led the conference, which was also attended by Bulgaria, )Tj
T*(Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. )Tj
T*( The first agreement, signed on 14 September 1937, included plans to )Tj
T*(counterattack aggressive submarines. Naval patrols were established; the United )Tj
T*(Kingdom and France were to patrol most of the western Mediterranean and parts )Tj
T*(of the east, and the other signatories were to patrol their own waters. Italy )Tj
T*(was to be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea if it )Tj
T*(wished. A second agreement followed three days later, applying similar )Tj
T*(provisions to surface ships. Italy and Germany did not attend, although the )Tj
T*(former did take up naval patrols in November. In marked contrast to the )Tj
T*(Non-Intervention Committee and the League of Nations, this conference did )Tj
T*(succeed in preventing attacks by submarines. )Tj
T*( [edit] Context and organisation )Tj
T*( The Non-Intervention Committee, a group of twenty-four nations set up in 1936 )Tj
T*(and based in London, had attempted to restrict the flow of weapons to the )Tj
T*(parties of the Spanish Civil War.[1] For the United Kingdom, it formed part of )Tj
T*(the policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy and aimed at preventing a )Tj
T*(proxy warÂ â€“ with Italy and Germany supporting Franco's Nationalist Coalition on )Tj
T*(one side and the Soviet Union supporting the Republican faction on the otherÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(from escalating into a major pan-European conflict.[2][3] An Anglo-Italian )Tj
T*("Gentleman's Agreement" had been signed on 2 January 1937, with each party )Tj
T*(respecting the rights of the other in the Mediterranean and aimed at improving )Tj
T*(Anglo-Italian relations.[3] In May 1937, Neville Chamberlain succeeded Stanley )Tj
T*(Baldwin as British Prime Minister, and adopted a new policy of dealing directly )Tj

T*(with Germany and Italy.[4] The British believed they could convince Italy to )Tj
T*(abandon Germany through appeasement.[5] )Tj
T*( Under a Non-Intervention Committee plan, neutral observers were posted to )Tj
T*(Spanish ports and borders.[6] The plan also assigned zones of patrol to the )Tj
T*(United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, and patrols began in April.[7] )Tj
T*(Following attacks on the German cruiser Leipzig on 15 and 18 June, Germany and )Tj
T*(Italy withdrew from the patrols.[8][9] The United Kingdom and France offered to )Tj
T*(replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers )Tj
T*(believed these patrols would be too partial.[10] The British Admiralty proposed )Tj
T*(four plans in response to attacks on British shipping, favouring sending )Tj
T*(significant naval resources to the Mediterranean as the best solution;[11] )Tj
T*(previous control measures had been widely evaded.[1] As suspected by the other )Tj
T*(powers, Italy was behind some of these attacks.[12] Whilst officially being at )Tj
T*(peace,[12] the Italian leadership had ordered the commencement of unrestricted )Tj
T*(submarine warfare, referred to in discussion as a campaign of piracy without )Tj
T*(mention of Italy.[11] These plans would be the basis for a Mediterranean )Tj
T*(meeting, suggested by French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos.[11] Meanwhile, on )Tj
T*(the night of 31 August to 1 September, the Italian submarine Iride )Tj
T*(unsuccessfully attacked the British destroyer Havock with torpedoes, between )Tj
T*(the Gulf of Valencia and the Balearic Islands, strengthening British Foreign )Tj
T*(Secretary Anthony Eden's sceptical stance towards Italy.[13] The attack led the )Tj
T*(British representative in Rome to protest to the Italian Minister of Foreign )Tj
T*(Affairs, but without response.[11] )Tj
T*( Up to 60,000 Italian volunteers were now operating in Spain,[14] and the )Tj
T*(removal of foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention )Tj
T*(Committee.[15] Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian )Tj
T*(volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937,[16] and put a moratorium )Tj
T*(on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number )Tj
T*(of volunteers on the 25th.[17] Italy continued to request that belligerent )Tj
T*(rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the )Tj
T*(right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval )Tj
T*(patrols.[18] This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the )Tj
T*(Soviet Union.[19] British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia )Tj
T*(following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was an important issue during )Tj
T*(Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. However, following Eden's )Tj
T*(disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords )Tj
T*(and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian )Tj
T*(sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken )Tj
T*(place.[20] )Tj
T*( On 5 or 6 September, the British arranged a conference for all parties with a )Tj
T*(Mediterranean coastline, along with Germany.[21][22] The conference was to be )Tj
T*(held at Nyon, SwitzerlandÂ â€“ Geneva was avoided because Italians associated it )Tj
T*(with the actions of the League of Nations over the Abyssinian Crisis.[22] The )Tj
T*(United Kingdom agreed to France's request to extend an invitation to the Soviet )Tj
T*(Union, but blocked France's attempt to invite a representative from Republican )Tj
T*(Spain.[21] Portugal expressed surprise at not being invited.[23]Camille )Tj
T*(Chautemps, the new French Prime Minister, opposed direct intervention on the )Tj
T*(Spanish question.[24] The Soviet Union accepted the invitation, indicating that )Tj
T*(it would use the opportunity to blame Italy for the attacks on shipping.[25] )Tj
T*(The Soviet government formally accused the Italians of sinking two Soviet )Tj
T*(merchant vessels, the Tuniyaev and the Blageav,[26] an accusation the Italians )Tj
T*(described as "aggressive and offensive".[27] This was perhaps an attempt by the )Tj
T*(Soviet Union to push Italy and Germany away from the conference.[26] Germany )Tj
T*(rejected the invitation, stating that piracy and other issues the conference )Tj
T*(was to discuss should be handled only by normal meetings of the )Tj
T*(Non-Intervention Committee, not a conference like Nyon.[28] The United Kingdom )Tj
T*(and France rejected this suggestion, and continued to prepare for the )Tj
T*(conference.[26][28] Soon after, the Italians similarly declined. The )Tj
T*(Non-Intervention Committee, it said, also had the advantage of including other )Tj
T*(European powers, notably Poland and Portugal.[29] )Tj

T*( [edit] Provisions )Tj
T*( British and French naval staffs rejected the idea of a convoy system in draft )Tj
T*(proposals. The British wanted to curb submarine activity, on the theory that )Tj
T*(focusing on covert submarine attacks would help avoid confrontation, whereas )Tj
T*(the French considered surface vessels and aircraft just as important. The )Tj
T*(French protested at a plan to create multi-nation squadrons, unhappy at the )Tj
T*(prospect of French ships coming under foreign command.[21] On 8 September, )Tj
T*(plans were discussed in the British Cabinet, including the setting up of eight )Tj
T*(groups of three destroyers for the western Mediterranean. Preliminary talks )Tj
T*(with the French were held on 9 September,[30] and the conference began on the )Tj
T*(10th. Proceedings took two forms: discussions between the British and French, )Tj
T*(and formal meetings of all attending parties. Many of the other nations opposed )Tj
T*(the participation of the Soviet Navy in the Mediterranean,[30] so the United )Tj
T*(Kingdom and France agreed to handle Aegean patrols. This was, perhaps )Tj
T*(surprisingly, accepted by the Soviet Union.[31] )Tj
T*( The conference ended on 14 September with the signing of the "Mediterranean )Tj
T*(Agreement". Signatories were the countries of Bulgaria, Egypt, France, Greece, )Tj
T*(Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the USSR and Yugoslavia. The agreement )Tj
T*(noted attacks on neutral shipping by submarines, in contravention of the London )Tj
T*(Naval Treaty \(signed in 1930\) and the Submarine Protocol, part of the Second )Tj
T*(London Naval Treaty \(signed in 1936\).[32] )Tj
T*( The agreement provided that any submarine that attacked neutral shipping was )Tj
T*(to be sunk if possible, including submarines in the vicinity of a recent attack )Tj
T*(that were determined to be responsible for the attack.[32] French and British )Tj
T*(fleets would patrol the seas west of Malta and attack any suspicious )Tj
T*(submarines,[26] with the division of patrols between the United Kingdom and )Tj
T*(France to be decided by their governments. Both countries would patrol the high )Tj
T*(seas and territorial waters of signatory countries in the Mediterranean.[32] )Tj
T*(The British would provide slightly more than half the 60 destroyers needed, )Tj
T*(with the French providing the remainder and most of the accompanying )Tj
T*(aircraft.[33] It was agreed that Italy could participate in patrols of the )Tj
T*(Tyrrhenian Sea if it wished to do so.[31] In the Eastern Mediterranean, British )Tj
T*(and French ships would patrol up to the Dardanelles, but not in the Adriatic )Tj
T*(Sea. In this area, signatory countries would patrol their own territorial )Tj
T*(waters, and would provide any reasonable assistance to the French and British )Tj
T*(patrols. The future revision of these provisions, including the way the area )Tj
T*(had been divided into zones, was specifically allowed.[32] Submarine activity )Tj
T*(would be banned, subject to two exemptions: travel on the surface accompanied )Tj
T*(by a surface ship, and activity in certain areas for training purposes. )Tj
T*(Governments would only allow foreign submarines into each of their territorial )Tj
T*(waters in extreme situations, such as immediate distress. Merchant shipping )Tj
T*(would also be advised to stick to particular shipping routes.[32] The agreement )Tj
T*(repeated the suggestion that Italy join in the proposal.[34] Delbos announced )Tj
T*(that similar proposals about surface craft would be prepared. The provisions of )Tj
T*(the agreement would come into force on 20 September.[31] The British and French )Tj
T*(knew that the secret Italian submarine operations had already been paused,[30] )Tj
T*(but actions to enforce the conference agreement started at midnight on 19/20 )Tj
T*(September.[31] The delegates to the agreement were happy; The Times likened )Tj
T*(them to cricketers, "reviewing their innings, over by over".[31][35] )Tj
T*( The French and British naval staffs moved to Geneva, where a second agreement )Tj
T*(was signed on 17 September 1937.[36] It extended the rules governing submarine )Tj
T*(warfare to surface vessels, and had the same signatories.[37] Official versions )Tj
T*(of both agreements were published in French and English.[38] Several proposals )Tj
T*(were not implemented: for instance, the British Admiral Ernle Chatfield wanted )Tj
T*(the Spanish parties to be able to verify that the flag a ship was displaying )Tj
T*(was correct, thereby preventing attacks on British shipping if Republican ships )Tj
T*(continued to use the British flag as a means of escape. This would have )Tj
T*(benefited the Nationalists, and the French insisted that this provision be )Tj
T*(dropped. Greece and Turkey wanted ships with a clear identifying mark to be )Tj
T*(excluded, so as to avoid being forced to fire on a German or Italian warship. )Tj

T*(This was rejected, but an amendment was made allowing nations to issue their )Tj
T*(preferred orders in their own territorial waters.[36] A suggestion to fire at )Tj
T*(any attacking aircraft was easily passed. Another suggestion on surface ships )Tj
T*(\(which incorrectly stated no attack had yet been proven\) was eventually )Tj
T*(toughened with the addition of a clause stating aggressors would be attacked, )Tj
T*(at the request of the French. A Soviet proposal strengthening the effect of the )Tj
T*(agreement was made.[36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Meanwhile, on 13 September, Italy was invited to join in the agreement.[39] )Tj
T*(Italy unequivocally rejected it, refusing to patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea. It )Tj
T*(demanded "absolute parity" with the United Kingdom and France, meaning the same )Tj
T*(right of patrol in the Mediterranean.[40][41] Italy subsequently indicated that )Tj
T*(its refusal would be reversed if such parity was granted.[42] Meanwhile, on the )Tj
T*(15th, Benito Mussolini's government sent two submarines to Francisco Franco's )Tj
T*(National Faction.[26] The Soviet Union refused to use routes patrolled by the )Tj
T*(Italians; the Turks, Greeks and Yugoslavs refused to let the Italians use their )Tj
T*(ports.[40] A compromise was signed on 30 September,[43] and Italian patrols )Tj
T*(started on 10 November.[44] The British government, and in particular Neville )Tj
T*(Chamberlain, desired better relations with Italy and these were achieved with )Tj
T*(the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreements of 1938.[37] )Tj
T*( The patrols were a strain on the Royal Navy and the provisions were relaxed )Tj
T*(with French agreement, effective from January. However, submarine activity soon )Tj
T*(returned and full patrols were resumed in early February.[45] On the whole, )Tj
T*(submarine activity during this period did not amount to much; patrols were )Tj
T*(again relaxed in May, and the agreement suspended in August.[46] The success of )Tj
T*(the conference was in marked contrast to the failure of the Non-Intervention )Tj
T*(Committee.[47] However, the Nationalists and Italians switched to using air )Tj
T*(power against shipping;[46] at least one ship was sunk off the Spanish coast by )Tj
T*(aircraft in the final months of 1937.[45] )Tj
T*( In the United Kingdom, Eden described the submarine attacks as savage. He also )Tj
T*(noted that attacks on submarines would be restricted to suitably extreme )Tj
T*(circumstances and that the two parties in the war would still not be able to )Tj
T*(engage neutral vessels.[34] He was keen to avoid an "Anglo-Franco-Soviet )Tj
T*(bloc".[48] The British press was in favour of the agreement, although The Times )Tj
T*(and The Guardian expressed some concerns.[49] British historians, however, have )Tj
T*(tended to see the Nyon Conference as an important stand against aggression, )Tj
T*(with some reservations. Christopher Seton-Watson describes it as a "diplomatic )Tj
T*(victory",[50] but Jill Edwards points out that it failed to achieve a change in )Tj
T*(Italian policy.[51] The agreement created further divisions between Eden as )Tj
T*(foreign minister and Neville Chamberlain as prime minister.[51] )Tj
T*( Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet representative, was pleased with the outcome.[26] )Tj
T*(The agreement also allowed for greater military resources to be deployed to the )Tj
T*(Mediterranean as needed. Litvinov, in particular, stressed the Soviet Union's )Tj
T*("indisputable right" to commit naval forces to the Mediterranean \(something )Tj
T*(Germany and Italy had opposed in meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee\). )Tj
T*(He also said he regretted that Spanish merchant shipping had been left outÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(the other nations believed this would have amounted to formal intervention into )Tj
T*(the civil war.[34]Aretas Akers-Bouglas, Viscount Chilston and British )Tj
T*(Ambassador to the Soviet Union, reported that the Soviets considered the )Tj
T*(conference with "tempered satisfaction", and that they claimed credit for their )Tj
T*(delegation's role.[52] )Tj
T*( Elsewhere, French public opinion was strongly in favour of the outcome of the )Tj
T*(conference,[49] the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican )Tj
T*(ships would not receive direct protection.[53] The German mood was restrained, )Tj
T*(where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols.[54] In )Tj
T*(Spain, the RepublicansÂ â€“ on the verge of disasterÂ â€“ were largely in favour, and )Tj
T*(the Nationalists strongly against.[40] The Republicans praised the improved )Tj
T*(safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent )Tj
T*(rights had not been granted to both sides.[55] The Nationalists made several )Tj
T*(complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of )Tj

T*(competition, after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of )Tj
T*(World War II. Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because )Tj

T*(1936 Games, the International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) decided to award the )Tj
T*(Winter and Summer Games to different countries, but the Games were suspended )Tj
T*(during World War II. London hosted the first post-war Games, the 1948 Summer )Tj

T*(the city council declined.[2] Instead, the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in )Tj
T*(St. Moritz, Switzerland.[3] )Tj
T*( Norwegians were undecided about hosting a Winter Olympics.[4] Culturally they )Tj
T*(were opposed to competitive winter sports, particularly skiing events, despite )Tj
T*(the success of Norwegian athletes at previous Winter Games.[5] But the )Tj
T*(organizers believed the 1952 Games could be an opportunity to promote national )Tj

T*(new hotel constructed, the Viking, used for IOC delegates, out-of-town )Tj
T*(dignitaries, and as the communication hub of the Games.[12][13] For the first )Tj
T*(time in a Winter Games, an indoor ice hockey arena was constructed, which )Tj
T*(hosted the eight-team tournament.[14][15] Oslo's existing central arena, )Tj
T*(Bislett Stadion, was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, and for speed )Tj
T*(skating events. Improvements to the arena included better sound and lighting )Tj
T*(systems, remodeled club house and press rooms, and the addition of a medical )Tj
T*(center.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Politics )Tj
T*( In the aftermath of the German occupation of Norway during World War II, )Tj
T*(anti-German sentiment began to affect preparations for the 1952 Olympics.[17] )Tj
T*(Discussions were held to consider whether Germany should be allowed to )Tj
T*(participate in the Games.[18] When in 1950, the West German Olympic Committee )Tj
T*(requested recognition by the IOC, it raised the question of whether their )Tj
T*(participation would cause political boycotts in the upcoming Games.[19] Once )Tj
T*(the IOC recognized the West German Olympic Committee, West Germany was then )Tj
T*(formally invited to compete at the 1952 Winter Games.[20] East Germany was )Tj
T*(invited to participate with West Germany, as a unified team, but they )Tj
T*(declined.[21] )Tj
T*( At first Norway was reluctant to welcome German athletes, and other Nazi )Tj
T*(sympathizers. For example, Norwegian speed skater Finn Hodt was not allowed to )Tj
T*(compete in the Norwegian speed skating team because he collaborated with the )Tj
T*(Nazis during the war. Eventually, despite the concern, Norway agreed to allow )Tj
T*(German and Japanese athletes to compete.[18] The Soviet Union sent no athletes )Tj
T*(to Oslo, despite being recognized by the IOC. They had intended to enter a team )Tj
T*(in the ice hockey tournament, but applied too late to join the International )Tj
T*(Ice Hockey Federation.[22][23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Events )Tj
T*( [edit] Opening ceremonies )Tj
T*( The opening ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadion on 15 February.[14] King )Tj
T*(George VI of Great Britain had died on 6 February 1952, eight days before the )Tj
T*(start of the Games.[24] As a result, all national flags were flown at )Tj
T*(half-mast, and Princess Ragnhild opened the Games in place of her grandfather, )Tj
T*(King Haakon VII, who was in London attending the funeral.[25] This was the )Tj
T*(first time an Olympic Games had been declared open by a woman.[1] The parade of )Tj
T*(nations was held according to tradition, with Greece first, the rest of the )Tj
T*(nations proceeding by Norwegian alphabetical order, with the host nation )Tj
T*(last.[26] The British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand teams all wore )Tj
T*(black arm bands at the opening ceremonies in memory of their monarch.[27] After )Tj
T*(the parade of nations the Olympic flame was lit.[14] On 13 February, at the )Tj
T*(start of the inaugural Winter Olympics torch relay, the torch was lit in the )Tj
T*(hearth of the Morgedal House, birthplace of skiing pioneer Sondre Norheim.[1] )Tj
T*(The torch relay lasted two days and took place entirely on skis.[1][26] At the )Tj
T*(opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Eigil Nansen, received the Olympic )Tj
T*(torch and skied to a flight of stairs where he removed his skis, ascended, and )Tj
T*(ignited the flame.[28] )Tj
T*( The bobsleigh and alpine skiing events were held the day before the opening )Tj
T*(ceremonies.[29] Competitors in these events were unable to attend the )Tj
T*(festivities in Oslo; consequently simple opening ceremonies were held at )Tj
T*(Frognerseteren, site of the bobsleigh events, and Norefjell, site of the alpine )Tj

T*( [edit] Alpine skiing )Tj
T*( There were three alpine skiing events on the Olympic program: the slalom, )Tj
T*(giant slalom and downhill. Both men and women competed in all three events, )Tj
T*(held at Norefjell and RÃ¸dkleiva.[36] The giant slalom made its Olympic debut at )Tj
T*(the 1952 Games.[37] Austrian skiers dominated the competition, winning seven )Tj
T*(out of a possible 18 medals, including Othmar Schneider who won gold and silver )Tj
T*(in the men's slalom and downhill. Norwegian Stein Eriksen won gold in the men's )Tj
T*(giant slalom and silver in the slalom.[36]Greek slalom skier Antoin Miliordos )Tj
T*(fell 18 times on his run and crossed the finish line backwards.[38] American )Tj
T*(skier Andrea Mead-Lawrence was the only double gold medalist, winning the giant )Tj
T*(slalom and the slalom. She was the first skier from the United States to win )Tj
T*(two alpine skiing gold medals.[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cross-country skiing )Tj
T*( All the cross-country events were held next to the ski jump hill at )Tj
T*(Holmenkollbakken. As had been the case in 1948 there were three men's events: )Tj
T*(18 kilometers, 50 kilometers, and a relay.[40] Added to the Olympic program for )Tj
T*(the first time was a ten-kilometer race for women.[41] All the cross-country )Tj
T*(medals were won by Nordic countries, and Finnish skiers won eight of the twelve )Tj
T*(possible.[40]Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion )Tj
T*(in cross-country skiing; her teammates Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen won )Tj
T*(silver and bronze respectively. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men's )Tj
T*(race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of )Tj
T*(them gold.[41]Hallgeir Brenden won the 18-kilometer race and helped Norway take )Tj
T*(the silver in the 4Â Ã—Â 10-kilometer relay. Brenden went on to win another gold )Tj
T*(in the men's 15-kilometer race in 1956, and a silver in the relay in 1960.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Nordic combined )Tj
T*( The nordic combined event was held at the cross-country and ski jump venues. )Tj
T*(The event started with an 18-kilometer cross-country race. The next day the )Tj

T*( [edit] Figure skating )Tj
T*( There were three events in the Olympic figure skating competition: men's )Tj
T*(singles, women's singles and mixed pairs. The events were held at the Bislett )Tj
T*(Stadion on a rink constructed inside the speed skating track.[50] The collusion )Tj
T*(of judges to influence results was an emerging trend in the years leading up to )Tj
T*(the Oslo Games. Between 1949 and 1952 the International Skating Union had )Tj
T*(banned five judges for attempting to fix scores, although no evidence of )Tj
T*(wrongdoing was found in the judging of the Olympic competitions.[50] )Tj
T*( Dick Button of the United States won the men's singles event. Helmut Seibt of )Tj
T*(Austria took silver and James Grogan of the United States won bronze.[51] )Tj
T*(Button became the first figure-skater to land a triple jump in competition when )Tj
T*(he performed the triple loop in the men's free skate.[52][53] British skater )Tj
T*(Jeannette Altwegg won the gold medal in the women's singles, the silver was )Tj
T*(awarded to American Tenley Albright, who went on to win gold at the 1956 Winter )Tj
T*(Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo,[54] and Jacqueline du Bief of France won the )Tj
T*(bronze.[55] The German husband and wife pair of Ria and Paul Falk won the mixed )Tj
T*(pairs competition.[56] They defeated Americans Karol and Peter Kennedy, who )Tj
T*(placed second,[57] and Hungarian siblings Marianna and LÃ¡szlÃ³ Nagy, who won the )Tj
T*(bronze medal.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ice hockey )Tj
T*( A majority of the ice hockey matches took place at Jordal Amfi, a new hockey )Tj
T*(stadium built for the Olympics.[59] Nine teams played in the tournament and )Tj
T*(Canada again won the gold medal.[60] Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey )Tj
T*(tournament thus far, but in 1956 the Soviet team began to compete and ended )Tj
T*(Canadian dominance.[61] Canada was represented by the Edmonton Mercurys, an )Tj
T*(amateur hockey team sponsored by the owner of a Mercury automobile )Tj
T*(dealership.[61] Canada played the United States to a three all tie on the final )Tj
T*(day to clinch the Gold, and assure the Americans of Silver. Norwegian newspaper )Tj
T*(Dagbladet criticized the result, calling the game, "fixed in )Tj
T*(advance."[62]Sweden and Czechoslovakia ended up tied for third and played an )Tj
T*(extra game for the bronze medal, which went to Sweden.[60] The Czechs believed )Tj
T*(they had already won the Bronze when they defeated the Swedes on the final day, )Tj
T*(calling the decision to play a tie-breaking game a, "plot of the capalist )Tj
T*(countries."[62] Teams from North America were criticized for their rough play; )Tj
T*(although body checking was legal, it was not often used by European teams, and )Tj
T*(opponents and spectators alike took a dim view of that style of play.[15][60]  )Tj
T*( The IOC lobbied the organizing committee to host either military patrol or )Tj
T*(curling as a demonstration sport.[23] The committee instead selected bandy, )Tj
T*(which had never been included in the Winter Games.[63] Bandy was played by )Tj
T*(teams of eleven on a soccer field-sized rink, using a ball instead of a puck. )Tj
T*(With sticks about 1.2Â m \(3.9Â ft\) long, players attempted to make a goal with )Tj
T*(the ball in the opposing team's net.[64] As a demonstration sport the players )Tj
T*(were ineligible for medals. Three nations participated: Finland, Norway and )Tj
T*(Sweden.[65] Each of the three teams won one game and lost one game; with Sweden )Tj
T*(winning the competition based on number of goals scored, followed by Norway in )Tj
T*(second place, and Finland in third place. Two of the games were played at )Tj
T*(DÃ¦hlenenga Stadion and one at Bislett.[66] )Tj
T*( [edit] Closing ceremonies )Tj
T*( At the 1952 Winter Games the closing ceremonies were a distinct program )Tj
T*(listing, unlike previous Winter Games when the closing ceremonies were held )Tj
T*(directly after the final event. The closing ceremonies were held in Bislett )Tj
T*(Stadion, on Monday evening, 25Â February.[67] The flag bearers entered the )Tj

T*( With a seating capacity of 29,000, the Bislett Stadion became the centrepiece )Tj
T*(of the Games. It was the venue for the speed skating events and the figure )Tj
T*(skating competition. Bislett was large enough for a 400Â m \(1,300Â ft\) speed )Tj
T*(skating track, and a figure skating ice-rink of 30 by 60 m \(98 by 200 ft\); a )Tj
T*(snow bank separated the track and the rink.[73] Because Bislett was an outdoor )Tj
T*(arena, the organizing committee chose Tryvann Stadion and Hamar Stadion as )Tj
T*(secondary alternative skating venues to be used the case of bad weather.[74] In )Tj
T*(1994 Hamar became the venue for the speed skating events at the 1994 Winter )Tj
T*(Olympics in Lillehammer.[1] )Tj
T*( The Oslo Winter Games were the first to feature an Olympic ice hockey )Tj
T*(tournament held on artificial ice.[14] A new stadium was built for the hockey )Tj
T*(tournament in a residential area of eastern Oslo, called Jordal Amfi, which )Tj
T*(accommodated 10,000 spectators in stands rising steeply from the rink.[75] )Tj
T*(Twenty-three of the 36 hockey matches were played at Jordal Amfi, with the )Tj
T*(remaining matches played at Kadettangen, DÃ¦lenenga idrettspark, LillestrÃ¸m )Tj
T*(Stadion and Marienlyst Stadion.[74] )Tj
T*( The cross-country races and ski-jump competition were held at )Tj
T*(Holmenkollbakken, located roughly 8Â km \(5Â mi\) from the center of Oslo.[76] The )Tj
T*(expected number of spectators caused concerns about traffic, so a new road was )Tj
T*(constructed and the existing thoroughfare widened.[77] Holmenkollbakken was )Tj
T*(built in 1892 and improvements were needed to meet international standards. The )Tj
T*(original wood ski-jump was replaced with a concrete tower and jump that was 87Â )Tj
T*(m \(285Â ft\) long.[76] New stands were built to seat 13,000 people, and an area )Tj
T*(was added at the base of the hill to accommodate 130,000 spectators.[78] )Tj
T*( The hills and terrain in the surrounding area met the competitive demands for )Tj
T*(an elite cross-country ski event. A notice board was posted at the start and )Tj
T*(finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors.[79] )Tj
T*(The cross-country and nordic combined races began and ended at the base of the )Tj
T*(ski jump hill. The stands for the ski jump competition had to be removed during )Tj

T*( Tenebrae \(also known as Tenebre\) is a 1982 Italian horror thriller film )Tj
T*(written and directed by Dario Argento. The film stars Anthony Franciosa, John )Tj
T*(Saxon and Daria Nicolodi. After having experimented with two exercises in pure )Tj
T*(supernatural horror, 1977's Suspiria and 1980's Inferno, Tenebrae represented )Tj
T*(Argento's return to the giallo subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the )Tj
T*(1970s. The story concerns an American writer promoting his latest )Tj
T*(murder-mystery novel in Rome, only to get embroiled in the search for a serial )Tj
T*(killer who has apparently been inspired to kill by the novel. )Tj
T*( The film was released in Italy and throughout most of Europe without )Tj
T*(experiencing any reported censorship problems, but was classified, prosecuted )Tj
T*(and banned as a "video nasty" in the United Kingdom. Its theatrical )Tj
T*(distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984, when it was released )Tj
T*(in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane. In its cut form, Tenebrae )Tj
T*(received a mostly negative critical reception, but the original, fully restored )Tj
T*(version later became widely available for reappraisal. It has been described by )Tj
T*(Maitland McDonagh as "the finest film that Argento has ever made."[1] )Tj
T*( Peter Neal \(Franciosa\) is an American writer of violent horror novels whose )Tj
T*(books are tremendously popular in Europe. In Italy to promote his latest work, )Tj
T*(entitled Tenebrae, he is accompanied by his literary agent Bullmer \(Saxon\) and )Tj
T*(his adoring assistant Anne \(Nicolodi\). He is unaware that he is also being )Tj
T*(followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane \(Veronica Lario\). Immediately prior to )Tj
T*(Neal's arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter \(Ania Pieroni\) is brutally )Tj
T*(razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter )Tj
T*(informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal )Tj
T*(is soon contacted by the police, who put Detective Giermani \(Giuliano Gemma\) in )Tj
T*(charge of the investigation, along with the detectiveâ€™s female partner )Tj

T*( More killings occur. Tilde \(Mirella D'Angelo\), a beautiful lesbian journalist, )Tj
T*(is murdered at her home along with her lover. Later, Maria \(Lara Wendel\), the )Tj
T*(young daughter of Neal's landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an axe )Tj
T*(after stumbling into the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer )Tj
T*(Christiano Berti \(John Steiner\) appears to have an unusually intense interest )Tj
T*(in the novelist's work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni )Tj
T*(\(Christiano Borromeo\) watch Berti's house for suspicious activity. Gianni )Tj
T*(decides to separate from Neal in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni )Tj
T*(watches in horror as an axe-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. )Tj
T*(But he is unable to see the murderer's face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on )Tj
T*(the lawn, having been knocked out from behind. )Tj
T*( Giermani's investigation reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with )Tj
T*(Neal's novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will )Tj
T*(cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death )Tj
T*(while waiting for his lover in a public square. Gianni is haunted by the )Tj
T*(thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti's )Tj
T*(house during the night of the interviewer's murder. He returns to the house and )Tj
T*(suddenly remembers what was so importantâ€” he had heard Berti confessing to his )Tj
T*(attacker, "I killed them all, I killed them all!" Before Gianni can share this )Tj
T*(important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and )Tj
T*(strangled to death. )Tj
T*( Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an axe leaps through her )Tj
T*(window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the )Tj
T*(kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her )Tj
T*(until she is dead. Neal is her murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's )Tj
T*(sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory )Tj
T*(involving Neal's murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated him when he was a )Tj
T*(youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed )Tj
T*(his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane, and )Tj
T*(it was he who also killed Berti, Bullmer and Gianni. )Tj
T*( When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane's death, )Tj
T*(Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring )Tj
T*(rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he slits his throat in front of )Tj
T*(them. Finding the telephone out of order, Giermani and Anne go outside to )Tj
T*(report the incident from his car radio. Giermani returns to the house and is )Tj
T*(suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for )Tj
T*(Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a )Tj
T*(metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer. The horror-stricken )Tj
T*(Anne stands in the rain and screams over and over again. )Tj
T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( Dario Argento has claimed that Tenebrae was influenced by a disturbing )Tj
T*(incident he had in 1980 with an obsessed fan. According to Argento, the fan )Tj
T*(telephoned him repeatedly, day after day, until finally confessing that he )Tj
T*(wanted to kill the director. Although ultimately no violence of any kind came )Tj
T*(of the threat, Argento has said he found the experience understandably )Tj
T*(terrifying and was inspired to write Tenebrae as a result of his fears.[1] )Tj
T*( Although tenebrae/tenebre is a Latin/Italian word meaning "darkness" or )Tj
T*("shadows",[2] Argento instructed his cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to film the )Tj
T*(movie with as much bright light as possible. Shot on location in Rome, much of )Tj
T*(the film takes place during daytime, or in harshly overlit interiors. Except )Tj
T*(for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold )Tj
T*(light permeating the surroundings. Argento's stated rationale for this approach )Tj
T*(was an attempt to approximate the allegedly "realistic manner of lighting" used )Tj
T*(in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting "...a )Tj
T*(modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German )Tj
T*(Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent )Tj
T*(flashes...Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, )Tj
T*(reassuring."[3] He also admitted that the lighting and camerawork used in )Tj
T*(Andrzej Å»uÅ‚awski's Possession \(1981\) greatly influenced his decision to have )Tj
T*(Tovoli shoot Tenebrae with such stark lighting. )Tj

T*(to complete.[4] Patrick McAllister, writing as 'Ironwolfe' on Gerry Carpenter's )Tj
T*(Scifilm website described it as )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(one of the most memorable moments in cinema: the crane tracking shot outside )Tj
T*(the downstairs and upstairs apartments of two people. The shot begins outside )Tj
T*(the lower apartment window, moves up to the second floor window, up and over )Tj
T*(the roof of the building, down the other side and to a window on the opposite )Tj
T*(side of the building. The shot lasts two and a half minutes without a pause, )Tj
T*(jerk or cut. If I was to be stuck on a desert island, I'd want Tenebre just so )Tj
T*(I could watch this single shot. \(Amusingly enoughâ€”-or horrifyingly enough, )Tj
T*(depending on your point of viewâ€”-his distributor begged Argento to cut the shot )Tj
T*(down because it was "meaningless"\). The shot stands out even more with the fact )Tj
T*(that the Luma [sic] camera used was new to the industry at the time, and was )Tj
T*(bulky and not as easy to use as it is now. The 2.5 minute sequence took three )Tj
T*(days to shoot.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Although an Italian production, the film was shot with most of the cast )Tj
T*(members speaking their dialogue in English in order to increase its chances for )Tj
T*(successful exportation to the United States. For domestic consumption, the film )Tj
T*(was dubbed into Italian.[6] In the Italian language version, the killer's voice )Tj
T*(heard reading aloud from Neal's book in the opening sequence was supplied by )Tj
T*(Argento himself. In the English language version, Franciosa, Gemma, Saxon and )Tj
T*(Steiner all provided their own voices, while Nicolodi's voice was reportedly )Tj
T*(dubbed by actress Theresa Russell.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Response )Tj
T*( Tenebrae had a wide theatrical release throughout Italy and Europe, something )Tj
T*(the director very much needed after having suffered major distribution problems )Tj
T*(with his previous film, Inferno. In the United States, however, the film fared )Tj
T*(far less well. It remained unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment )Tj
T*(briefly released a heavily edited version under the title Unsane. It was )Tj
T*(approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release version and was )Tj
T*(missing nearly all of the film's violence, which effectively rendered the )Tj
T*(numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that )Tj
T*(established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the )Tj
T*(film's narrative difficult to follow. Predictably, this version of Tenebrae )Tj
T*(received nearly unanimously negative reviews.[8] )Tj
T*( In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of "sexualized )Tj
T*(violence" by the British Board of Film Classification prior to its theatrical )Tj
T*(release.[9][10] It later became one of the thirty-nine so-called "Video )Tj
T*(Nasties" that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK video )Tj
T*(stores under the Video Recordings Act 1984. This ban lasted until 1999, when )Tj
T*(Tenebrae was legally rereleased on videotape, with an additional one second of )Tj
T*(footage removed from the film \(this version was also missing the previously )Tj
T*(censored five seconds\). In 2003, the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it )Tj
T*(without any cuts.[11] )Tj
T*( The film has since been released basically uncut minus approximately 20 )Tj
T*(seconds of extraneous material[12] on DVD in the US, allowing the film to be )Tj
T*(properly evaluated for the first time. )Tj
T*( Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine said that "Tenebre is a riveting defense of )Tj
T*(auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. )Tj
T*(It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare."[13] Keith )Tj
T*(Phipps, of The Onion's A.V. Club, noted "...Argento makes some points about the )Tj
T*(intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning )Tj
T*(trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the )Tj
T*(real reason to watch."[14] Almar Haflidason, in a review for BBC.co.uk, opined, )Tj

T*("Sadistically beautiful and viciously exciting, welcome to true terror with )Tj
T*(Dario Argento's shockingly relentless Tenebrae."[15]Tim Lucas in Video Watchdog )Tj
T*(said, "Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma )Tj
T*(thriller, Tenebrae contains more likeable characters, believable relationships, )Tj
T*(and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento )Tj
T*(film."[16] Justin Felix of DVD Talk said, "Tenebre is an effective murder )Tj
T*(mystery with a number of visual and audio flourishes that exemplify why Dario )Tj
T*(Argento is well-admired in cult circles."[17] Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict )Tj
T*(wrote, "Tenebre is a straight-up giallo in the old-school tradition. It may )Tj
T*(have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. )Tj
T*(We've got all the usual suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots )Tj
T*(of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately )Tj
T*(seventy-two twists before all is revealed... For fans of Argento's earlier )Tj
T*(giallo, this is a must-see."[18]AllMovie called the film "one of Dario )Tj
T*(Argento's best thrillers".[19] )Tj
T*( Not all of the recent critical reaction to Tenebrae has been positive. Gary )Tj
T*(Johnson, editor of Images, complained that "Not much of Tenebre makes much )Tj
T*(sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the )Tj
T*(murder sequences. And these are some of the bloodiest murders of Argento's )Tj
T*(career."[20] In 2004, Tim Lucas reevaluated the film and found that some of his )Tj
T*(earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, "Tenebre is beginning )Tj
T*(to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's )Tj
T*(cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence \(the first two murders )Tj
T*(in particular look stilted\), the many bewildering lapses in logic...and the )Tj
T*(overdone performances of many of its female actors..."[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Themes )Tj
T*( Critics have identified various major themes in Tenebrae. In interviews )Tj
T*(conducted during the filmâ€™s production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento )Tj
T*(offered his own views as to the thematic content of the film. As Maitland )Tj
T*(McDonagh noted in Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario )Tj
T*(Argento, "...Argento has never been more articulate and/or analytical than he )Tj
T*(was on the subject of Tenebrae."[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Vision impairment )Tj
T*( Paul Flanagan has observed that Argento's protagonists in his giallo films )Tj
T*(almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind.[22] It is these )Tj
T*(charactersâ€™ chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle \(the )Tj
T*(puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders\) that generally )Tj
T*(provides much of the filmsâ€™ narrative thrust. Most obviously is the blind )Tj
T*(Franco Arno \(Karl Malden\) in The Cat o' Nine Tails \(1971\), who must use his )Tj
T*(heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his )Tj
T*(niece to solve a mystery. In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage \(1970\), Sam )Tj
T*(Dalmas \(Tony Musante\) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that )Tj
T*(something seems to be "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he )Tj
T*(didn't "miss" anything at all, he simply misinterpreted what happened in front )Tj
T*(of his eyes. In Deep Red \(1975\), Marcus \(David Hemmings\) has a similar problem )Tj
T*(in both seeing and not seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime, and )Tj
T*(doesn't realize his mistake until it's almost too late. \(In discussing this )Tj
T*(recurring theme, Douglas E. Winter noted that Argento creates "a world of )Tj
T*(danger and deception, where seeing is not believing..."[23]\) )Tj
T*( Flanagan observes that in Tenebrae, Argento offers two separate characters who )Tj
T*(suffer from impaired vision. Gianni \(Christian Borromeo\) is an eyewitness to an )Tj
T*(axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a )Tj
T*(vital clue. Returning to the scene of the crime, he suddenly remembers )Tj
T*(everything, and is promptly murdered before being able to tell a soul. Homicide )Tj
T*(detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha )Tj
T*(Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has )Tj
T*(never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is )Tj
T*(similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at )Tj
T*(his feetâ€”he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is. )Tj

T*(killer himself, emphatically introduces the theme of impaired vision when he )Tj
T*(admits to Giermani: "I've tried to figure it out, but I just have this hunch )Tj
T*(that something is missing, a tiny piece of the jigsaw. Somebody who should be )Tj
T*(dead is alive, or somebody who should be alive is already dead." Of course, )Tj
T*(Neal himself is the "missing piece", and in the end he will fake his suicide )Tj
T*(and become the "somebody who should be dead." )Tj
T*( [edit] "Aberrant" sexuality )Tj
T*( In his study of the film, Flanagan argues that in Tenebrae, "male and female )Tj
T*(sexual deviancy are the central issues," noting that Berti targets those he )Tj
T*(considers to be "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually )Tj
T*(promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her )Tj
T*(bisexual lover. He kills the comparatively "normal" Maria only because she )Tj
T*(inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. )Tj
T*( McDonagh notes that Tenebrae expands a theme already introduced in Argento's )Tj
T*(earlier giallo films. "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine )Tj
T*(Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet \(1972\), and Deep Red are full of sex, of )Tj
T*(course: transvestitism and sexual role playing are in all four films central )Tj
T*(factors and none lacks for imagery dealing in diverse sexual behavior. But )Tj
T*(Tenebrae's overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other gialli." She )Tj
T*(says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it "the first of )Tj
T*(Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect," and further notes that )Tj
T*("Tenebrae is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in )Tj
T*(nature."[1] )Tj
T*( Flanagan and McDonagh â€“ and, indeed, most critics â€“ have noted that two )Tj
T*(sexually-charged flashbacks are key to understanding Tenebrae. These distinct )Tj
T*(but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the )Tj
T*(course of the film, usually immediately following a murder sequence. Although )Tj
T*(these flashbacks are never fully explained, the first of these memories reveals )Tj
T*(a beautiful young woman's sexual humiliation \(basically, an oral rape\) of a )Tj
T*(teenaged boy \(presumably Peter Neal\) on a pale-white beach, followed \(in the )Tj
T*(second flashback\) by the vicious revenge-murder of the woman some time later. )Tj
T*(The young woman \(played by transgender actress Eva Robin's\) is mostly topless )Tj
T*(during this first sequence, and she humiliates the young man by jamming the )Tj
T*(heel of one of her Freudian shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held )Tj
T*(down by a group of gleeful boys. McDonagh notes that all of the fetishistic )Tj
T*(imagery of these flashbacks, combined with the sadistic details of the murder )Tj
T*(sequences in the main narrative, "set the parameters of Tenebrae's fetishistic )Tj
T*(and fetishicized visual vocabulary, couched in terms both ritualistic and )Tj
T*(orgiastically out of control...Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and )Tj
T*(Tenebrae revels in them, inviting the spectator to join in; in fact, it dares )Tj
T*(the viewer not to do so."[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dark doubles )Tj
T*( In his review of Tenebrae, Kevin Lyon observes, "The plot revolves around the )Tj
T*(audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer )Tj
T*(\(about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento\) to the eminently )Tj
T*(likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke."[24] While also noticing this )Tj
T*(device as being "striking", McDonagh notes that this guilt )Tj
T*(transmission/transfer occurs between two dark doubles, two seriously warped )Tj
T*(individuals. She suggests that "Neal and Berti...act as mirrors to one another, )Tj
T*(each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other."[1] Berti's )Tj
T*(obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the )Tj
T*(writer, while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of )Tj
T*(some kind of "elaborate fiction." When the bloody Neal is confronted by )Tj
T*(Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, )Tj
T*("It was like a book...a book!" )Tj
T*( McDonagh notes that Argento also emphasizes a similar doubling between Neal )Tj
T*(and Giermani. "Giermani...is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his )Tj
T*(role as investigator...the detective/writer and the writer/detective each )Tj
T*(belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection )Tj
T*(could be made to go away." McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the )Tj

T*(film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani "go )Tj
T*(away", virtually replacing him on screen "in a shot that is as schematically )Tj
T*(logical as it is logically outrageous."[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] An imaginary city )Tj
T*( In an interview that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film )Tj
T*(was intended as near-science fiction, taking place "about five or more years in )Tj
T*(the future...Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the )Tj
T*(result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has )Tj
T*(happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember...It )Tj
T*(isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the )Tj
T*(world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will )Tj
T*(become very apparent."[25] Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed )Tj
T*(that this vaguely science-fictional concept "isn't apparent at all"[1] and, in )Tj
T*(fact, no critics noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the )Tj
T*(theatrical release of the film. )Tj
T*( While rejecting this thematic concern as unrealized by Argento, McDonagh )Tj
T*(noticed that the result of the director's experiment is a strange )Tj
T*("architectural landscape" that becomes the "key element in differentiating )Tj
T*(Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." Argento's use of unusual architectural )Tj
T*(space and so-called visual "hyper-realism" results in an enormously fake )Tj
T*(looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, "...I )Tj
T*(dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes )Tj
T*(that the film's "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'...Its imaginary )Tj
T*(geography is pieced together out of fragments of 'Rome'...that emphasize vast )Tj
T*(unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban )Tj
T*(American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and )Tj
T*(parking garages."[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Influences )Tj
T*( Bill Warren has observed that Tenebrae "is in most ways a typical giallo: )Tj
T*(visually extremely stylish, with imaginative, sometimes stunning )Tj
T*(cinematography...mysterious, gruesome murders, often in picturesque locations; )Tj
T*(at the end, the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to )Tj
T*(terrify and surprise."[26] Those narrative and stylistic clichÃ©s had been )Tj
T*(introduced years before Argento had ever made his first thriller \(most critics )Tj
T*(point to Mario Bava's The Girl Who Knew Too Much \(1963\) as the original )Tj
T*(giallo[27]\). By the time he made Tenebrae, Argento had become the acknowledged )Tj
T*(master of the sub-genre, to the point where he felt confident enough to be )Tj
T*(openly self-referential to his own past. Tim Lucas notes that Argento )Tj
T*(explicitly "quotes some of his earlier films with affection: the reckless )Tj
T*(driving humor from The Cat o' Nine Tails, the image of horror revealed behind )Tj
T*(the hero as he bends down from The Bird with the Crystal Plumage."[16]Bird's )Tj
T*(climactic "murderous use of a large and unusual sculpture",[28] in which Tony )Tj
T*(Musante is trapped beneath a huge work of art with long spikes, is also )Tj
T*(recycled/referenced in the final moments of Tenebrae. )Tj
T*( McDonagh argues that Argentoâ€™s influences for Tenebrae were far broader than )Tj
T*(just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She notes that the film's )Tj
T*("surprisingly strong narrative" is suggestive of "the most paranoid excesses of )Tj
T*(film noir." McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt )Tj
T*(\(1956\) \("in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence...is in fact )Tj
T*(guilty of the murder"\) and Roy William Neill's Black Angel \(1946\) \("in which a )Tj
T*(man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he )Tj
T*(himself is the killer"\) both use such a similar plot twist to Tenebrae that )Tj
T*(Argento may very well have used them as partial models for his story. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Coming at the tail end of the giallo cycle, Tenebrae does not appear to have )Tj
T*(been as influential as Argento's earlier films were on subsequent thrillers. )Tj
T*(However, many of the characters, scenes and plot turns in Lamberto Bava's A )Tj
T*(Blade in the Dark \(1983\) were arguably directly inspired by Argento's film.[29] )Tj
T*( Douglas E. Winter has opined that Tenebrae's Louma crane sequence was )Tj
T*(stylistically influential and was specifically "replicated in Brian De Palma's )Tj

T*(John Lithgow standing behind a victim is often discussed as being an )Tj
T*(unacknowledged "steal" from Tenebrae.[30][31][32]Robert Zemeckis's What Lies )Tj
T*(Beneath \(2000\) also contains a very similar moment, although Zemeckis has )Tj
T*(denied having any familiarity at all with Italian thrillers.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Soundtrack )Tj
T*( Argento had used the Italian rock band Goblin to provide the musical scores to )Tj
T*(two of his previous films, Deep Red \(1975\) and Suspiria \(1977\). The group had )Tj
T*(disbanded in 1980, but three of the band's membersâ€”Claudio Simonetti \(Roland )Tj
T*(Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus, Minimoog, Piano, Electric piano, Oberheim DMX )Tj
T*(Digital Drum, Roland TR-808, Roland MC4 Computer\), Fabio Pignatelli \(Fender )Tj
T*(bass normal and fretless\), and Massimo Morante \(electric and acoustic )Tj
T*(guitar\)â€”reunited at Argento's request to work on Tenebrae. The resulting )Tj
T*(synth-driven score was credited to "Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante". )Tj
T*( While not as well regarded as Goblin's earlier scores for Deep Red, Suspiria, )Tj
T*(or Dawn of the Dead \(1978\), Tim Lucas felt the soundtrack is "...so fused to )Tj
T*(the fabric of the picture that Tenebrae might be termed...a giallo musicale; )Tj
T*(that is, a giallo in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to )Tj
T*(occupy the same plane as the action and characters."[21] )Tj
T*( The Tenebrae soundtrack album has been enduringly popular enough to have had )Tj
T*(multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on )Tj
T*(the Italian Cinevox label. That version consisted of only eight tracks. In )Tj
T*(1997, Cinevox issued a greatly expanded version on CD, including eleven bonus )Tj
T*(tracks, with a running time of over an hour. In 2004, the expanded CD was )Tj
T*(released in the U.S. on the Armadillo Music label. In 2012 it was released )Tj
T*(again on Vinyl by AMS Records \(italy\). )Tj
T*( Some European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby )Tj
T*(card sets, advertised the film as Tenebre, and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release )Tj
T*(uses that same title. However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, )Tj
T*(the title is clearly Tenebrae. In addition, the title of Neal's latest book in )Tj
T*(the film is shown in closeup as being Tenebrae. In a lengthy interview with )Tj
T*(Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of Fangoria in )Tj
T*(1983 and 1984, the title was always referred to as "Tenebrae".[34][35] )Tj
T*( On the DVD review website The Digital Fix, Michael Mackenzie argues that the )Tj
T*(film's actual title is Tenebre, since it is that title that was "used for the )Tj
T*(Italian prints and the cover of the US DVD."[36] But DVD Talk reviewer Justin )Tj
T*(Felix noted in his review of the DVD release that, "in its package art, Anchor )Tj

T*(    )Tj
T*( Prosperity theology \(sometimes referred to as the prosperity gospel or the )Tj
T*(health and wealth gospel\)[A] is a Christian religious doctrine that financial )Tj
T*(blessing is the will of God for Christians, and that faith, positive speech, )Tj
T*(and donations to Christian ministries will always increase one's material )Tj
T*(wealth. Based on non-traditional interpretations of the Bible, often with )Tj
T*(emphasis on the Book of Malachi, the doctrine views the Bible as a contract )Tj
T*(between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver his )Tj
T*(promises of security and prosperity. Confessing these promises to be true is )Tj
T*(perceived as an act of faith, which God will honor. )Tj
T*( Proponents teach that the doctrine is an aspect of the path to Christian )Tj
T*(dominion over society, arguing that God's promise of dominion to Israel applies )Tj
T*(to Christians today. The doctrine emphasizes the importance of personal )Tj
T*(empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. The )Tj
T*(atonement \(reconciliation with God\) is interpreted to include the alleviation )Tj
T*(of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This )Tj
T*(is believed to be achieved through visualization and positive confession, and )Tj
T*(is often taught in mechanical and contractual terms. )Tj
T*( It was during the Healing Revivals of the 1950s that prosperity theology first )Tj
T*(came to prominence in the United States, although commentators have linked the )Tj
T*(origins of its theology to the New Thought movement. The prosperity teaching )Tj
T*(later figured prominently in the Word of Faith movement and 1980s )Tj
T*(televangelism. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was adopted by influential leaders in )Tj
T*(the Charismatic Movement and promoted by Christian missionaries throughout the )Tj
T*(world, sometimes leading to the establishment of mega-churches. Prominent )Tj
T*(leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E. W. Kenyon, Oral )Tj
T*(Roberts, A. A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T. L. Osborn, and Kenneth Hagin. )Tj
T*( Churches in which the prosperity gospel is taught are often non-denominational )Tj
T*(and usually directed by a sole pastor or leader, although some have developed )Tj
T*(multi-church networks that bear similarities to denominations. Such churches )Tj
T*(typically set aside extended time to teach about giving and request donations )Tj
T*(from the congregation, encouraging positive speech and faith. Prosperity )Tj
T*(churches often teach about financial responsibility, though some journalists )Tj
T*(and academics have criticized their advice in this area as misleading. )Tj
T*(Prosperity theology has been criticized by leaders in the Pentecostal and )Tj
T*(Charismatic movements, as well as other Christian denominations. These leaders )Tj
T*(maintain that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to )Tj
T*(scripture. Some critics have proposed that prosperity theology cultivates )Tj
T*(authoritarian organizations, with the leaders controlling the lives of the )Tj
T*(adherents. The doctrine has also become popular in South Korea; academics have )Tj
T*(attributed some of its success to its parallels with the traditional )Tj
T*(shamanistic culture. Prosperity theology has drawn followers from the American )Tj
T*(middle class and poor, and has been likened to the cargo cult phenomenon, )Tj
T*(traditional African religion, and black liberation theology. )Tj

T*(this is interpreted as physical health and economic prosperity. Teachers of the )Tj
T*(doctrine focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit )Tj
T*(and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation )Tj
T*(because they are made in the image of God and teach that positive confession )Tj
T*(allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects )Tj
T*(around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the )Tj
T*(alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness )Tj
T*(are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There )Tj
T*(are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed )Tj
T*(paradigm of prosperity.Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, )Tj
T*(supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human )Tj
T*(being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.[6][B] )Tj
T*( Wealth is interpreted in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, obtained )Tj
T*(through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. )Tj
T*(This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms;Kenneth Copeland, an )Tj
T*(American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity is governed by laws, )Tj
T*(while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van )Tj
T*(Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's )Tj
T*(teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and )Tj
T*(humanity.[6] )Tj
T*( The prosperity theology teaching of positive confession stems from its )Tj
T*(proponents' view of scripture. The Bible is seen as a faith contract between )Tj
T*(God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must )Tj
T*(fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a )Tj
T*(belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever )Tj
T*(they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that )Tj
T*(the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means )Tj
T*(that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. )Tj
T*(Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; )Tj
T*(faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality. )Tj
T*( The teaching is often based on non-traditional interpretations of Bible )Tj
T*(verses, the Book of Malachi often being given special attention. While Malachi )Tj
T*(has generally been celebrated by Christians for its passages about the messiah, )Tj
T*(teachers of prosperity theology usually draw attention to its descriptions of )Tj
T*(physical wealth. Frequently quoted verses include: )Tj
T*( Malachi 3:10: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be )Tj
T*(meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I )Tj
T*(will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that )Tj
T*(there shall not be room enough to receive it" \(KJV\).[6])Tj
T*(Matthew 25:14â€“30: the Parable of the talents[11])Tj
T*(John 10:10: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it )Tj
T*(more abundantly" \(KJV\).[6])Tj
T*(Philippians 4:19: "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in )Tj
T*(glory by Christ Jesus" \(KJV\).)Tj
T*(3Â John 2: "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in )Tj
T*(health, even as thy soul prospereth" \(KJV\).)Tj
T*( [edit] Practices )Tj
T*( Prosperity churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving. )Tj
T*(Services commonly include two sermons, one of which focuses on giving and )Tj
T*(prosperity, including Biblical references to tithing; a second sermon on )Tj
T*(another topic follows the offering. Prosperity church leaders often bestow a )Tj
T*(specific blessing on the money being donated, some have even been reported to )Tj
T*(instruct worshipers to hold their donations above their heads during the )Tj
T*(prayer. )Tj
T*( Congregants in prosperity churches are encouraged to speak positive statements )Tj
T*(about aspects of their lives that they wish to see improved. These statements, )Tj
T*(known as positive confessions, are said to miraculously change aspects of )Tj
T*(people's lives if spoken with faith. Prosperity churches also encourage people )Tj
T*(to "live without limits" and cultivate optimism about their lives.T. D. Jakes, )Tj

T*( While prosperity churches have a reputation for manipulating and alienating )Tj

T*(from a "welfare" or "victim" mentality. Many prosperity churches hold seminars )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Postwar Healing Revivals )Tj
T*( Leaders of the Pentecostal Movement in the early 20th century did not embrace )Tj
T*(prosperity theology. A recognizable form of the doctrine began to take shape )Tj
T*(within the movement during the 1940s and 1950s, through the teachings of )Tj
T*(Pentecostal deliverance and healing evangelists. Combining prosperity teaching )Tj
T*(with revivalism and faith healing, these evangelists taught "the laws of faith )Tj
T*(\('ask and ye shall receive'\) and the laws of divine reciprocity \('give and it )Tj
T*(will be given back unto you'\)". )Tj
T*( One prominent early figure in prosperity theology was E. W. Kenyon, educated )Tj
T*(in the 1890s at Emerson College of Oratory, where he was exposed to the New )Tj
T*(Thought movement. Kenyon later became connected with well-known Pentecostal )Tj
T*(leaders and wrote about supernatural revelation and positive declarations. His )Tj
T*(writing influenced leaders of the nascent prosperity movement during the )Tj
T*(post-war American healing revival. )Tj
T*( Oral Roberts began teaching prosperity theology in 1947. He explained the laws )Tj
T*(of faith as a "blessing pact" in which God would return donations "seven fold", )Tj
T*(promising that donors would receive back from unexpected sources the money they )Tj
T*(donated to him. Roberts offered to return any donation that did not lead to an )Tj
T*(equivalent unexpected payment. In the 1970s, Roberts characterized his blessing )Tj
T*(pact teaching as the "seed faith" doctrine: donations were a form of "seed" )Tj
T*(which would grow in value and be returned to the donor. Roberts began )Tj
T*(recruiting "partners", wealthy donors who received exclusive conference )Tj
T*(invitations and ministry access in exchange for support. )Tj
T*( In 1953, faith healer A. A. Allen published The Secret to Scriptural Financial )Tj
T*(Success and promoted merchandise such as "miracle tent shavings" and prayer )Tj
T*(cloths anointed with "miracle oil". In the late 1950s, Allen increasingly )Tj
T*(focused on prosperity. He taught that faith could miraculously solve financial )Tj
T*(problems and claimed to have had a miraculous experience in which God )Tj
T*(supernaturally changed one-dollar bills into twenty-dollar bills to allow him )Tj
T*(to pay his debts. Allen taught the "word of faith" or the power to speak )Tj
T*(something into being. )Tj
T*( In the 1960s, prosperity became a primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. )Tj
T*(Osborn began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became known for his often )Tj
T*(ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and )Tj
T*(William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their )Tj
T*(fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted )Tj
T*(in part by the expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign )Tj
T*(schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God )Tj
T*(denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent )Tj
T*(healing evangelists. )Tj
T*( [edit] Televangelism )Tj
T*( During the 1960s, prosperity gospel teachers embraced televangelism and came )Tj
T*(to dominate religious programming in the United States. Oral Roberts led the )Tj

T*( [edit] Word of Faith )Tj
T*( Main article: Word of Faith )Tj
T*( Although nearly all of the healing evangelists of the 1940s and '50s taught )Tj
T*(that faith could bring financial rewards, a new prosperity-oriented teaching )Tj
T*(developed in the 1970s that differed from the one taught by Pentecostal )Tj
T*(evangelists of the 1950s. This "Positive Confession" or "Word of Faith" )Tj
T*(movement taught that a Christian with faith can speak into existence anything )Tj
T*(consistent with the will of God. )Tj
T*( Kenneth Hagin was credited with a key role in the expansion of prosperity )Tj
T*(theology. He founded the RHEMA Bible Training Center in 1974, and over the next )Tj
T*(20 years, the school trained more than 10,000 students in his theology. As is )Tj
T*(true of other prosperity movements, there is no theological governing body for )Tj
T*(the Word of Faith movement, and well-known ministries differ on some )Tj
T*(theological issues. The teachings of Kenneth Hagin have been described by Candy )Tj
T*(Gunther Brown of Indiana University as the most "orthodox" form of Word of )Tj
T*(Faith prosperity teaching. )Tj
T*( [edit] Recent U.S. history )Tj
T*( The Neo-Pentecostal movement has been characterized in part by an emphasis on )Tj
T*(prosperity theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic )Tj
T*(Christianity during the late 1990s. By 2006, three of the four largest )Tj
T*(congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology, and Joel )Tj
T*(Osteen has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and )Tj
T*(Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million )Tj
T*(copies.[6][D]Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez also sold millions of copies )Tj
T*(and invited readers to seek prosperity. )Tj
T*( By the 2000s, adherents of prosperity theology in the United States were most )Tj
T*(common in the Sun Belt.[11] In the late 2000s, proponents claimed that tens of )Tj
T*(millions of Christians had accepted prosperity theology.[11] A 2006 poll by )Tj
T*(Time reported that 17 percent of Christians in America said they identified )Tj
T*(with the movement.[6] There is no official governing body for the movement, )Tj
T*(though many ministries are unofficially linked. )Tj
T*( In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened a probe into the finances of six )Tj
T*(televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland )Tj
T*(Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long )Tj
T*(Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January )Tj
T*(2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating that he believed )Tj
T*(self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government )Tj
T*(action.[37][E] Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated fully with )Tj
T*(Grassley's investigation.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] International growth )Tj
T*( In the 2000s, churches teaching prosperity theology saw significant growth in )Tj
T*(the Third World. According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University, )Tj
T*(poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing )Tj
T*(because of their economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on )Tj
T*(miracles. One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa, particularly )Tj
T*(Nigeria. In the Philippines, the El Shaddai movement, part of the Catholic )Tj
T*(Charismatic Renewal, has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant )Tj
T*(Christianity. One South Korean prosperity church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, )Tj

T*( Most churches in the prosperity movement are non-denominational and )Tj
T*(independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches )Tj
T*(typically reject Presbyterian polity \(or governance\) and the idea that a pastor )Tj
T*(should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity )Tj
T*(churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including )Tj
T*(Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate )Tj
T*(authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the )Tj
T*(lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends )Tj
T*(that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of )Tj
T*(pastors. )Tj
T*( In the United States, the movement has drawn many followers from the middle )Tj
T*(class and is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas.[11] In Exporting )Tj
T*(the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul )Tj
T*(Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing )Tj
T*(disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s.[G] )Tj
T*(Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, )Tj
T*(particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the )Tj
T*(University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny,[11] )Tj
T*(the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin )Tj
T*(Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of )Tj
T*(the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill )Tj
T*(the American Dream by using supernatural power. )Tj
T*( Prosperity theology has become popular among poor Americans, particularly )Tj
T*(those who seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth )Tj
T*(in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among )Tj
T*(immigrants.[11] Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue )Tj
T*(that it encompasses a variety of views.[6] Joel Robbins of the University of )Tj
T*(Tokyo notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the )Tj
T*(poorâ€”especially in the Global Southâ€”to the fact that it promises security and )Tj
T*(helps explain capitalism. Anthropologist Simon Coleman developed a theory based )Tj
T*(on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. )Tj
T*(In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part )Tj
T*(of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in )Tj
T*(return \(either from God directly or through another church member\).Hillsong )Tj
T*(Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity )Tj
T*(theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this )Tj
T*(message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians. )Tj
T*( In a 1998 interview in Christianity Today, Bong Rin Ro of the Asia Graduate )Tj
T*(School of Theology suggested that the growth in popularity of prosperity )Tj
T*(theology in South Korea reflects a strong "shamanistic influence". Bong pointed )Tj
T*(to parallels between the tradition of paying shamans for healing and the )Tj
T*(prosperity theology's contractual doctrine about giving and blessings. Asia's )Tj
T*(economic problems, he argued, encouraged the growth of the doctrine in South )Tj
T*(Korea, though he claims it ignores the poor and needy. During the interview, he )Tj
T*(stated that he saw the problem beginning to be reversed, citing calls for )Tj
T*(renewed faith and other practices.[47]Cho Yong-gi, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel )Tj
T*(Church in Seoul, has been criticized for shamanising Christianity. This )Tj
T*(criticism has focused on his healing and exorcism ministries and his promise of )Tj
T*(material blessings. Malaysian Christian writer Hwa Yung has defended Cho's )Tj
T*(healing and exorcism ministries, arguing that he successfully contextualized )Tj
T*(the gospel in a culture where shamanism was still prevalent. However, Hwa )Tj
T*(criticizes Cho's teaching of earthly blessings for not reflecting a trust in )Tj
T*(God's daily provision and for their heavy focus on earthly wealth. )Tj
T*( [edit] Comparisons with other movements )Tj
T*( Historian Carter Lindberg of Boston University has drawn parallels between )Tj
T*(contemporary prosperity theology and the medieval indulgence trade. Coleman )Tj

T*(Critics, such as Evangelical pastor Michael Catt, have argued that prosperity )Tj
T*(theology has little in common with traditional Christian theology.[53] )Tj
T*(Prominent evangelical leaders, such as Rick Warren,[6]Ben Witherington III,[6] )Tj
T*(and Jerry Falwell,[54] have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes )Tj
T*(denouncing it as heretical.[6] Warren proposes that prosperity theology )Tj

T*(Hughes notes that some 1st-century rabbis portrayed material blessings as a )Tj

T*(that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible. Church )Tj
T*(leaders are often criticized for abusing the faith of their parishioners by )Tj
T*(enriching themselves through large donations.[56] Prosperity theology has been )Tj
T*(opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles. For )Tj
T*(instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the )Tj
T*(Apostle, who is believed to have experienced significant suffering during his )Tj
T*(ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. )Tj
T*( In their book Health, Wealth and Happiness, theologians David Jones and )Tj
T*(Russell Woodbridge characterize the doctrine as poor theology. They suggest )Tj
T*(that righteousness cannot be earned and that the Bible does not promise an easy )Tj
T*(life. They argue that it is inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus and propose )Tj
T*(that the central message of the gospel should be Jesus' life, death, and )Tj
T*(resurrection. Jones and Woodbridge see Jesus' importance as vital, criticizing )Tj
T*(the prosperity gospel for marginalizing him in favor of a focus on human need. )Tj
T*(In another article, Jones criticizes the prosperity theology interpretation of )Tj
T*(the Abrahamic covenant, God's promise to bless Abraham's descendants, arguing )Tj
T*(that this blessing is spiritual and should already apply to all Christians. He )Tj
T*(also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, )Tj
T*(criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. )Tj
T*(He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life )Tj
T*(and criticizes John Avanzini's teaching that Jesus was wealthy as a )Tj
T*(misrepresentation,[61] noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up )Tj
T*(their material possessions. Although he accepts giving as "praiseworthy",[61] )Tj
T*(he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the "Law of )Tj
T*(Compensation",[61] which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will )Tj
T*(give back more in return. Rather, Jones cites Jesus' teaching to "give, hoping )Tj
T*(for nothing in return."[61] Jones and Woodbridge also note that Jesus )Tj
T*(instructed followers to focus on spiritual rewards, citing his command in )Tj
T*(Matthew 6:19â€“20 "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earthÂ ... But lay up )Tj
T*(for yourselves treasures in heaven" \(KJV\). Jones criticizes the doctrine's view )Tj
T*(of faith: he does not believe that it should be used as a spiritual force for )Tj
T*(material gain but seen as selfless acceptance of God.[61] )Tj

T*(contrasting these examples with the focus on positive confessions taught by )Tj
T*(prosperity theology. The Council argues that the biblical Greek word often )Tj
T*(translated as "confess" literally translates as "to speak the same thing", and )Tj
T*(refers to both positive and negative confessions. The statement also criticizes )Tj
T*(the doctrine for failing to recognize the will of God: God's will should have )Tj
T*(precedence over the will of man, and Christians should "recognize the )Tj
T*(sovereignty of God". The statement further criticizes prosperity theology for )Tj
T*(overlooking the importance of prayer, arguing that prayer should be used for )Tj
T*(all requests, not simply positive confession. The Council noted that Christians )Tj
T*(should expect suffering in this life. They urge readers to apply practical )Tj
T*(tests to positive confession, arguing that the doctrine appeals to those who )Tj
T*(are already in affluent societies but that many Christians in other societies )Tj
T*(are impoverished or imprisoned. Finally, the paper criticizes the distinction )Tj
T*(made by advocates of prosperity theology in the two Greek words that mean )Tj
T*("speaking", arguing that the distinction is false and that they are used )Tj
T*(interchangeably in the Greek text.[F] The Council accused prosperity theology )Tj
T*(of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs, with the result )Tj
T*(that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the holistic message )Tj
T*(of the Bible. )Tj
T*( Prosperity theology, however, casts itself as the reclamation of true doctrine )Tj
T*(and thus part of a path to Christian dominion over secular society. It contends )Tj
T*(that God's promises of prosperity and victory to Israel in the Old Testament )Tj
T*(apply to New-Covenant Christians today, and that faith and holy actions release )Tj
T*(this prosperity.C. Peter Wagner, a leader of the New Apostolic Reformation, has )Tj
T*(argued that if Christians take dominion over aspects of society, the Earth will )Tj
T*(experience "peace and prosperity".[69] Some Latin Americans who have embraced )Tj
T*(prosperity theology argue that Christianity has historically placed an )Tj
T*(unnecessary focus on suffering. They often view this as a Roman Catholic )Tj
T*(doctrine that should be discarded and replaced with an emphasis on prosperity. )Tj
T*(Prosperity theology advocates also argue that biblical promises of blessings )Tj
T*(awaiting the poor have been unnecessarily spiritualized, and should be )Tj
T*(understood literally. )Tj
T*( [edit] Notable works )Tj
T*( Notable works that advocate prosperity theology include:[6] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ^ Pejorative nicknames have been attached to the theology, including "name it )Tj
T*(and claim it" and "blab it and grab it".[73])Tj

T*(Italy, Spain and Portugal \(1835â€“37\) and the two-volume Lives of the Most )Tj
T*(Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France \(1838â€“39\) consist of biographies )Tj
T*(of important writers and thinkers of the 14th to 18th centuries. Most of them )Tj
T*(were written by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Shelley's biographies reveal )Tj
T*(her as a professional woman of letters, contracted to produce several volumes )Tj
T*(of works and paid well to do so. Her extensive knowledge of history and )Tj
T*(languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her )Tj
T*(interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in )Tj
T*(these works. )Tj
T*( At times Shelley had trouble finding sufficient research materials and had to )Tj
T*(make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the )Tj
T*(Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary )Tj
T*(sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most )Tj
T*(obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence )Tj
T*(movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women )Tj
T*(sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing )Tj
T*(that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational )Tj
T*(and social opportunities. )Tj
T*( The Lives did not attract enough critical attention to become a bestseller. A )Tj
T*(fair number were printed and sold, however, and far more copies of the Lives )Tj
T*(circulated than of Shelley's novels. Some of the volumes were pirated in the )Tj
T*(United States, where they were praised by the poet and critic Edgar Allan Poe. )Tj
T*(Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have until recently )Tj
T*(received little academic appreciation. )Tj
T*( [edit] Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia )Tj
T*( During the first quarter of the 19th century, self-improvement literature )Tj
T*(became an important portion of the book market: "it was the age of the 'Family )Tj
T*(Library' edition".[1] In his article on the Cabinet Cyclopaedia, Morse Peckham )Tj
T*(writes that this "revolution in literacy, [was] partly the result of the spread )Tj
T*(of liberal ideas by the French Revolution, [and] partly of the desire to combat )Tj
T*(those ideas by teaching the poor to read the Bible and religious tractsÂ [...Â )Tj
T*(It] was to have an effect on modern society almost as profound as the )Tj
T*(industrial and agricultural revolutions".[2]Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet )Tj
T*(Cyclopaedia, published between 1829 and 1846, was one of the most successful of )Tj
T*(these enterprises, which also included John Murray's Family Library and the )Tj
T*(publications of the Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge.[3] )Tj
T*(Although intended for the "general reader", the series was aimed specifically )Tj
T*(at the middle class rather than the masses: each volume cost six shillings, )Tj
T*(prohibiting purchase by the poor.[4] The advertisements for the Cyclopaedia )Tj
T*(describe the expected audience as "merchants, captains, families, [and] )Tj
T*(new-married couples".[5] The prospectus assured its readers that "nothing will )Tj
T*(be admitted into the pages of the 'CABINET CYCLOPAEDIA' which can have the most )Tj
T*(remote tendency to offend public or private morals. To enforce the cultivation )Tj
T*(of religion and the practice of virtue should be a principal object with all )Tj
T*(who undertake to inform the public mind."[6] )Tj
T*( The series was divided into five "Cabinets": Arts and Manufactures, Biography, )Tj
T*(History, Natural History, and Natural Philosophy. The advertisement claimed )Tj
T*(these covered "all the usual divisions of knowledge that are not of a technical )Tj
T*(and professional kind".[7] Unlike other encyclopedias of the time, Lardner's )Tj
T*(Cabinet Cyclopaedia arranged its articles topically rather than )Tj
T*(alphabetically.[8] The series eventually contained 61 titles in 133 volumes and )Tj
T*(customers could purchase a single volume, a single cabinet, or the entire )Tj
T*(set.[9] The first volume was published in December 1829 by Longman, Reese, )Tj
T*(Orme, Browne, Greene, and John Taylor.[10] Thirty-eight identified authors )Tj
T*(contributed \(others are unidentified\);[11]Mary Shelley was the only female )Tj
T*(contributor and the eighth most productive.[10] )Tj
T*( Reverend Dr. Dionysius Lardner, a science lecturer at University College )Tj
T*(London, started the Cabinet Cyclopaedia in 1827 or 1828.[8] The authors who )Tj
T*(contributed to the volumes spanned the political spectrum and included many )Tj
T*(luminaries of the day. James Mackintosh, Walter Scott, Thomas Moore, and Connop )Tj

T*(Thirlwall wrote histories; Robert Southey wrote naval biographies; Henry Roscoe )Tj
T*(wrote legal biographies; John Herschel wrote on astronomy and the philosophy of )Tj
T*(science; August de Morgan wrote on mathematics; David Brewster wrote on optics; )Tj
T*(and Lardner himself wrote on mathematics and physics.[12] Authors were usually )Tj
T*(paid about Â£200 for each volume, though some contracts were much higher or )Tj
T*(lower. For example, Irish poet Thomas Moore was contracted to write a )Tj
T*(two-volume History of Ireland for Â£1,500.[13] One of the reasons the overall )Tj
T*(project ran into difficulty may have been that it overpaid well-known )Tj
T*(writers.[14] Peckham speculates that the reason many of the famous writers )Tj
T*(listed on the prospectus never participated was because of the project's )Tj
T*(financial problems. The 19 substitute contributors were, he writes, "at the )Tj
T*(time and subsequently a far less distinguished group than Lardner had )Tj
T*(originally announced".[15] )Tj
T*( The books were relatively expensive to print, because of the Corbould and )Tj
T*(Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, and the use of )Tj
T*(Spottiswoode's printing house.[16] In order to cut costs, the publishers )Tj
T*(decided to use small print and narrow margins.[16] An estimated 4,000 copies of )Tj
T*(the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would )Tj
T*(probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835.[16] )Tj
T*(As it became clear that the series was not going to take off, fewer review )Tj
T*(copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller.[16] Lardner's interest )Tj
T*(in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business )Tj
T*(dealings.[16] However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in )Tj
T*(print until 1890.[17] )Tj
T*( Because of the popularity of encyclopedias at the beginning of the 19th )Tj
T*(century, the Cabinet Cyclopaedia did not receive enough critical notice to make )Tj
T*(it a bestseller. Often the reviews were "perfunctory".[16] However, some )Tj
T*(individual writers received attention. Moore, for example, was given a )Tj
T*(front-page spread in the Literary Gazette for his history of Ireland.[18] )Tj
T*(Shelley's volumes received 12 reviews in totalâ€”a good numberâ€”but "her name was )Tj
T*(never fully exploited" in the project; whether by her choice or Lardner's, it )Tj
T*(is unclear.[16] Nevertheless, Peckham writes that "the Cyclopaedia on the whole )Tj
T*(was a distinguished and valuable work", and some of the individual volumes )Tj
T*(became famous.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Mary Shelley's contributions )Tj
T*( Written during the last productive decade of Mary Shelley's career,[21] her )Tj
T*(contributions fill about three-quarters of these five volumes[22] and reveal )Tj
T*(her to be a professional woman of letters.[23] They demonstrate her knowledge )Tj
T*(of several languages and historical research covering several centuries, her )Tj
T*(ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the )Tj
T*(burgeoning field of feminist historiography.[24] She "wrote with many books to )Tj
T*(hand â€“ reading \(or rereading\) some, consulting others, cross-referring, )Tj
T*(interweaving abridged and paraphrased source material with her own )Tj
T*(comment".[25] Shelley combined secondary sources with memoir and anecdote and )Tj
T*(included her own judgments, a biographical style made popular by the )Tj
T*(18th-century critic Samuel Johnson in his Lives of the Poets \(1779â€“81\).[26] She )Tj
T*(describes this technique in her "Life of Metastasio": )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(It is from passages such as these, interspersed in his letters, that we can )Tj
T*(collect the peculiar character of the man â€“ his difference from others â€“ and )Tj
T*(the mechanism of being that rendered him the individual that he was. Such, dr )Tj
T*(Johnson [sic] remarks, is the true end of biography, and he recommends the )Tj
T*(bringing forward of minute, yet characteristic details, as essential to this )Tj
T*(style of history; to follow which precept has been the aim and desire of the )Tj
T*(writer of these pages.[27])Tj
T*( )Tj

T*(Edward Moxon: "I should prefer quieter work, to be gathered from other )Tj
T*(worksâ€”such as my lives for the Cyclopediaâ€”&amp; which I think I do much better )Tj
T*(than romancing."[29] )Tj
T*( The 18th century had seen a new kind of history emerge, with works such as )Tj
T*(David Hume's History of England \(1754â€“63\). Frustrated with traditional )Tj
T*(histories that highlighted only military and monarchical history, Hume and )Tj
T*(others emphasised commerce, the arts, and society.[30] Combined with the rise )Tj
T*(of sensibility at the end of the 18th century, this "produced an unprecedented )Tj
T*(historical interest in the social, the inward, and particularly the realm of )Tj
T*(affect".[30] These topics and this style explicitly invited women into the )Tj
T*(discussion of history as both readers and writers.[30] However, since this new )Tj
T*(history often subordinated the private sphere to the public, women writers took )Tj
T*(it upon themselves to bring "sentimental and private elements" to the centre of )Tj
T*(historical study.[31] In this way, they argued for the political relevance of )Tj
T*(women, claiming, for example, that women's sympathy for those who suffered )Tj
T*(enabled them to speak for marginalised groups, such as slaves or the poor.[32] )Tj
T*( Shelley practised this early form of feminist historiography. Biographical )Tj
T*(writing was, in her words, supposed to "form as it were a school in which to )Tj
T*(study the philosophy of history" and to teach "lessons".[33] These "lessons" )Tj
T*(consisted, most frequently and importantly, of criticisms of male-dominated )Tj
T*(institutions, such as primogeniture.[34] She also praises societies that are )Tj
T*(progressive with regard to gender relationsâ€”she wrote, for example, "No slur )Tj
T*(was cast by the [Renaissance era] Italians on feminine accomplishmentsÂ ...Â )Tj
T*(Where abstruse learning was a fashion among men, they were glad to find in )Tj
T*(their friends of the other sex, minds educated to share their pursuits".[35] )Tj
T*( Shelley was particularly interested in tying private, domestic history to )Tj
T*(public, political history.[36] She emphasises romance, the family, sympathy, )Tj
T*(and compassion in the lives of the people she writes about. This is )Tj
T*(particularly true in her essays on Petrarch and Vincenzo Monti.[37] Her belief )Tj
T*(that these domestic influences would improve society, and that women could be )Tj
T*(at the forefront of them, ties her approach to that of other early feminist )Tj
T*(historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson.[38] Shelley argues that women )Tj
T*(possess a "distinctive virtue" in their ability to sympathise with others and )Tj
T*(should use this ability to improve society.[39] She castigates Jean-Jacques )Tj
T*(Rousseau, for example, for abandoning his children at a foundling hospital, )Tj
T*(decrying the "masculine egotism" associated with his philosophyâ€”a criticism )Tj
T*(similar to the one she makes of Victor Frankenstein in Frankenstein \(1818\).[40] )Tj
T*( Unlike most of her novels, which had a print run of only several hundred )Tj
T*(copies, the Lives's print run of about 4,000 for each volume became, in the )Tj
T*(words of one scholar, "one of her most influential political )Tj
T*(interventions".[41] However, Shelley's biographies have not been fully )Tj
T*(appreciated until recently. The Lives were not reprinted until 2002, and little )Tj
T*(study has been made of them because of a critical tradition that "dismiss[es] )Tj
T*(the Lives as hack work churned out rapidly in order to pay off debts".[22] )Tj

T*(Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, )Tj
T*(Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, )Tj
T*(Monti, and Ugo Foscolo.[45] Although there has been some confusion regarding )Tj
T*(the attribution of these biographies, the Lives's recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, )Tj
T*(notes that Shelley claimed authorship of all of these and granted Montgomery )Tj
T*(and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.[46] )Tj
T*( Shelley began the Italian Lives on 23 November 1833 and by December was )Tj
T*(working methodically: she wrote the Lives in the morning and read novels and )Tj
T*(memoirs in the evening.[42] She added the revision of her novel Lodore \(1835\) )Tj
T*(and the checking of its proofs to this already busy schedule.[42] She worked on )Tj
T*(the Italian Lives for two years and was probably paid Â£140 for each volume.[42] )Tj
T*(By the time she began working on the Lives, Shelley had spent 20 years studying )Tj
T*(Italian authors and had lived in Italy for five years.[47] Her major sources )Tj
T*(for the biographies were first-person memoirs and literature by the authors, )Tj
T*(aided by scholarly works.[47] Shelley had gained much of her knowledge of these )Tj
T*(authors in Italy when she was researching her historical novel Valperga \(1823\); )Tj
T*(the rest she obtained from her own books or those of her father, the )Tj
T*(philosopher William Godwin. She had limited access to books at this time and )Tj
T*(was thus restricted to those she owned or could borrow from friends.[48] )Tj
T*(Shelley copied sections from some of these works in a manner that would today )Tj
T*(be termed plagiarism, but, as Mazzeo explains, because the standards of )Tj
T*(intellectual property and copyright were so different in the early 19th )Tj
T*(century, Shelley's practice was common and not considered unethical. She )Tj
T*(writes, "Mary Shelley's objectives in the Italian Lives were to gather what had )Tj
T*(been said by these authors and about them and to infuse the work with her own )Tj
T*(judgements on their interest and credibility."[48] )Tj
T*( To supplement her printed sources, Shelley interviewed Gabriele Rossetti and )Tj
T*(other Italian expatriates in London for the modern biographies. Mazzeo writes )Tj
T*(that "her lives of the contemporary Italian poets â€“ Alfieri, Monti and Foscolo )Tj
T*(â€“ are unquestionably the most personal and most inspired of the two )Tj
T*(volumes".[49] Of all of the volumes Shelley contributed to the Cabinet )Tj
T*(Cyclopaedia, Italian Lives is, according to editor Nora Crook, the "most )Tj
T*(overtly political".[50] Shelley was a friend to the Italian exiles and a )Tj
T*(proponent of the Risorgimento;[51] she reveals her republicanism by depicting )Tj
T*(Machiavelli as a patriot.[50] She continually praises writers who resist )Tj
T*(tyranny by "cultivat[ing] private virtue and inner peace".[52] In the first )Tj
T*(volume of the Italian Lives her primary goal was to introduce lesser-known )Tj
T*(Italian writers to English readers and build up the reputation of those who )Tj
T*(were already known,[53] reflecting the view she expressed in her travel )Tj
T*(narrative Rambles in Germany and Italy \(1844\): "Italian literature claims, at )Tj
T*(present, a very high rank in Europe. If the writers are less numerous, yet in )Tj
T*(genius they equal, and in moral taste they surpass France and England".[54] )Tj
T*( Shelley specifically addressed gender politics in her biography of the )Tj
T*(16th-century poet Vittoria Colonna, highlighting her literary achievements, her )Tj
T*("virtues, talents, and beauty", and her interest in politics.[55] However, )Tj
T*(Shelley was careful to describe feminine virtues in their historical context )Tj
T*(throughout the Italian Lives. For example, her analysis of the cavalier )Tj
T*(servente system in Italy, which allowed married women to take lovers, was )Tj
T*(rooted in an understanding that many marriages at the time were made not for )Tj
T*(love, but for profit. She refused to indict any particular woman for what she )Tj
T*(saw as the faults of a larger system.[55] )Tj
T*( Little has been written on the contributions by Montgomery or Brewster. )Tj
T*(According to Mazzeo, Montgomery's biographies, which draw a picture of the )Tj
T*(subject's character and incorporate autobiographical material, are written in a )Tj
T*("digressive though not unengaging manner".[46] He is less concerned with )Tj
T*(factual accuracy, although he identifies his sources, and more interested in )Tj
T*(developing "extended parallels between Italian and English literature".[46] )Tj
T*(Brewster includes descriptions of 16th-century scientific experiments in his )Tj
T*(formally written biography of Galileo, as well as information on other )Tj
T*(Renaissance natural philosophers. According to Mazzeo, "Brewster's pious )Tj

T*( Ninety-eight review copies of the first two volumes were distributed, )Tj
T*(eliciting five reviews.[42] Some of these were simply short advertisements for )Tj
T*(the Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Mazzeo writes that the "commentary on both volumes was )Tj
T*(mixed and often contradictory, but on balance positive; prose style, )Tj
T*(organisation and use of source materials were the three most often identified )Tj
T*(points of discussion".[56] The first volume was declared to be unorganised, the )Tj
T*(second volume less so. Reviewers did not agree on the value of frequently using )Tj
T*(primary sources, nor on the elegance of the writing style.[56] The Monthly )Tj
T*(Review dedicated the most substantial review and extracts to the volumes, )Tj
T*(writing that "we by no means think highly of the volume as a whole", )Tj
T*(complaining that it presented facts and dates without context. However, the )Tj
T*(reviewer praised two of Mary Shelley's biographies: Petrarch and Machiavelli. )Tj
T*(According to Mazzeo, the reviewer "notes, in particular, her efforts to )Tj
T*(question conventional assumptions about Machiavelli by returning to )Tj
T*(autobiographical materials and credits her with originality on this )Tj
T*(point".[56]Graham's Magazine, in a piece probably by its co-editor, Edgar Allan )Tj
T*(Poe, positively reviewed the pirated American edition.[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] Spanish and Portuguese Lives )Tj
T*( The Spanish and Portuguese Lives constitute the third volume of the Lives of )Tj
T*(the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. )Tj
T*(Except for the biography of Ercilla, whose author is unknown, Mary Shelley )Tj
T*(wrote all of the entries in this volume: BoscÃ¡n, Garcilaso de la Vega, Diego )Tj

T*(Castillejo, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Vicente Espinel, Esteban de Villegas, )Tj
T*(GÃ³ngora, Quevedo, CalderÃ³n, Ribeiro, Gil Vicente, Ferreira, and Camoens. )Tj
T*( During the two or three years that Mary Shelley spent writing the Spanish and )Tj
T*(Portuguese Lives from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, Falkner )Tj
T*(\(1837\), experienced the death of her father, William Godwin, started a )Tj
T*(biography of him, and moved to London after her son, Percy Florence Shelley, )Tj
T*(entered Trinity College, Cambridge.[43] She had more difficulty with these )Tj
T*(Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria )Tj
T*(Gisborne: "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish &amp; Portugeeze [sic] )Tj
T*(Lives â€“ This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, &amp; the difficulty of )Tj
T*(getting books &amp; information".[58] According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor )Tj
T*(of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in )Tj
T*(England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects.[59] However, )Tj
T*(Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: "The best is that the very )Tj
T*(thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting â€“ namely â€“ the )Tj
T*(treading in unknown paths &amp; dragging out unknown things â€“ I wish I could go )Tj
T*(to Spain."[58] While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library )Tj
T*(in London, writing: "I would not if I could â€“ I do not like finding myself a )Tj
T*(stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [sic] to their )Tj
T*(own".[60] At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the )Tj
T*(reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of )Tj
T*("feminist protest" others see it as "matter of comfort and practicality", since )Tj
T*(the reading rooms were "noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated".[61] Shelley's )Tj
T*(continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on )Tj
T*(relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that "there is always a sense of an )Tj
T*(engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what )Tj
T*(seems accurate".[62] Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by )Tj
T*(people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were )Tj
T*(unavailable or poor, she provided her own.[63] )Tj
T*( Shelley's biographies begin by describing the author, offering examples of )Tj
T*(their writings in the original language and in translation, and end by )Tj
T*(summarising their "beauties and defects".[62] She also discusses the problems )Tj
T*(of writing biography itself, engaging in a written dialogue with the theories )Tj
T*(of her now-dead father. In "Of History and Romance" Godwin had written that for )Tj

T*(effects of this approach when Godwin published Memoirs of the Author of A )Tj
T*(Vindication of the Rights of Woman \(1798\), his biography of Shelley's mother, )Tj
T*(Mary Wollstonecraft. Its frank description of Wollstonecraft's affairs and )Tj
T*(suicide attempts shocked the public and sullied her reputation. Shelley )Tj
T*(criticises this technique in her biographies, concerned that such works )Tj

T*( Overall, the Spanish Lives, according to Vargo, "tells a story of the survival )Tj
T*(of genius and moral independence in spite of oppression by public institutions, )Tj
T*(both individually and nationally".[66] Shelley argues that Spain's literature )Tj
T*(is directly related to its politics and seeks to inspire her readers by )Tj
T*(outlining a national literature stretching back to Lucan which represents the )Tj
T*(best characteristics of Spanish identity:[67] "originality", "independence", )Tj

T*(â€”Mary Shelley, "Madame Roland", French Lives[69])Tj
T*( The two-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France )Tj
T*(includes the following works by Mary Shelley: Montaigne, Corneille, )Tj
T*(Rochefoucauld,[70]MoliÃ¨re, Pascal, Madame de SÃ©vignÃ©, Boileau, Racine, FÃ©nelon, )Tj
T*(Voltaire, Rousseau, Condorcet, Mirabeau, Madame Roland, and Madame de )Tj
T*(StaÃ«l.[71]Rabelais and La Fontaine are by an as yet unidentified author.[72] )Tj
T*(Shelley was the only contributor to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia to give such )Tj
T*(pride of place to female biographical subjects.[73] In these volumes, "she )Tj
T*(stretched the definition of 'Eminent Literary Men' not just by including two )Tj
T*(more women but by her choice of a quartet of French revolutionary personalities )Tj
T*(who were political actors more than, or as much as writers: Condorcet and )Tj
T*(Mirabeau, Mme Roland and Mme de StaÃ«l".[74] As Clarissa Campbell Orr, a recent )Tj
T*(editor of the French Lives, explains, this choice "represents a concerted )Tj
T*(attempt to disassociate the early ideals of the French Revolution from its )Tj
T*(subsequent extremism and state-authored bloodshed".[75] )Tj
T*( Mary Shelley worked on the French Lives from the end of 1837 until the middle )Tj
T*(of 1839 and she was paid Â£200 upon their completion.[76] No other substantial )Tj
T*(projects occupied her during this time and research materials were easily )Tj
T*(accessible; she even subscribed to a specialist circulating library to acquire )Tj
T*(books.[72] She wrote to her friend Leigh Hunt of the project, "I am now writing )Tj
T*(French Lives. The Spanish ones interested meâ€”these do not so much â€“ yet, it is )Tj
T*(pleasant writing enough â€“ sparing one imagination yet occupying one &amp; )Tj
T*(supplying in some small degree the needful which is so very needful."[77] )Tj
T*( Mary Shelley spoke French fluently and was knowledgeable about 17th- and )Tj
T*(18th-century French literature.[23] Although she was distilling other works, )Tj
T*(the biographies are still deeply personal works and have autobiographical )Tj

T*(Lardner, and represent the final stage of a sustained overview of four )Tj
T*(literatures. Few British women of letters in the 1830s could command this )Tj
T*(extensive range and write so confidently about four national cultures."[23] Orr )Tj
T*(compares Shelley to the 19th-century historical writers Lady Morgan, Frances )Tj
T*(Trollope, Anna Jameson, and Agnes and Eliza Strickland.[78] Shelley's )Tj

T*(the biographies are "written with a sprightly narrative thrust and an agreeable )Tj
T*(tone".[80] She also often provided her own translations and focused on themes )Tj
T*(that resonated with her own life.[81] )Tj
T*( The French Lives provided Shelley with a way to celebrate literary women, )Tj
T*(particularly salonniÃ©res. In her life of Madame de SÃ©vignÃ©, Shelley celebrates )Tj
T*("her chaste widowhood; her loyalty as a friend; [and] her maternal )Tj
T*(devotion".[82] However, Orr writes that it is difficult to see a pattern in the )Tj
T*(way Shelley addresses gender issues in these volumes.[83] She argues that "the )Tj
T*(most consistent 'feminism' displayed throughout [the second volume of French )Tj
T*(Lives] lies in her examination of French attitudes toward love, marriage, and )Tj
T*(sexuality".[83] Shelley sympathetically portrays customs such as taking lovers, )Tj
T*(explaining the custom in the context of France's arranged marriages.[83] )Tj
T*(Overall, Orr explains, Shelley's "historical sympathy for the varied )Tj
T*(circumstances of women's relationships mirrors her personal practice of )Tj
T*(understanding and assisting those of her women friends who transgressed moral )Tj
T*(norms".[83] The biographies of Roland and StaÃ«l focus on their abilities and )Tj
T*(the social forces that both helped and hindered them from succeeding.[39] )Tj
T*(Shelley argues that women are as intellectually capable as men, but lack a )Tj
T*(sufficient education and are trapped by social systems such as marriage that )Tj
T*(restrict their rights.[39] The emphasis that Shelley places on education and )Tj
T*(reading reflect the influence of her mother's A Vindication of the Rights of )Tj
T*(Woman \(1792\). In these two biographies, Shelley reinforces contemporary gender )Tj
T*(roles while at the same time celebrating the achievements of these women.[84] )Tj
T*(She describes Roland through traditionally feminine roles: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(She was her husband's friend, companion, amanuensis; fearful of the temptations )Tj
T*(of the world, she gave herself up to labour; she soon became absolutely )Tj
T*(necessary to him at every moment, and in all the incidents of his life; her )Tj
T*(servitude was thus sealed; now and then it caused a sigh; but the holy sense of )Tj
T*(duty reconciled her to every inconvenience.[85])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Shelley also defends Roland's "unwomanly" actions, however, by arguing that )Tj
T*(they were "beneficial" to French society.[86] Shelley's most overt feminist )Tj
T*(statement in the French Lives comes when she criticises Jean-Jacques Rousseau's )Tj
T*(novel Julie, or the New Heloise \(1761\), writing "his ideasÂ ...Â of a perfect )Tj
T*(life are singularly faulty. It includes no instruction, no endeavours to )Tj
T*(acquire knowledge and refine the soul by study; but is contracted to mere )Tj
T*(domestic avocations".[87] )Tj
T*( Sixty review copies of each volume were sent out, but only one short notice of )Tj
T*(the first volume of French Lives has been located, in the Sunday Times.[80] The )Tj
T*(volumes were pirated in the United States by Lea and Blanchard of Philadelphia )Tj
T*(and reviewed by Edgar Allan Poe in Graham's Lady's and Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine in )Tj

T*( The Noisy Miner \(Manorina melanocephala\) is a bird in the honeyeater family )Tj
T*(Meliphagidae and is endemic to eastern and south-eastern Australia. This miner )Tj
T*(is a grey bird, with a black head, orange-yellow beak and feet, a distinctive )Tj
T*(yellow patch behind the eye and white tips on the tail feathers. The Tasmanian )Tj
T*(race has a more intense yellow panel in the wing, and a broader white tip to )Tj
T*(the tail. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance, though young )Tj
T*(birds are a brownish-grey. As the common name suggests, the Noisy Miner is a )Tj
T*(vocal species with a large range of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, and )Tj
T*(almost constant vocalizations particularly from young birds. One of four )Tj
T*(species in the genus Manorina, the Noisy Miner itself is divided into four )Tj
T*(subspecies. The separation of the Tasmanian M.Â m.Â leachi is of long standing, )Tj
T*(and the mainland birds were further split in 1999. )Tj
T*( Found in a broad arc from Far North Queensland through New South Wales and )Tj
T*(Victoria to Tasmania and eastern South Australia, the Noisy Miner primarily )Tj
T*(inhabits dry, open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs. These include )Tj
T*(forests dominated by spotted gum, box and ironbark, as well as in degraded )Tj
T*(woodland where the understory has been cleared, such as recently burned areas, )Tj
T*(farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, and suburban parks and gardens )Tj
T*(with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery. The density of Noisy Miner )Tj
T*(populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range, )Tj
T*(particularly human-dominated habitats. While the popularity of nectar-producing )Tj
T*(garden plants such as the large-flowered grevilleas was thought to play a role )Tj
T*(in its proliferation, studies now show that the Noisy Miner has benefitted )Tj
T*(primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by )Tj
T*(eucalypts. )Tj
T*( Noisy Miners are gregarious and territorial; they forage, bathe, roost, breed )Tj
T*(and defend territory communally, forming colonies that can contain several )Tj
T*(hundred birds. Each bird has an 'activity space' and birds with overlapping )Tj
T*(activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', the most stable units )Tj
T*(within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks called 'coalitions' for )Tj
T*(specific activities such as mobbing a predator. Group cohesion is facilitated )Tj
T*(not only by vocalizations, but also through ritualised displays which have been )Tj
T*(categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. The )Tj
T*(Noisy Miner is a notably aggressive bird, and chasing, pecking, fighting, )Tj
T*(scolding, and mobbing occur throughout the day, targeted at both intruders and )Tj
T*(colony members. )Tj
T*( Foraging in the canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on the ground, )Tj
T*(the Noisy Miner mainly eats nectar, fruit and insects. Most time is spent )Tj
T*(gleaning the foliage of eucalypts, and it can meet most of its nutritional )Tj
T*(needs from manna, honeydew and lerp gathered from the foliage. The Noisy Miner )Tj
T*(does not use a stereotyped courtship display, but copulation is a frenzied )Tj
T*(communal event. It breeds all year long, building a deep cup-shaped nest and )Tj
T*(laying two to four eggs. Incubation is by the female only, although up to )Tj
T*(twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings. Noisy Miners )Tj
T*(have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including )Tj
T*(multiple broods and group mobbing of predators. The Noisy Miner's population )Tj

T*(increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in )Tj
T*(human-affected landscapes. Its territoriality means that translocation is )Tj
T*(unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance, and culling has been proposed, )Tj
T*(although the Noisy Miner is currently a protected species across Australia. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( English ornithologist John Latham described the Noisy Miner four times in his )Tj
T*(1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae, )Tj
T*(seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case: the Chattering )Tj
T*(Bee-eater \(Merops garrulus\), Black-headed Grakle \(Gracula melanocephala\), )Tj
T*(Hooded Bee-eater \(Merops cucullatus\), and White-fronted Bee-eater \(Merops )Tj
T*(albifrons\).[2][3] Early notes recorded its tendency to scare off prey as )Tj
T*(hunters were about to shoot.[3] It was as the Chattering Bee-eater that it was )Tj
T*(painted between 1792 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known )Tj
T*(collectively as the Port Jackson Painter.[4]John Gould treated the name Merops )Tj
T*(garrulus as the original description, and renamed it Myzantha garrula in his )Tj
T*(1865 work Handbook to the Birds of Australia, giving it the common name of )Tj
T*(Garrulous Honeyeater, and noting the alternate name of Chattering Honeyeater. )Tj
T*(He noted the colonists of Tasmania called it a miner, and aboriginal people of )Tj
T*(New South Wales called it cobaygin.[5]Que que gang was a local aboriginal name )Tj
T*(from the Blue Mountains.[6] )Tj
T*( However, in the early 20th century Australian ornithologists started using the )Tj
T*(name Manorina melanocephala instead, because it was listed first by Latham in )Tj
T*(1801.[7] This usage did not follow the letter of the International Code of )Tj
T*(Zoological Nomenclature, and in 2009 the International Commission on Zoological )Tj
T*(Nomenclature conserved the current name by formally suppressing the name M.Â )Tj
T*(garrula.[8] The species name melanocephala is derived from the Ancient Greek )Tj
T*(words melas "black", and kephale "head",[9] referring to its black crown. Other )Tj
T*(common names include Mickey Miner and Soldierbird. Four subspecies are )Tj
T*(recognised, including subspecies leachi found in eastern Tasmania. The mainland )Tj
T*(population was split into three subspecies in 1999 by Richard Schoddeâ€”titaniota )Tj
T*(from Cape York Peninsula in Queensland as far south as Mareeba, lepidota from )Tj
T*(central Queensland and inland New South Wales west of Nyngan, and the nominate )Tj
T*(subspecies melanocephala from southeastern New South Wales, Victoria, and )Tj
T*(southern South Australia. There are broad zones where birds are intermediate )Tj
T*(between subspecies.[10] Further study is required to settle the taxonomic )Tj
T*(status of these populations. )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner is one of four species in the genus Manorina in the large )Tj
T*(family of honeyeaters known as Meliphagidae, the other three being the )Tj
T*(Black-eared Miner \(M.Â melanotis\), the Yellow-throated Miner \(M.Â flavigula\), and )Tj
T*(the Bell Miner \(M.Â melanophrys\). One of the most obvious characteristics of the )Tj
T*(genus is a patch of bare yellow skin behind the eyes, which gives them an odd )Tj
T*('cross-eyed' look. Within the genus, the Noisy, Black-eared and Yellow-throated )Tj
T*(Miners form the subgenus Myzantha.[10] The Noisy Miner occasionally hybridizes )Tj
T*(with the Yellow-throated Miner.Molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be )Tj
T*(related to the Pardalotidae \(pardalotes\), Acanthizidae \(Australian warblers, )Tj
T*(scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.\), and the Maluridae \(Australian fairy-wrens\) in a )Tj
T*(large Meliphagoidea superfamily.[12] )Tj

T*( The Noisy Miner is similar in appearance to the Yellow-throated Miner and the )Tj
T*(Black-eared Miner; however it has a dull white forehead and a black crown, )Tj
T*(while the others have grey heads. )Tj
T*( [edit] Geographical variations )Tj
T*( Size variation in the Noisy Miner over its range follows Bergmann's rule; )Tj
T*(namely, birds tend to be larger where the climate is colder.[10] Adults from )Tj
T*(central-eastern and northern Queensland tend to have little or no olive-yellow )Tj
T*(edging to the feathers of the back and wings, and have a wider white fringe on )Tj
T*(the feathers of the hind-neck and back, giving birds from Queensland the )Tj
T*(appearance of having more distinctive scalloping than other populations. Wing )Tj
T*(length generally increases with latitude and M.Â m.Â leachi has measurably )Tj
T*(shorter wings than the nominate race, although no significant difference in )Tj
T*(wing length was found in a study of populations north of 30Â° S and south of the )Tj
T*(Murray River. The subspecies leachi also has finer scalloping on the hind-neck )Tj
T*(than the nominate race, a more intense yellow tinge to the wing panels, and a )Tj
T*(slightly broader off-white tip to the tail. )Tj
T*( The far north Queensland subspecies titaniota has a shorter tail, paler crown, )Tj
T*(larger yellow skin patch, and paler upper parts without the yellow-olive of the )Tj
T*(nominate race; and lepidota, found in western New South Wales, is smaller than )Tj
T*(the nominate race with a black crown, and darker more mottled upperparts.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Vocalisations )Tj
T*( As the common name suggests, the Noisy Miner is an unusually vocal species. )Tj
T*(Previously known as the Garrulous Honeyeater, it has a large and varied )Tj
T*(repertoire of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms. Most are loud and )Tj
T*(penetrating, and consist of harsh single notes. It has two broad-frequency )Tj
T*(alarm calls that are used when mobbing intruders into their territory, or when )Tj
T*(predators \(including humans\) are sighted; and a narrow-frequency alarm call )Tj
T*(that is primarily used when airborne predators are seen, such as the Brown )Tj
T*(Falcon \(Falco berigora\), or other large flying birds including the Australian )Tj
T*(Magpie \(Cracticus tibicen\) and the Pied Currawong \(Strepera graculina\).[17] The )Tj
T*(aerial predator alarm call is a series of high-pitched, slurred whistling )Tj
T*(notes. The broad-frequency alarm calls are a series of 'churr' notes, low )Tj
T*(pitched and harsh, occurring at low and high levels of intensity. The )Tj
T*(narrow-band call is used in situations where the bird signals the presence of a )Tj
T*(predator and restricts information about its own location, while the broad-band )Tj
T*(alarm is used to attract attention,[18] and can initiate mobbing behaviour. )Tj
T*(These churring calls vary between individuals,[19] and laboratory tests show )Tj
T*(Noisy Miners can distinguish calls by different birds. Hence, this may be )Tj
T*(integral to the complex social structure of the species.[20] )Tj
T*( Contact or social facilitation calls are low-pitched sounds that carry long )Tj
T*(distances. 'Chip' calls are given by individual birds when foraging, and a )Tj
T*(similar call is given by nestlings that call at an increased rate as the mother )Tj
T*(approaches the nest.[17] Where there is a high level of social activity, such )Tj
T*(as during territorial disputes with conspecifics, calls are a series of quick, )Tj
T*(regular, single notes. The Noisy Miner has a mating display flight song, a soft )Tj
T*(warble of low-frequency notes, given during short undulating flights by the )Tj
T*(male, and responded to by the female with a low-frequency whistle.[17] The )Tj
T*(Noisy Miner is found in open woodland habitats, where it is an advantage to )Tj
T*(call from the air so as to overcome sound attenuation.[21] Another display )Tj
T*(call, described as 'yammer', is a rapid rhythmical series of notes that is )Tj
T*(uttered during open-bill, wing-waving displays. The Noisy Miner has a song )Tj
T*(described as the 'dawn song'â€”a communal song of clear whistled notes emitted in )Tj
T*(chorus in the early hours of the morning from May through January.[17] The dawn )Tj
T*(song, which is also sung at dusk, is audible over long distances and features )Tj
T*(duets that often involve antiphony. )Tj
T*( A nestling begins to give the 'chip' call soon after it emerges from the egg, )Tj
T*(and it calls frequently for the first two thirds of the nestling period and )Tj
T*(constantly for the last third. The call does not vary in the presence of an )Tj
T*(adult at the nest, so it seems likely that the call is not directed at the )Tj
T*(adult bird. The nestling becomes silent when an adult gives an alarm call, and )Tj

T*(rate of calling, on average, is 85 to 100 calls in a minute, and in open scrub )Tj
T*(the call can be heard up to a kilometre away. Subsong, a juvenile vocalization )Tj
T*(comprising elements of various calls, begins to be uttered when the fledgling )Tj
T*(is around thirty days old. )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner also produces non-vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its )Tj
T*(bill, usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species, or when )Tj
T*(mobbing a predator. )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner is endemic to eastern and south-eastern Australia, occupying a )Tj
T*(broad arc from Far North Queensland where there are scattered populations, to )Tj
T*(New South Wales where it is widespread and common from the coast to a line from )Tj
T*(Angledool to Balranald, through Victoria into south-eastern South Australia, )Tj
T*(and eastern Tasmania. Its range in South Australia has been steadily expanding )Tj
T*(since it was first recorded near Adelaide in the early 1890s. It is sedentary )Tj
T*(over its entire range. The Noisy Miner is territorial, and the territory of a )Tj
T*(colony is aggressively defendedâ€”which has led to a significant reduction in )Tj
T*(avian diversity in areas occupied by the Noisy Miner, with smaller species )Tj
T*(excluded.[26] )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner primarily inhabits dry, open eucalypt forests without )Tj
T*(understory shrubs. It is commonly found in open sclerophyll forests, including )Tj
T*(those on coastal dunes or granite outcrops; forests dominated by spotted gum on )Tj
T*(mountain ridges and exposed slopes; box and ironbark forests on the foothills )Tj
T*(of the Great Dividing Range; mixed forests of eucalypts and cypress )Tj
T*(\(Callitris\); forests dominated by yapunya, mulga, gidgee, brigalow or emu bush; )Tj
T*(in stands of belah and scattered clumps of boree; on the edges of woodlands of )Tj
T*(river red gum including swamp woodlands bordering floodplains, and areas )Tj
T*(dominated by exotic species such as European ash and willow. It regularly )Tj
T*(inhabits degraded patches of forest where the understory has been cleared, )Tj
T*(including recently burned areas, and modified habitats such as lightly-timbered )Tj
T*(farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, bushland remnants in towns and )Tj
T*(cities, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense )Tj
T*(shrubbery. )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner has benefited from the thinning of woodland on rural )Tj
T*(properties, heavy grazing that removes the understory, fragmentation of )Tj
T*(woodland that increases the percentage of edge habitat, and urban landscaping )Tj
T*(practices that increase open eucalypt environments. It has been described as a )Tj
T*(â€˜reverse keystoneâ€™ species, as it is colonizing an ever-increasing range of )Tj
T*(human-dominated habitats, and aggressively excluding smaller bird species from )Tj
T*(urban environments.[26] This phenomenon has been also observed in rural areas. )Tj
T*(A field study across the South West Slopes of New South Wales, showed that the )Tj
T*(Noisy Miner's presence corresponded with reduced numbers of insectivorous birds )Tj
T*(such as fantails, whistlers, the Restless Flycatcher \(Myiagra inquieta\), and )Tj
T*(other honeyeater species, and that this decrease was most marked in sites with )Tj
T*(better access to water and nutrients.[28] While it has been hypothesized that )Tj
T*(the proliferation of large-flowering grevillea cultivars has contributed to the )Tj
T*(abundance of Noisy Miners, recent research has identified the proliferation of )Tj
T*(lightly treed open areas, and the presence of eucalypt species as the most )Tj
T*(significant factors in the population increase.[26] Large-flowered grevillea )Tj
T*(hybrids such as Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' can benefit the Noisy Miner, in that )Tj
T*(an abundance of resources is usually dominated by larger aggressive )Tj
T*(honeyeaters,[29] and a continuous nectar source could provide an advantage for )Tj
T*(the non-migratory species.[30] A field study in box-ironbark country in central )Tj
T*(Victoria found miner numbers were correlated with the occurrence of yellow gum )Tj
T*(\(Eucalyptus leucoxylon\), which reliably produces flowers \(and nectar\) each )Tj
T*(year.[31] However, the abundance of the Noisy Miner is primarily determined by )Tj
T*(habitat structure.[32][33] )Tj

T*(densities of Noisy Miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick )Tj
T*(understory in southern Queensland, 20 kilometres \(12Â mi\) or more from the )Tj
T*(forest/agricultural land edge. Many of these sites have extensive road networks )Tj
T*(used for forest management, and picnic areas and walking tracks for )Tj
T*(recreational use, and it has been found that these cleared spaces play a role )Tj
T*(in the abundance of Noisy Miners in the forests.[35] There is evidence to )Tj
T*(suggest that higher road densities correspond with higher Noisy Miner )Tj
T*(population levels.[36] Field work in Victoria showed Noisy Miners infiltrated )Tj
T*(anywhere from 150 to 300 m \(490 to 980 ft\) into remnant woodland from the )Tj
T*(edges, with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas. This )Tj
T*(has implications for the size of woodland habitat needed to contain miner-free )Tj
T*(areasâ€”around 36Â hectares \(89 acres\).[37] Revegetation projects restoring buloke )Tj
T*(woodland, a species of she-oak integral to the survival of the Red-tailed Black )Tj
T*(Cockatoo \(Calyptorynchus banksii\), have been interplanted with a nurse species, )Tj
T*(usually fast-growing Eucalypts. Noisy Miner populations were more likely in )Tj
T*(those buloke woodlands where Eucalypts had been planted at densities of up to )Tj
T*(16 per hectare \(6.4 per acre\). The presence of Noisy Miners was accompanied by )Tj
T*(a substantial difference in number and types of other birds found in the )Tj

T*(hundred birds )Tj
T*( Within a colony, a male bird will occupy an 'activity space', which will )Tj
T*(overlap with the activity spaces of other males. Males with overlapping )Tj
T*(activity spaces form associations called 'coteries', usually consisting of 10 )Tj
T*(to 25 birds. Coteries are the most stable unit within the colony. The birds )Tj
T*(also form temporary flocks when engaged in the same activity. These flocks, )Tj
T*(called 'coalitions', usually comprise five to eight birds, although coalitions )Tj
T*(of up to 40 birds can occur when mobbing a potential predator. Membership of )Tj
T*(the coalition changes frequently as individuals leave the group as it passes )Tj
T*(beyond the boundary of their activity space, or the activity ends or changes, )Tj
T*(as when the breeding season begins. Females use activity spaces that overlap )Tj
T*(with those of male birds, but not other females, so that females will join )Tj
T*(coalitions with males in their area, but only rarely will there be more than )Tj
T*(one female in the coalition. The exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to )Tj
T*(young females being driven out of the colony in which they were born, but it )Tj
T*(also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony. A study of )Tj
T*(banded nestlings that survived in one colony until the next breeding season, )Tj
T*(found that they were all male birds, suggesting that all female nestlings had )Tj
T*(died or left the colony. Emigration of males does not seem to occur until the )Tj
T*(population density of the colony reaches a critical level. )Tj
T*( Looking after the young is communal, with males of the coterie bringing food )Tj
T*(to the nestlings and removing faecal sacs. Communal feeding increases after )Tj
T*(fledging, when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to the young )Tj
T*(birds if not driven off. Roosting is usually communal, with two to six adults )Tj
T*(and juveniles roosting in contact with each other, usually near the end of a )Tj
T*(hanging branch up to 20 metres \(66Â ft\) above ground, within their activity )Tj
T*(space. They select a new site each evening, often selecting and rejecting )Tj

T*(attempt to join the group. They are often the last birds to roost at night, but )Tj
T*(appear to sleep soundly, undisturbed by torchlight. Noisy miners drink together )Tj
T*(at the edge of lakes and dams, and from cattle troughs, often perching on a )Tj
T*(submerged branch. They bathe by diving head first into water and, when almost )Tj
T*(totally submerged, flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads )Tj
T*(under the water. They shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to )Tj
T*(preen. They have been observed using rain- or dew-soaked foliage to bathe, and )Tj

T*( [edit] Flock behaviour )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner engages in most activities in a group. Roosting, foraging, )Tj
T*(preening, bathing and dust-bathing or anting are communal activities. Dawn song )Tj
T*(is a communal chorus, particularly during the breeding season. The communal )Tj
T*(interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as )Tj
T*(flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. In 'long flight' )Tj
T*(displays, initiated by either male or female birds, groups of up to twenty )Tj
T*(birds from more than one coterie fly about 40 metres \(130Â ft\) above the canopy )Tj
T*(for distances of up to 1.5 kilometres \(0.93Â mi\) from the colony, constantly )Tj
T*(calling and not returning to the colony for about twenty minutes. As they )Tj
T*(return the remaining birds show signs of agitation, and sometimes fly up to )Tj
T*(join them. The 'short flight' display is performed by the male, and may be )Tj
T*(analogous to the territorial advertising displays of other birds. In a )Tj
T*(ritualised movement, the Noisy Miner flies out from a perch across an open )Tj
T*(area, in a rhythmic undulating pattern, usually calling in flight. At the end )Tj
T*(of the clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch )Tj
T*(near the starting point. The 'head-up flight' is performed by the female during )Tj
T*(the nesting period, and may function to attract male helpers. In its most )Tj
T*(intense form the body and tail are held almost vertically, with legs dangling )Tj
T*(and the head held up and back. It is performed by the female when she is )Tj
T*(selecting the nest site, and when carrying nest-building material, and probably )Tj
T*(has the function of indicating the location of the nest to other group )Tj
T*(members.[43] )Tj
T*( Postural displays include tall and low poses, pointing, open bill, and wing )Tj
T*(waving. The 'tall posture' is used when in close contact with another bird and )Tj
T*(is a mild threat. The bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched, )Tj
T*(and it faces the other bird. The 'low posture' is a submissive gesture; the )Tj
T*(bird sits low on the perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often )Tj
T*(faces away from the other bird. Fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt )Tj
T*(a low posture and open their bill widely. 'Pointing' is a threat display where )Tj
T*(the bird stretches out horizontally, with feathers sleeked and the bill pointed )Tj
T*(at the target of the aggression. A bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing. )Tj
T*(An 'open bill display' is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds, )Tj
T*(and by a female on the nest when other birds approach. The 'trident bill )Tj
T*(display' involves a fully open bill with the tongue raised and protruding and )Tj
T*(is a higher-intensity submissive display. 'Wing waving' is often performed at )Tj
T*(the same time as an open bill display. The wings are flexed and held slightly )Tj
T*(away from the body, and flapped out and up around three to six times. Wing )Tj
T*(waving may be accompanied by a yammer call. 'Eagle' displays involve holding )Tj
T*(the wings and tail spread out, in either a vertical or horizontal position.[43] )Tj
T*( Eye displays are made by exposing or covering the bare yellow patch behind the )Tj
T*(eyeâ€”when the feathers are completely sleeked the entire patch is visible, and )Tj
T*(when they are fluffed the patch is hidden. Eye displays are used in conjunction )Tj
T*(with postural displays, with the yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds )Tj
T*(using threat postures, and immature birds tending to reduce the size of the eye )Tj
T*(patch when under attack from other members of the coterie.[43] )Tj
T*( On occasion early in the breeding season, mass displays erupt, where twenty or )Tj
T*(thirty birds perform the various wing-spreading displays, short flights, and )Tj
T*(constant calling. Displaying birds are attacked by others, and groups of silent )Tj
T*(but agitated birds watch the interactions. Mass displays are more common in the )Tj
T*(early morning, can last for up to 40 minutes, and seem to be a combination of )Tj
T*(sexual and agonistic behaviour. )Tj
T*( A 'corroboree' \(from the word for a ceremonial meeting of Aboriginal )Tj
T*(Australians\) is a group display where birds converge on adjacent branches and )Tj
T*(simultaneously pose hunchbacked, giving wing-waving and open-bill displays and )Tj
T*(the yammer call. A corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in the )Tj
T*(social environment, such as a bird returning after an absence, or the repulsion )Tj
T*(of an intruder, or the coming together of different coteries. The corroboree )Tj

T*( [edit] Agonistic behaviour )Tj
T*( Described as "always at war with others of the feathered kind" in early )Tj
T*(notes,[3] the Noisy Miner is one of the most aggressive of the honeyeaters. )Tj
T*(Much of the activity within a Noisy Miner colony is agonistic with chasing, )Tj
T*(pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occurring frequently throughout the )Tj
T*(day. The birds unite to attack predators and to defend the colony area against )Tj
T*(all other species of birds; however the species is also highly aggressive )Tj
T*(intraspecifically.[44] )Tj
T*( Female Noisy Miners are aggressive towards each other, and one cause of a )Tj
T*(male-biased sex-ratio in colonies may be the femalesâ€™ greater intolerance for )Tj
T*(each other, driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration )Tj
T*(of new females. Aggression at the nest is common between males. Adult males )Tj
T*(begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old, and attackers can )Tj
T*(include males that previously cared for the fledgling. Adult females are less )Tj
T*(aggressive towards young birds, although mothers do occasionally attack their )Tj
T*(own offspring, and infanticide has been recorded. There is little male to )Tj
T*(female aggression other than the 'driving flights' that form part of the mating )Tj
T*(ritual. In direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at the eye patch. )Tj
T*(Agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings, with aggression )Tj
T*(intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling. )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner colony unites to mob inter-specific intruders and predators. )Tj
T*(The Noisy Miner will approach the threat closely and point, expose eye patches, )Tj
T*(and often bill-snap. Five to fifteen birds will fly around the intruder, some )Tj
T*(birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking the intruder. The )Tj
T*(mobbing continues until the intruder remains still, as with a Tawny Frogmouth )Tj
T*(\(Podargus strigoides\), or it leaves the area. Mobbing of snakes and Goannas is )Tj
T*(particularly intense, and most species of bird, even non-predators, entering )Tj
T*(the territory are immediately chased. The Noisy Miner has been recorded )Tj
T*(attacking an Australian Owlet-nightjar \(Aegotheles cristatus\) during the day, )Tj
T*(grebes, herons, ducks and cormorants on lakes at the edge of territories, )Tj
T*(Crested Pigeons \(Ocyphaps lophotes\), pardalotes, and rosellas. Non-predatory )Tj
T*(mammals such as bats, cattle, sheep, and wallabies are also attacked, though )Tj
T*(less vigorously than birds. )Tj
T*( Noisy Miner attacks are not limited to chasing the intruder, and aggressive )Tj
T*(incidents often result in the death of the trespasser. Reports include those of )Tj
T*(two Noisy Miners repeatedly pecking a House Sparrow \(Passer domesticus\) at the )Tj
T*(base of its skull and killing it in six minutes; one Noisy Miner grasping a )Tj
T*(Striated Pardalote \(Pardalotus striatus\) by the wing while another pecked it on )Tj
T*(the head until it died; and a Sacred Kingfisher \(Todiramphus sanctus\) being )Tj
T*(chased and harassed for over five hours and then found dead with a fractured )Tj
T*(skull.[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] Response to threats )Tj
T*( Noisy Miners make louder alarm calls in noisier sections of urban )Tj
T*(environments, such as main roads.[46] The most common initial response to alarm )Tj
T*(calls is to stay in the area and scan for threats, rather than withdraw. A )Tj
T*(study conducted in Melbourne and a nearby rural area found that Noisy Miners in )Tj
T*(urban areas were less likely to take flight, and when they did they flew )Tj
T*(shorter distances. It is unclear whether this is an adaptation or bolder miners )Tj
T*(had been the ones to settle in the city.[47] A field study in Canberra found )Tj
T*(that Superb Fairywrens \(Malurus cyaneus\) that lived in areas frequented by )Tj
T*(Noisy Miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to )Tj
T*(ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by )Tj
T*(Noisy Miners did not respond to miner alarm calls. This suggests the species )Tj
T*(has adapted and learnt to discriminate and respond to another species' )Tj
T*(vocalisations.[48] )Tj

T*( In a study of birds foraging in suburban gardens, the Noisy Miner was seen to )Tj
T*(spend more time in banksia, grevillea and eucalypt species, and when in flower, )Tj
T*(Callistemon, than in other plants including exotics. Most time was spent )Tj
T*(gleaning the foliage of Eucalypts, and Noisy Miners were significantly more )Tj

T*( In the first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single )Tj
T*(species, the Noisy Miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies )Tj
T*(depending upon the resource it was foraging. When searching for nectar, which )Tj
T*(does not move but is readily depleted, the Noisy Miner uses a spatial )Tj
T*(memory-based strategy, identifying characteristics of the environmentâ€”a )Tj
T*(strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes )Tj
T*(in the birdâ€™s activities. When searching for invertebrates, however, it appears )Tj
T*(to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement \(they )Tj
T*(improve at finding invertebrates with practice\). The two different strategies )Tj
T*(imply the existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms, capable of responding )Tj
T*(appropriately to different foraging contexts.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Breeding )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display; displays can )Tj
T*(involve â€˜drivingâ€™ where the male jumps or flies at the female from 1â€“2 metres )Tj
T*(\(3.3â€“6.6Â ft\) away, and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively. The )Tj
T*(female may perform a â€˜bowed-wing displayâ€™ where the wings and tail are spread )Tj
T*(and quivered, with the wings arched and the head pointing down. The male may )Tj
T*(adopt a vertical or horizontal â€˜eagle displayâ€™ with wings and tail spread wide )Tj
T*(and held still for several seconds. Copulation is frequent and conspicuous, )Tj
T*(with both males and females copulating with several birds, while other members )Tj
T*(of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair.[43] )Tj
T*(Copulation usually occurs on larger, exposed branches close to the nest site )Tj
T*(and can occur at any time of the day, although slightly more often between )Tj
T*(11:00 and 13:00 when communal activities are less frequent. The frenzied )Tj
T*(courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously )Tj
T*(to recruit males to help care for the young, however recent genetic testing )Tj
T*(shows that 96.5% of Noisy Miner broods result from monogamous mating and that )Tj
T*(multiple paternity is rare. An observation of banded birds noted that while )Tj
T*(females copulated repeatedly, it was always with the same male. Mate switching )Tj
T*(between broods is uncommon, with pairs staying together over several years.[53] )Tj

T*(raising young. The nest is built in prickly or leafy trees, and the Noisy Miner )Tj
T*(is often recorded nesting in eucalypts, and also in wattles, Araucaria, )Tj
T*(Banksia, Bursaria, Hibiscus, mistletoe, Melaleuca, Pittosporum, Schinus and )Tj
T*(jacaranda. It seems to prefer moderately dense foliage for nesting, often near )Tj
T*(the end of drooping horizontal branches. Support for the nest may be the )Tj
T*(primary criterion of a suitable nest site, rather than characteristics of the )Tj
T*(vegetation or location.[54] The female alone builds the nest, which is deep and )Tj
T*(cup-shaped, woven of twigs and grasses with other plant material, animal hair )Tj
T*(and spider webs. Occasionally the nest will include man-made materials such as )Tj
T*(twine, scraps of material, and tissue paper. It is lined with wool, hair, )Tj
T*(feathers, flowers or plant down, and padded with a circular mat woven from )Tj
T*(fibres pulled from the cocoons of the processional caterpillar. The female )Tj
T*(Noisy Miner walks around on the ground close to the nest site, picking up )Tj
T*(material.[54] She gathers material from disused nests of other birds, or )Tj
T*(dismantles its most recent nest to build a new one. The female completes the )Tj
T*(nest in five or six days.[54] On average nests have an external diameter of )Tj
T*(15â€“17.8 centimetres \(5.9â€“7.0Â in\) and an external depth of 9â€“11.4 centimetres )Tj
T*(\(3.5â€“4.5Â in\). The internal depth of the nest is around 5.5 centimetres \(2.2Â )Tj
T*(in\). )Tj
T*( Eggs vary greatly in size, shape and markings, but are generally elongated )Tj
T*(ovals; white to cream or pinkish or buff coloured; freckled, spotted or )Tj
T*(blotched with reddish brown to chestnut or a purplish red, sometimes with )Tj
T*(underlying markings of violet or purplish grey. The clutch consists of two to )Tj
T*(four eggs. Incubation is by the female only, and the incubation period is )Tj
T*(around sixteen days. Hatching is asynchronous, with up to six days being )Tj
T*(recorded between the hatching of the first and last chicks in a clutch. Young )Tj
T*(are naked at hatching, and develop a cover of down within two to three days. )Tj
T*(The fledging period is around sixteen days, and young begin to find food for )Tj
T*(themselves between twenty-six and thirty days after fledging, but are still )Tj
T*(regularly fed by adults to thirty-five days. The young leave the nest before )Tj
T*(they are fully fledged, and only able to fly downwards, and scramble up. They )Tj
T*(do not go far from the nest, return to it at night, and take some weeks to )Tj
T*(completely leave the nest. Many fledglings are found on the ground and in low )Tj
T*(shrubs during this period, where they continue to be cared for until they can )Tj
T*(make their way up into the trees. These birds are often mistakenly "rescued". )Tj
T*(The fledglings seek out siblings if separated, and huddle together for up to )Tj
T*(three weeks after fledging. )Tj
T*( The Noisy Miner has some of the largest group sizes of any communally breeding )Tj
T*(bird, with up to twenty males and one female attending a single brood.[58] Only )Tj
T*(males help with a nest, and while many birds may be associated with a )Tj
T*(particular brood, some males devote all their time to a single nest, while )Tj
T*(others spread their helping efforts across five or six nests.[53] Behavioural )Tj
T*(evidence and genetic testing indicate that helpers are male offspring of the )Tj
T*(breeding pair, or full siblings of the male parent.[53] Males nearly always )Tj
T*(bring food to the nestling singly, and if several arrive at once one will pass )Tj
T*(food to a nestling while the others wait. The female leaves the nest quickly )Tj
T*(when a male bird arrives, and never takes food from one of the helpers. )Tj
T*(Communal feeding of the young increases after fledging, and the young beg for )Tj
T*(food with constant â€˜chip chipâ€™ calls and gaping mouths. The female rarely feeds )Tj
T*(the young birds after they have fledged. )Tj
T*( [edit] Nest predation )Tj
T*( Cooperative breeding has been described as a strategy for decreasing nest )Tj
T*(predation,[59] although one study found no relationship between the number of )Tj
T*(helpers visiting a nest site and its success or failure. Noisy Miners were seen )Tj
T*(to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including )Tj
T*(multiple broods, laying eggs early in the season, nesting low in the canopy and )Tj
T*(group mobbing of predators; these measures did not guarantee against nest )Tj
T*(failure due to the diversity of potential predators in the Noisy Miner's open )Tj
T*(woodland habitat.[60] )Tj

T*( [edit] Conservation status )Tj
T*( Being abundant throughout its significant range, the Noisy Miner is considered )Tj
T*(of Least Concern for conservation,[1] and its extreme population densities in )Tj
T*(some areas actually constitute a threat to other species. The strong )Tj
T*(correlation between the presence of Noisy Miners and the absence of avian )Tj
T*(diversity has been well documented.[61] The role played by the Noisy Miner in )Tj
T*(the steep decline of many woodland birds, its impact on endangered species with )Tj
T*(similar foraging requirements, and the level of leaf damage leading to die-back )Tj
T*(that accompanies the exclusion of insectivorous birds from remnant woodlands, )Tj
T*(means that any strategy to restore avian diversity will need to take account of )Tj
T*(the management of Noisy Miner populations.[62] Some habitat restoration and )Tj
T*(revegetation projects have inadvertently increased the problem of the Noisy )Tj
T*(Miner by establishing the open eucalypt habit that they prefer. A focus of many )Tj
T*(regeneration projects has been the establishing of habitat corridors that )Tj
T*(connect patches of remnant forest, and the use of Eucalypts as fast-growing )Tj
T*(nurse species. Both practices have sound ecological value, but allow the Noisy )Tj
T*(Miner to proliferate, so conservation efforts are being modified by planting a )Tj
T*(shrubby understory with the eucalypts, and avoiding the creation of narrow )Tj
T*(protrusions, corners or clumps of trees in vegetation corridors.[34][63] A )Tj
T*(field study conducted in the Southern Highlands found that Noisy Miners tended )Tj
T*(to avoid areas dominated by wattles, species of which in the study area had )Tj
T*(bipinnate leaves. Hence the authors proposed revegetation projects include at )Tj
T*(least 15% Acacia species with bipinnate leaves if possible, as well as shrubby )Tj
T*(understory plants.[64] )Tj
T*( Translocation of Noisy Miners is unlikely to be a solution to their )Tj
T*(overabundance in remnant habitats. In a Victorian study where birds were banded )Tj
T*(and relocated, colonies moved into the now unpopulated area but soon returned )Tj
T*(to their original territories. The translocated birds did not settle in a new )Tj
T*(territory. They were not assimilated into resident populations of miners, but )Tj
T*(instead wandered up to 4.2 kilometres \(2.6Â mi\) from the release point, moving )Tj
T*(through apparently suitable habitat occupied by other minersâ€”at least for the )Tj
T*(first 50Â days following translocation. Two birds with radio tracking devices )Tj
T*(travelled 18 kilometres \(11Â mi\) back to their site of capture.[65] Although )Tj
T*(Noisy Miners are protected across Australia, and a permit is required to cull )Tj
T*(them, culling has been proposed as the most humane and practical method of )Tj
T*(reducing their impact, particularly where combined with rehabilitation of the )Tj
T*(habitat to suit a wider variety of bird life.[62] An unsanctioned cull took )Tj
T*(place on private rural property over 1991 and 1992, which reportedly resulted )Tj
T*(in an increase in species diversity.[66] )Tj

T*( Sir Henry Joseph Wood, CH \(3 March 1869Â â€“ 19 August 1944\) was an English )Tj
T*(conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of )Tj
T*(promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a )Tj
T*(century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his )Tj
T*(death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the "Henry Wood )Tj
T*(Promenade Concerts", although they continued to be generally referred to as )Tj
T*("the Proms". )Tj
T*( Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, )Tj
T*(Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy )Tj
T*(of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and )Tj
T*(became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera )Tj
T*(companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor )Tj
T*(of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl )Tj
T*(Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the )Tj
T*(British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. )Tj
T*( From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was )Tj
T*(engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade )Tj
T*(concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music )Tj
T*(at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade )Tj
T*(series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire )Tj
T*(entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in )Tj

T*(Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals )Tj
T*(throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal )Tj
T*(Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain )Tj
T*(over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, )Tj
T*(and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of )Tj
T*(the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries. )Tj
T*( [edit] Biography )Tj
T*( [edit] Early years )Tj
T*( Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood )Tj
T*(and his wife Martha, nÃ©e Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's )Tj
T*(pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a )Tj
T*(jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model )Tj
T*(engines.[1] It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and )Tj
T*(sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as )Tj
T*("the musicians' church".[n 1] His wife played the piano and sang songs from her )Tj
T*(native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a )Tj
T*(Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons.[3] The young Wood also )Tj
T*(learned to play the violin and viola.[4] )Tj
T*( Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply )Tj
T*(stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him )Tj
T*(into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument.[5] Cooper )Tj
T*(died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's )Tj
T*(successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard.[4] At the age of )Tj
T*(ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid )Tj
T*(appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.[n )Tj
T*(2] In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his )Tj
T*(father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a )Tj
T*(good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition )Tj
T*(building over the next three months.[7] At this time in his life, painting was )Tj
T*(nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the )Tj
T*(Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.[n 3] )Tj
T*( After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood )Tj
T*(entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony )Tj
T*(and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter )Tj
T*(Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia's singing )Tj
T*(class,[n 4] but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly )Tj
T*(influenced by Garcia.[10] Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by )Tj
T*(Garcia's son Gustave.[11] Wood's ambition at the time was to become a teacher )Tj
T*(of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the )Tj
T*(classes of as many singing teachers as he could,[10] although by his own )Tj
T*(account, "I possess a terrible voice. Garcia said it would go through a brick )Tj
T*(wall. In fact, a real conductor's voice."[12] )Tj
T*( On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately )Tj
T*(and was soon very successful, attracting "more singing pupils than I could )Tj
T*(comfortably deal with"[13] at half a guinea an hour.[n 5] He also worked as a )Tj
T*(rÃ©pÃ©titeur. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for Richard )Tj
T*(D'Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of The Yeomen of )Tj
T*(the Guard at the Savoy Theatre in 1888.[14] His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts )Tj
T*(this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur )Tj
T*(Sullivan about the score.[15] Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as "vivacious in )Tj
T*(style but factually unreliable".[16] )Tj
T*( It is certain, however, that Wood was rÃ©pÃ©titeur at Carte's Royal English )Tj
T*(Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe in late 1890 and early 1891, and )Tj
T*(for AndrÃ© Messager's La Basoche in 1891â€“92.[17] He also worked for Carte at the )Tj
T*(Savoy as assistant to FranÃ§ois Cellier on The Nautch Girl in 1891.[17] Wood )Tj
T*(remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his )Tj
T*(concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles.[18] During this )Tj
T*(period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an )Tj
T*(oratorio, St. Dorothea \(1889\), a light opera, Daisy \(1890\), and a one-act comic )Tj
T*(opera, Returning the Compliment \(1890\).[17] )Tj

T*( Wood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a )Tj
T*(choral concert in December 1887. Ad hoc engagements of this kind were )Tj
T*(commonplace for organists, but they brought little prestige such as was given )Tj
T*(to British conductor-composers such as Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and )Tj
T*(Alexander Mackenzie, or the rising generation of German star conductors led by )Tj
T*(Hans Richter and Arthur Nikisch.[19] His first sustained work as a conductor )Tj
T*(was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble, )Tj
T*(the Arthur Rouseby English Touring Opera. The company was not of a high )Tj
T*(standard, with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at )Tj
T*(each tour venue. Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract,[20] )Tj
T*(and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as )Tj
T*(conductor for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1891. For that company he )Tj
T*(conducted Carmen, The Bohemian Girl, The Daughter of the Regiment, Maritana, )Tj
T*(and Il trovatore.[21] This appointment was followed by a similar engagement )Tj
T*(with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers.[22] )Tj
T*( When Signor Lago, formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. )Tj
T*(Petersburg, was looking for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a )Tj
T*(proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood.[23] The season opened at the )Tj
T*(newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting )Tj
T*(the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin.[24] At that time the )Tj
T*(operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who )Tj
T*(chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews.[n 6] The work was not )Tj
T*(popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, )Tj
T*(leaving the company unpaid.[26] Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted )Tj
T*(performances of Maritana and rehearsed Oberon and Der FreischÃ¼tz.[17] After the )Tj
T*(collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing )Tj
T*(tuition. With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896, Wood's )Tj
T*(subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early years of the Proms )Tj
T*( In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the )Tj
T*(conductor Felix Mottl,[8] who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and )Tj
T*(chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall )Tj
T*(in London.[28] The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a )Tj
T*(ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to )Tj
T*(conduct.[28] There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under )Tj
T*(conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan.[29] Sullivan's )Tj
T*(concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his )Tj
T*(audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major )Tj
T*(classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more )Tj
T*(expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others.[30] Newman )Tj
T*(aimed to do the same: "I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public )Tj
T*(by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have )Tj
T*(created a public for classical and modern music."[31] )Tj
T*( Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone )Tj
T*(led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at )Tj
T*(the Proms until 1971.[32] Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall )Tj
T*(throughout the concerts, not only during intervals.[33] Prices were )Tj
T*(considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the )Tj
T*(promenade \(the standing area\) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and )Tj
T*(the grand circle \(reserved seats\) three and five shillings.[34][n 7] )Tj
T*( Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George )Tj
T*(Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on )Tj
T*(two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of )Tj
T*(the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason )Tj
T*(normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on )Tj
T*(the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.[35] )Tj
T*(Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher, agreed.[36] As members of )Tj
T*(Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched )Tj
T*(instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. )Tj
T*(After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently )Tj

T*(adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.[35] )Tj
T*( On 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts took )Tj
T*(place. Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer Agnes )Tj
T*(Nicholls:[37] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain )Tj
T*(at the end of the platform â€“ watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, )Tj
T*(he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National )Tj
T*(AnthemÂ ... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi )Tj
T*(Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The rest of the programme comprised, in the words of an historian of the )Tj
T*(Proms, David Cox, "for the most partÂ ... blatant trivialities."[38] Within )Tj
T*(days, however, Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream )Tj
T*(classical works, with Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and further excerpts from )Tj
T*(Wagner operas.[39] Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first )Tj
T*(season were Schubert's Great C Major, Mendelssohn's Italian and Schumann's )Tj
T*(Fourth. The concertos included Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and Schumann's )Tj
T*(Piano Concerto.[40] During the season Wood presented 23Â novelties, including )Tj
T*(the London premieres of pieces by Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, )Tj
T*(Massenet and Rimsky-Korsakov.[41] Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote )Tj
T*(every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night )Tj
T*(to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.[42] )Tj
T*( The income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time. Wood had )Tj
T*(nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts.[43] To gain )Tj
T*(the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his )Tj
T*(conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought )Tj
T*(sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed )Tj
T*(instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive )Tj
T*(conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that "if you watched him, you )Tj
T*(couldn't come in wrong."[44] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, "You may be )Tj
T*(reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in )Tj
T*(front of you".[45] Thirty-five years after Wood's death, AndrÃ© Previn recounted )Tj
T*(a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood "had everything planned )Tj
T*(out and timed to the minute ... at 10Â a.m. precisely his baton went down. You )Tj
T*(learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time."[46] )Tj
T*( Another feature of Wood's conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning; )Tj
T*(before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member )Tj
T*(of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork.[47] He persisted in )Tj
T*(this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra )Tj
T*(persuaded him that it was no longer necessary.[48] To improve ensemble, Wood )Tj
T*(experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have )Tj
T*(the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to )Tj
T*(his right, a layout that has since become common.[49] )Tj
T*( Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last )Tj
T*(work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the )Tj
T*(Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to )Tj
T*(prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August.[50] )Tj
T*(The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of )Tj
T*(Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a )Tj
T*(financial success, and were not repeated in later years.[51] In January 1897 )Tj
T*(Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon )Tj
T*(symphony concerts.[16] He continually presented new works by composers of many )Tj
T*(nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. )Tj
T*(Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, "I have never heard a finer performance in )Tj
T*(England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last )Tj
T*(Wednesday".[52] Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one )Tj
T*(of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience.[53] Wood )Tj
T*(also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not )Tj
T*(capable of conducting Wagner.[54] When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra )Tj

T*(performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky )Tj
T*(and Wagner for the programme.[16] Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, )Tj
T*(took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, "Tell me, Mr Wood, are you )Tj
T*(quite English?"[55] )Tj
T*( In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcÃ©e a )Tj
T*(few months his senior.[n 8] Jacobs describes it as "a marriage of perfect )Tj
T*(professional and private harmony".[56] As a singer, with Wood as her )Tj
T*(accompanist, she won praise from the critics.[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early 20th century )Tj
T*( The promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s, but in 1902 Newman, who )Tj
T*(had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations, found himself unable )Tj
T*(to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen's Hall Orchestra and was )Tj
T*(declared bankrupt. The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir )Tj
T*(Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, )Tj
T*(retained Newman as manager of the concerts, and encouraged him and Wood to )Tj
T*(continue with their project of improving the public's taste.[58] At the )Tj
T*(beginning of 1902, Wood accepted the conductorship of that year's Sheffield )Tj
T*(triennial festival. He continued to be associated with that festival until )Tj
T*(1936, changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces. A German critic, )Tj
T*(reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication, wrote, "Two personalities now )Tj
T*(represent a new epoch in English musical life â€“ Edward Elgar as composer, and )Tj
T*(Henry J. Wood as conductor."[59] Later in the year, overtaxed by his enormous )Tj
T*(workload, Wood's health broke down. Even though this was during the Proms )Tj
T*(season, Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of )Tj
T*(scene. Leaving the leader of the orchestra, Arthur Payne, to conduct during his )Tj
T*(absence, Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco, missing the Proms concerts )Tj
T*(from 13 October to 8 November.[60] )Tj
T*( In the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals )Tj
T*(that Wood was neglecting British music.[61] In 1899 Newman unsuccessfully )Tj
T*(attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar's Enigma Variations,[62] but )Tj
T*(in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of )Tj
T*(Delius to London concertgoers.[63] By the end of the first decade of the new )Tj
T*(century, however, Wood's reputation in conducting British music was in no )Tj
T*(doubt; he gave the world, British or London premieres of more than a hundred )Tj
T*(British works between 1900 and 1910.[60][64] Meanwhile, he introduced his )Tj
T*(audiences to many European composers. In the 1903 season, he programmed )Tj
T*(symphonies by Bruckner \(No. 7\), Sibelius \(No. 1\), and Mahler \(No. 1\). In the )Tj
T*(same year, he introduced several of Richard Strauss's tone poems to London, and )Tj
T*(in 1905 he gave Strauss's Symphonia Domestica. This prompted the composer to )Tj
T*(write, "I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the )Tj
T*(splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood's master hand has created in such a short )Tj
T*(time."[65] )Tj
T*( Creating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a )Tj
T*(struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which )Tj
T*(orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a )Tj
T*(substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic )Tj
T*(Society described it thus: "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He )Tj
T*(sends B \(whom you don't mind\) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge )Tj
T*(or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the )Tj
T*(concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away."[66] )Tj
T*(After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar )Tj
T*(faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: )Tj
T*("Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning."[67] Forty )Tj
T*(players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony )Tj
T*(Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it )Tj
T*(was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra.[68] )Tj
T*( Wood had great sympathy for rank-and-file orchestral players and strove for )Tj
T*(improvements in their pay.[69] He sought to raise their status and was the )Tj
T*(first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to )Tj

T*(trombone or double bass, but they can play the violin, and they do."[71] By )Tj
T*(1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra.[72] )Tj
T*( Wood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time. He )Tj
T*(gave his Fantasia on Welsh Melodies and Fantasia on Scottish Melodies on )Tj
T*(successive nights in 1909. He composed the work for which he is most )Tj
T*(celebrated, Fantasia on British Sea Songs, for a concert in 1905, celebrating )Tj
T*(the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. It caught the public fancy )Tj
T*(immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with Handel's "See the )Tj
T*(Conquering Hero Comes" and Arne's "Rule, Britannia!". He played it at the Proms )Tj
T*(more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the "Last Night of the Proms", )Tj
T*(the lively concert marking the end of each season. It remained so under his )Tj
T*(successors, though often rearranged, notably by Sir Malcolm Sargent.[73][n 9] A )Tj
T*(highlight of the Fantasia is the hornpipe \("Jack's the Lad"\); Wood said of it: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(They stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe â€“ that is until I whip up the )Tj
T*(orchestra to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose stamping )Tj
T*(technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if )Tj
T*(possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good )Tj
T*(fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.[77])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Among Wood's other works was his Purcell Suite, incorporating themes from )Tj
T*(Purcell's stage works and string sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral )Tj
T*(festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range )Tj
T*(of composers from AlbÃ©niz to Vivaldi.[78] )Tj
T*( Wood worked with his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at )Tj
T*(her recitals. In 1906, at the Norwich music festival he presented Beethoven's )Tj
T*(Choral Symphony and Bach's St Matthew Passion, with his wife among the )Tj
T*(singers.[79] In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died.[80] )Tj
T*(Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss.[n 10] On his return, )Tj
T*(Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's )Tj
T*(death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in )Tj
T*(that art was greatly missed by the critics.[81] In June 1911, he married his )Tj
T*(secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex \(1882â€“1967\), with whom he had two )Tj
T*(daughters.[82] In the same year he accepted a knighthood,[83] and declined the )Tj
T*(conductorship of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Mahler, )Tj
T*(as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.[84] )Tj
T*( Throughout the early part of the century, Wood was influential in changing the )Tj
T*(habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at )Tj
T*(symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood )Tj
T*(discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed )Tj
T*(in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national )Tj
T*(press.[85] In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the )Tj
T*(Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and )Tj
T*(at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and )Tj
T*(Hull.[8] His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which )Tj
T*(listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the )Tj
T*(top ten were: Wagner \(121\); Beethoven \(34\); Tchaikovsky \(30\); Mozart \(28\); )Tj
T*(DvoÅ™Ã¡k \(16\); Weber \(16\); J.S. Bach \(14\); Brahms \(14\); Elgar \(14\); and Liszt )Tj
T*(\(13\).[86] )Tj
T*( The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of )Tj
T*(this part of Wood's career. Among those conducting their own works or hearing )Tj
T*(Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff and )Tj
T*(Schoenberg.[9] Rehearsing Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra, Wood urged )Tj
T*(his players, "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to )Tj
T*(play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote: "It is not often that )Tj
T*(an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the )Tj
T*(people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the )Tj
T*(performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the )Tj

T*(seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not )Tj
T*(look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London."[87] The composer )Tj
T*(was delighted with the performance and congratulated Wood and the orchestra )Tj
T*(warmly: "I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such )Tj
T*(music played again as a musician of culture demands."[88] Wood programmed the )Tj
T*(work again in 1914, when it was much more warmly received.[88] )Tj
T*( [edit] First World War and post-war )Tj
T*( On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer )Tj
T*(discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned. They had by this time )Tj
T*(become an established institution,[n 11] and it was agreed to go ahead. )Tj
T*(However, anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge )Tj
T*(in the U.S., and there was a campaign to ban all German music from )Tj
T*(concerts.[90] Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be )Tj
T*(played as planned: "The greatest examples of Music and Art are world )Tj
T*(possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the )Tj
T*(hour."[91] When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell's took on )Tj
T*(the responsibility for the Queen's Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued )Tj
T*(throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although )Tj
T*(there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by BartÃ³k, Stravinsky and )Tj
T*(Debussy. An historian of the Proms, AteÅŸ Orga, wrote, "Concerts often had to be )Tj
T*(re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids. Falling bombs, )Tj
T*(shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever )Tj
T*(threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real )Tj
T*(part to play in boosting morale."[92] )Tj
T*( Towards the end of the war, Wood received an offer by which he was seriously )Tj
T*(tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical )Tj
T*(director.[93] He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York )Tj
T*(Philharmonic Orchestras,[94] but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest )Tj
T*(in the world.[17] Nonetheless, as he told Boult, "it was hard to refuse, but I )Tj
T*(felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present )Tj
T*(moment."[95] )Tj
T*( After the war, the Proms continued much as before. The second halves of )Tj
T*(concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical )Tj
T*(music. Chappell's, having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent Â£35,000 )Tj
T*(keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs )Tj
T*(published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less )Tj
T*(enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of )Tj
T*(which were not profitable.[96] )Tj
T*( In 1921 Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the )Tj
T*(first English conductor to receive the honour.[n 12] By now he was beginning to )Tj
T*(find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising )Tj
T*(younger rivals. Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure )Tj
T*(since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided )Tj
T*(mention of the other in his memoirs.[98] Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's )Tj
T*(recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, )Tj
T*(always admired and respected Wood.[99] Other younger conductors included men )Tj
T*(who had been members of Wood's orchestra, including Basil Cameron and Eugene )Tj
T*(Goossens.[100] Another protÃ©gÃ© of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who appeared at the )Tj
T*(Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922.[101] Wood encouraged him to )Tj
T*(abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on )Tj
T*(conducting.[102] Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by )Tj
T*(taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of )Tj
T*(Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next )Tj
T*(twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur )Tj
T*(Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to )Tj
T*(rehearse and conduct its concerts.[103] )Tj
T*( In 1925 Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the Los Angeles )Tj
T*(Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. Such was their success, both )Tj
T*(artistic and financial, that Wood was invited back, and conducted again the )Tj

T*(conducted there in 1934.[104] )Tj
T*( [edit] BBC and the Proms )Tj
T*( On his return to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood found himself in )Tj
T*(the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell's, William Boosey, and )Tj
T*(the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of )Tj
T*(music, fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts. He attempted to )Tj
T*(prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen's Hall from broadcasting for )Tj
T*(the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the )Tj
T*(Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, )Tj
T*(Boosey announced that Chappell's would no longer support concerts at the )Tj
T*(Queen's Hall.[105] The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue )Tj
T*(caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC's )Tj
T*(announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also )Tj
T*(run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen's Hall.[106] )Tj
T*( The BBC regime brought immediate benefits. The use of the second half of )Tj
T*(concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for )Tj
T*(its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in )Tj
T*(the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from )Tj
T*(Chappell's.[107] For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice )Tj
T*(as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily )Tj
T*(rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed.[108] He was also allowed extra )Tj
T*(players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the )Tj
T*(work for the forces available.[108] )Tj
T*( In 1929, Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics. )Tj
T*("I got very fed up with them, always finding fault with any arrangement or )Tj
T*(orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.",[109] and so )Tj
T*(Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, )Tj
T*(as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky.[n 13] In Wood's )Tj
T*(later account, the press and the BBC "fell into the trap and said the scoring )Tj
T*(was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare [sic] for true colour etc. â€“ and )Tj
T*(performance after performance was given and asked for."[109] Wood kept the )Tj
T*(secret for five years before revealing the truth.[111] The press treated the )Tj
T*(deception as a great joke; The Times entered into the spirit of it with a )Tj
T*(jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.[112][n 14] )Tj
T*( As Wood's working life took a turn for the better, his domestic life started )Tj
T*(to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became )Tj
T*(estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most )Tj
T*(of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad.[n 15] She refused to )Tj
T*(divorce him.[115] The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his )Tj
T*(estrangement from their daughters.[116] In 1934 he began a happy relationship )Tj
T*(with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in )Tj
T*(the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players )Tj
T*(recalled, "She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie )Tj
T*(got him a new evening suit, instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished )Tj
T*(yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human."[46] As Wood was not free to )Tj
T*(remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to "Lady Jessie Wood" and was )Tj
T*(generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife.[117] In his memoirs, Wood )Tj
T*(mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent )Tj
T*(relationship.[117][118] )Tj
T*( In his later years, Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with )Tj
T*(the year-round concert season. Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC )Tj
T*(in 1930. In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct )Tj
T*(a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season.[119] The BBC )Tj
T*(chose Wood for important collaborations with BartÃ³k and Paul Hindemith,[n 16] )Tj
T*(and for the first British performance of Mahler's vast Symphony No. 8.[103] But )Tj
T*(Jacobs notes that, in the general concert repertory, Wood now had to compete )Tj
T*(against well-known foreign conductors such as Bruno Walter, Willem Mengelberg, )Tj
T*(and Arturo Toscanini, "in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a )Tj
T*(workhorse".[103] )Tj

T*( [edit] Last years )Tj
T*( In 1936, Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival. The choral works )Tj
T*(he conducted included the Verdi Requiem, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Berlioz' )Tj
T*(Te Deum, Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and, in the presence of the composer, )Tj
T*(Rachmaninoff's The Bells.[122] The following year, Wood began planning for a )Tj
T*(grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor. The Royal Albert Hall )Tj
T*(was chosen as the venue, having a far larger capacity than the Queen's Hall. )Tj
T*(The concert was given on 5 October 1938. Rachmaninoff played the solo part in )Tj
T*(his Second Piano Concerto, and Vaughan Williams, at Wood's request, composed a )Tj
T*(short choral work for the occasion: the Serenade to Music for orchestra and 16 )Tj
T*(soloists. The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan, )Tj
T*(Beethoven, Bach, Bax, Wagner, Handel and Elgar. The orchestra comprised players )Tj
T*(from the three London orchestras: the London Symphony, London Philharmonic and )Tj
T*(BBC Symphony Orchestras. The concert raised Â£9,000 for Wood's chosen charity, )Tj
T*(providing health care for musicians.[123] In the same year, Wood published his )Tj
T*(autobiography, My Life of Music.[103] )Tj
T*( On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the BBC immediately )Tj
T*(put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away )Tj
T*(from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing. Its musical )Tj
T*(activities, including the orchestra, moved to Bristol.[124] The BBC withdrew )Tj
T*(not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined )Tj
T*(that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic )Tj
T*(Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week )Tj
T*(season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The season was curtailed )Tj
T*(after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen's Hall to close.[125] )Tj
T*(The last Prom given at the Queen's Hall was on 7Â September 1940. In May 1941, )Tj
T*(the hall was destroyed by bombs.[126] )Tj
T*( It was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the )Tj
T*(Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, )Tj
T*(but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the )Tj
T*(home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate )Tj
T*(conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the )Tj
T*(task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in )Tj
T*(1964.[127] The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed )Tj
T*(its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate )Tj
T*(conductor during that season.[128] In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, )Tj
T*(and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was )Tj
T*(ordered to have a month in bed.[129] Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 )Tj
T*(season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 â€“ )Tj
T*(many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.[130] )Tj
T*( Despite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel, Wood insisted on going )Tj
T*(to provincial cities to conduct â€“ as much, according to Jacobs, to help the )Tj
T*(local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences.[103] His final season was in )Tj
T*(1944. The season began well with Wood in good form, but after three weeks raids )Tj
T*(by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the )Tj
T*(closure of places of entertainment.[131] The Proms were immediately relocated )Tj
T*(to Bedford some 50 miles \(80Â km\) away, where Wood continued to conduct. He was )Tj
T*(taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary )Tj
T*(Prom on 10Â August; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its )Tj
T*(broadcast. Wood died just over a week later on 19Â August at Hitchin Hospital in )Tj
T*(Hitchin, Hertfordshire;[132] his funeral service was held in the town at St )Tj
T*(Mary's church,[133] and his ashes were interred in the Musicians' Chapel of St )Tj
T*(Sepulchre-without-Newgate.[134] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recordings )Tj
T*( Wood's recording career began in 1908, when he accompanied his wife Olga in )Tj
T*("Farewell, forests" by Tchaikovsky, for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, )Tj
T*(better known as His Master's Voice or HMV. They made eight other records )Tj
T*(together for HMV over the next two years.[135] After Olga's death, Wood signed )Tj
T*(a contract with HMV's rival, Columbia, for whom he made a series of discs )Tj
T*(between 1915 and 1917 with the singer Clara Butt, including excerpts from )Tj

T*(Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius.[136] Between 1915 and 1925 he conducted 65 )Tj
T*(recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process, including )Tj
T*(many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar's Violin )Tj
T*(Concerto with Albert Sammons as soloist.[137] When the microphone and )Tj
T*(electrical recording were introduced in 1925, Wood re-recorded the Elgar )Tj
T*(concerto, with Sammons, and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine )Tj
T*(years.[138] The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on )Tj
T*(compact disc and is well regarded by some critics.[n 17] )Tj
T*( Wood was wooed from Columbia by the young Decca company in 1935. For Decca he )Tj
T*(conducted 23 recordings over the next two years, including Beethoven's Fifth )Tj
T*(Symphony, Elgar's Enigma Variations and Vaughan Williams's A London )Tj
T*(Symphony.[140] In 1938 he returned to Columbia, for whom his five new )Tj
T*(recordings included the Serenade to Music with the 16 original singers, a few )Tj
T*(days after the premiere, and his own Fantasia on British Sea Songs.[141] )Tj
T*( Wood's recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death. The )Tj
T*(Record Guide, 1956, lists none of his records.[142] A few of his recordings )Tj
T*(have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and )Tj
T*(Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.[143] )Tj
T*( [edit] Premieres )Tj
T*( In Jacobs's 1994 biography, the list of premieres conducted by Wood extends to )Tj

T*( [edit] Honours, memorials and reputation )Tj
T*( In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his )Tj
T*(appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown )Tj
T*(\(Belgium; 1920\), and Officer of the Legion of Honour \(France; 1926\). He )Tj
T*(received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of )Tj
T*(both the Royal Academy of Music \(1920\) and the Royal College of Music )Tj
T*(\(1923\).[145] )Tj
T*( Jacobs lists 26Â compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the )Tj
T*(Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel DuprÃ©, )Tj
T*(and William Walton.[145] The poet laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of )Tj
T*(six verses in his honour, entitled "Sir Henry Wood", often referred to by its )Tj
T*(first line, "Where does the uttered music go?". Walton set it to music as an )Tj
T*(anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26Â April 1946 at )Tj
T*(St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial )Tj

T*( Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated )Tj
T*(Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and )Tj

T*(students.[8] The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill )Tj
T*(campus after him.[149] His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially "the )Tj
T*(Henry Wood Promenade Concerts",[150] but universally referred to by the )Tj
T*(informal short version.[n 18] )Tj
T*( His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him "Timber" â€“ more than a play )Tj
T*(on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too. His tally of )Tj
T*(first performances, or first performances in Britain, was heroic: at least 717Â )Tj
T*(works by 357Â composers. Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not )Tj
T*(be his, particularly in his limited legacy of recordings, but he remains one of )Tj
T*(the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced.[16])Tj

T*( Notes)Tj
T*(  )Tj
T*( ^ According to Wood, his father was urged to become a professional singer by )Tj
T*(the conductor Sir Michael Costa and others.[2])Tj
T*(^ Two shillings and sixpence: in decimal coinage, 12Â½ pence. In terms of )Tj
T*(average earnings, this equates to more than Â£65 in current values.[6])Tj
T*(^ In 1911 Wood gave an exhibition of fifty sketches in oil at the Piccadilly )Tj
T*(Arcade Gallery, raising Â£200 in aid of the Queen's Hall Orchestra Endowment )Tj
T*(Fund.[8][9])Tj
T*(^ Wood \(p. 29\) lists Garcia as among his professors, but Jacobs \(p. 13\) notes )Tj
T*(that Wood's name does not appear among the choir lists in which Garcia's pupils )Tj
T*(all appeared.)Tj
T*(^ Ten shillings and sixpence: 52Â½ pence in decimal terms; in 2009 values )Tj
T*(somewhere between Â£40 \(based on retail prices\) and Â£275 \(based on average )Tj

T*(when recalling it in his memoirs.)Tj
T*(^ George Bernard Shaw, in a long review in The World, commented on all the )Tj
T*(principal singers, the costumes, scenery and choreography, but did not mention )Tj
T*(the conductor.[25])Tj
T*(^ In decimal coinage, respectively 5, 10, 15 and 25 pence: the equivalent of )Tj
T*(approximately Â£4 to Â£20 in terms of 2009 retail prices. Tickets for formal )Tj
T*(symphony concerts at the time cost up to five times as much.[6])Tj
T*(^ In his memoirs Wood refers to her as "Princess Olga Ouroussoff", but )Tj
T*(according to Jacobs \(p. 59\) she was entitled to neither the rank nor the )Tj
T*(surname, although her mother was Princess Sofiya Urusova)Tj
T*(^ In 2002 and 2003, the Fantasia was performed "with additional Songs arranged )Tj
T*(by John Wilson, Stephen Jackson \(chorusmaster of the BBC Symphony Orchestra\) )Tj
T*(and Percy Grainger";[74] in 2004 "with additional Songs arranged by Stephen )Tj

T*(^ In his memoirs, Wood does not say where or for how long.)Tj
T*(^ Although Wood himself did not generally use the term "the Proms", it was )Tj
T*(common currency by now even in the more formal newspapers. It was used in The )Tj
T*(Observer and The Musical Times in 1912. The Times and The Manchester Guardian )Tj
T*(used the term from 1918 and 1923 respectively.[89] Even Wood used the term when )Tj
T*(referring to the Last Night of the Proms, which he called "the Last Prom of the )Tj
T*(Season".[77])Tj
T*(^ Wood was only the second conductor of any nationality to receive the honour, )Tj
T*(the first being Hans von BÃ¼low in 1873. Wood received the award four years )Tj

T*( Sarah Trimmer \(nÃ©e Kirby; 6Â January 1741 â€“ 15Â December 1810\) was a writer and )Tj
T*(critic of 18th-century British children's literature, as well as an educational )Tj
T*(reformer. Her periodical, The Guardian of Education, helped to define the )Tj
T*(emerging genre by seriously reviewing children's literature for the first time; )Tj
T*(it also provided the first history of children's literature, establishing a )Tj
T*(canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. )Tj
T*(Trimmer's most popular children's book, Fabulous Histories, inspired numerous )Tj
T*(children's animal stories and remained in print for over a century. )Tj
T*( Trimmer was also an active philanthropist. She founded several Sunday schools )Tj
T*(and charity schools in her parish. To further these educational projects, she )Tj
T*(wrote textbooks and manuals for women interested in starting their own schools. )Tj
T*(Trimmer's efforts inspired other women, such as Hannah More, to establish )Tj
T*(Sunday school programs and to write for children and the poor. )Tj
T*( Trimmer's works are dedicated to maintaining many aspects of the social and )Tj
T*(political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting )Tj
T*(the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor )Tj
T*(the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social )Tj
T*(hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. )Tj
T*(Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies )Tj
T*(of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and )Tj
T*(the family. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Sarah Trimmer was born on January 6, 1741, in Ipswich to John Joshua Kirby and )Tj
T*(Sarah \(nÃ©e Bell\); her father was a noted artist and served as President of the )Tj
T*(Society of Artists. Trimmer had one younger brother, William; she was )Tj
T*(apparently the better writer, for she would sometimes compose his school essays )Tj
T*(for him.[1] As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justinerâ€™s boarding school )Tj
T*(in Ipswich, an experience she always remembered fondly.[2] In 1755, the family )Tj
T*(moved to London when her father, who had written several important works on )Tj
T*(perspective, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales.[3] Because )Tj
T*(of her father's connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to )Tj
T*(meet the painters William Hogarth and Thomas Gainsborough as well as the )Tj
T*(by-then legendary writer and critic Samuel Johnson. She made a favourable )Tj
T*(impression on Johnson when she immediately produced her pocket copy of John )Tj
T*(Milton's Paradise Lost \(1667\) to help settle a dispute between her father and )Tj
T*(Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton )Tj
T*(enough to carry his works with her at all times, "subsequently invited her to )Tj
T*(his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical The )Tj
T*(Rambler".[4] In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil the Prince of Wales )Tj
T*(\(soon to be George III\), her father was made Clerk of the Works to the Royal )Tj
T*(Household at Kew Palace and the family moved to Kew.[5] There she met James )Tj
T*(Trimmer, whom she married on 21 September 1762; after their marriage, the )Tj
T*(couple moved to Old Brentford.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Motherhood and philanthropy )Tj
T*( Trimmer was close to her parents; after her marriage, she walked to visit her )Tj
T*(father every day, later accompanied by her eldest children. She and her husband )Tj
T*(had 12 children in allâ€”six boys and six girls. Trimmer was responsible for her )Tj
T*(children's education and it was the combination of her duties as a mother and a )Tj
T*(teacher that initially sparked her interest in education.[7] )Tj
T*( Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer also became active in the Sunday school )Tj
T*(movement, founding the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford )Tj

T*(in 1786. She and two of the ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and )Tj
T*(Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the )Tj
T*(poor children of the neighborhood.[8] Initially, five hundred boys and girls )Tj
T*(wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, )Tj
T*(she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family )Tj
T*(to one pupil.[8] The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty )Tj
T*(studentsâ€”one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls.[8] While )Tj
T*(some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft )Tj
T*(argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical )Tj
T*(changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately.[9] The students were )Tj
T*(taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students )Tj
T*(were also encouraged to keep cleanâ€”"a present of a brush and comb was given to )Tj
T*(all who desired them".[10] Trimmer's schools became so well known and admired )Tj
T*(that Raikes, Trimmer's initial inspiration, recommended those who needed )Tj
T*(assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte )Tj
T*(asked Trimmer's advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.[11] )Tj
T*( After her visit to the queen, Trimmer was inspired to write The Å’conomy of )Tj
T*(Charity, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday )Tj
T*(schools in their own communities.[12] However, her book accomplished much more )Tj
T*(than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer )Tj
T*(claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the )Tj
T*(poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social )Tj
T*(upheaval they were trying to quell.[13] The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued )Tj
T*(the dire warning that "not only would education 'teach them to read seditious )Tj
T*(pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity'â€¦ but it would render )Tj
T*(them unfit for 'the laborious employment to which their rank in society had )Tj
T*(destined them'".[14] Trimmer agreed that the poor were "destined" by God to be )Tj
T*(poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. )Tj
T*(The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in )Tj
T*(publishing The Å’conomy of Charity, Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate. )Tj
T*( As scholar Deborah Wills has argued: "[The Å’conomy of Charity] is actually )Tj
T*(informed by a highly politicized subtext which anticipates, subverts, and )Tj
T*(counters anti-Sunday School arguments. [Trimmer] outlines a programme through )Tj
T*(which the Sunday School, when properly administered, can serve as a means of )Tj
T*(instituting social control and intensifying hierarchy. â€¦Trimmerâ€™s carefully )Tj
T*(modest and unassuming text is thus revealed as a middle-class manifesto for the )Tj
T*(appropriation of social, political, and religious power in the name of moral )Tj
T*(instruction."[13] )Tj
T*( For example, Trimmer contends that Sunday schools teach their pupils not )Tj
T*(merely to read the Bible but how to draw the proper theological and political )Tj
T*(conclusions from it.[15] Furthermore, Trimmer argues that the responsibility )Tj
T*(for educating the poor rests on the shoulders of the middle class alone. By )Tj
T*(eliminating the aristocracy from an active role in her philanthropic programs, )Tj
T*("Trimmer ensures that those who actually regulate the Sunday School curriculum )Tj
T*(are those who will both embody and perpetuate bourgeois cultureâ€.[16] As Wills )Tj
T*(points out, this distinguishes her from other philanthropists of the time such )Tj
T*(as Hannah More. )Tj
T*(â€œO Lord, I wish to promote thy holy religion which is dreadfully neglected. I )Tj
T*(am desirous to save young persons from the vices of the age.â€)Tj
T*(â€” Sarah Trimmer[17])Tj
T*( Trimmer also founded and oversaw charity schools in her neighborhood. She )Tj
T*(directed promising students from her Sunday schools, which met only once a )Tj
T*(week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in )Tj
T*(her journal, these schools seemed to her to "afford a happy prospect of )Tj
T*(rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy".[18] While the Sunday )Tj
T*(schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the )Tj
T*(parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the )Tj
T*(Propagation of Christian Knowledge \(SPCK\), which had funded the first charity )Tj
T*(schools around a century earlier.[19] Trimmer criticized the rote learning that )Tj
T*(went on in traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic )Tj

T*(catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask )Tj
T*(questions.[9] She wrote in her journal, â€œmy earnest desire is to compose a )Tj
T*(course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in )Tj
T*(reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught )Tj
T*(in the Scriptures".[20] Trimmer also established schools of industry to which )Tj
T*(she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for )Tj
T*(example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools )Tj
T*(would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, )Tj
T*(the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. )Tj
T*(Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.[19] )Tj
T*( Wilfried Keutsch, a modern scholar of the 18th century, has criticized )Tj
T*(Trimmer's projects as naive and moralistic: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*([There is] no indication that Sarah Trimmer based her many efforts to instruct )Tj
T*(and improve the children of the poor on detailed social analysis, but it is )Tj
T*(apparent that she was deeply disturbed not only by their needs but also about )Tj
T*(the increasing pauperization of the country. Whether she understood that )Tj
T*(society was changing from a more feudal to a more modern bourgeois structure, )Tj
T*(in which many of the stabilizing old personal ties were removed and replaced by )Tj
T*(the cash-nexus, is not clear. â€¦on the whole she displays no interest in the )Tj
T*(social and economic causes of poverty. Instead she offers a model of )Tj
T*(improvement which rests on a rigorous division of the working people and the )Tj
T*(poor into black and white: the deserving and the undeserving poor, the godly )Tj
T*(and the ungodly, the respectable and dutiful and the rebellious and undutiful, )Tj
T*(the idle and the industrious, that is, on an alternating identification of )Tj
T*(poverty with virtue and vice.[21])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Although Sunday schools such as the ones established by Trimmer have often )Tj
T*(been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle )Tj
T*(class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued )Tj
T*(that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many )Tj
T*(of the moral lessons forced upon them.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Literary career )Tj
T*( In a literary career that spanned more than a quarter of a century, Trimmer )Tj
T*(authored somewhere between 33[23] and 44 texts.[24] She wrote in a wide range )Tj
T*(of genres: textbooks, teaching manuals, children's literature, political )Tj
T*(pamphlets and critical periodicals. While many of her texts were for children, )Tj
T*(some of her works, such as The Å’conomy of Charity, were also for specific adult )Tj
T*(audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as The )Tj
T*(Servantâ€™s Friend \(1786â€“7\), which was meant to instruct servants of all )Tj
T*(ages.[23] )Tj
T*( Throughout her career, Trimmer worked with four different publishers â€” John )Tj
T*(Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, and Joseph Johnson â€” and, by 1800, she had )Tj
T*(the most works of any author in the Newbery catalogue, the catalogue that sold )Tj
T*(the most children's literature.[23] Eventually, Trimmer stopped publishing with )Tj
T*(Joseph Johnson, because she disagreed with his politicsâ€”he was a supporter of )Tj
T*(the French Revolution and was publishing works that she considered )Tj
T*(subversive.[25] )Tj
T*( [edit] An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature )Tj
T*( Trimmer's first book was An easy introduction to the knowledge of nature, and )Tj
T*(reading the holy scriptures, adapted to the capacities of children \(1780\), )Tj
T*(which built on the revolution in children's literature begun by Anna Laetitia )Tj
T*(Barbauld.[26] In the "Preface", Trimmer writes that Isaac Watts's Treatise on )Tj
T*(Education was the inspiration for the work and that "a book containing a kind )Tj
T*(of general survey of the works of Nature would be very useful, as a means to )Tj
T*(open the mind by gradual steps to the knowledge of the SUPREME BEING, )Tj
T*(preparatory to their reading the holy scriptures".[27] In the text, the reader )Tj
T*(follows a mother and her two children, Charlotte and Henry \(perhaps named after )Tj
T*(two of Trimmer's own children[28]\), on a series of nature walks during which )Tj
T*(the mother describes the wonders of God's creation. In 1793, a version of this )Tj

T*(book was added to the catalogue of the Society for the Propagation of Christian )Tj
T*(Knowledge; after 77 years, it had sold over 750,000 copies.[29] )Tj
T*( Aileen Fyfe, a historian interested in the relationship between science and )Tj
T*(religion, has argued that Trimmer's text, although inspired by Barbauld's )Tj
T*(books, differs dramatically from Barbauld's in its religious orientation. )Tj
T*(Barbauld was a Dissenter and more inclined, according to Fyfe, to "encourage )Tj
T*(curiosity, observation, and reasoning".[30] In contrast, Trimmer, as a high )Tj
T*(church Anglican, depicted nature as "awe-inspiring" and as a reflection not )Tj
T*(only of God's divinity but also of his goodness.[31] These beliefs are )Tj
T*(reflected even in the structure of the text; Trimmer's aim was to convey a )Tj
T*(sense of the awe, therefore her text does not progress in an orderly fashion )Tj
T*(through a study of the natural world. Barbauld's texts, however, emphasize the )Tj
T*(slow accumulation of knowledge as well as logical thinking. Thus Evenings at )Tj
T*(Home, which she co-wrote with her brother, John Aikin, has a "systematic )Tj
T*(structure".[32] Another difference between the two writers lies in the role of )Tj
T*(authority: whereas Barbauld's texts and those she wrote with her brother, )Tj
T*(emphasize dialogues between teacher and pupil, Trimmer's textual conversations, )Tj
T*(Fyfe notes, were "controlled by the parent".[30] )Tj
T*( However, Donelle Ruwe, a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, has )Tj
T*(pointed out that An Easy Introduction is not entirely a conservative textâ€”it )Tj
T*(challenges 18th-century notions of the proper roles for women laid out in )Tj
T*(conduct manuals such as those written by John Gregory and James Fordyce. The )Tj
T*(mother in Trimmer's text acts as a "spiritual leader" and demonstrates that a )Tj
T*(woman is capable of "theological reasoning".[29] Such depictions challenge )Tj
T*(Jean-Jacques Rousseau's claims that women are capable only of memorizing )Tj
T*(religious dogma and not of sophisticated reasoning. Furthermore, Trimmer's )Tj
T*(mother tries to educate her children in a straightforward manner instead of )Tj
T*(employing the "manipulative" tricks of the tutor in Rousseau's Emile.[29] )Tj
T*( A few years later, inspired by Madame de Genlis's AdÃ¨le et ThÃ©odore \(1782\), )Tj
T*(Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible for which she provided )Tj
T*(the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and )Tj
T*(British history. These various sets were very popular and could be purchased )Tj
T*(together \(commentary and prints\) or individually. The prints were usually hung )Tj
T*(on walls or bound into books.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Relations with John Marshall )Tj
T*( The childrenâ€™s publisher John Marshall &amp; Co. produced The footstep to Mrs. )Tj
T*(Trimmer's Sacred history: for the instruction and amusement of little children )Tj
T*(in 1785. Trimmer had always advocated the use of pictorial material in books )Tj
T*(for children,[34] and the publisher, who was experienced in producing cheap )Tj
T*(popular prints, was in a good position to publish them for her. In May 1786 )Tj
T*(Marshall published A series of prints of scripture history, â€œdesigned as )Tj
T*(ornaments for those apartments in which children receive the first rudiments of )Tj
T*(their education.â€ The prints were sold â€œpasted on boards, for hanging up in )Tj
T*(nurseriesâ€ at 1s 6d, in sheets for 8d, sewed in marbled paper â€˜for the pocket,â€™ )Tj
T*(for 10d. or else neatly bound in read leather at 1s 2d.[35] They were also )Tj
T*(published with an accompanying small book entitled, A description of a set of )Tj
T*(prints of scripture history, which was also available in different bindings. )Tj
T*(The venture proved to be successful and these two works were quickly followed )Tj
T*(by the publication of five similar â€˜Series of Printsâ€™ together with )Tj
T*(accompanying â€˜Descriptionsâ€™, compiled by Mrs Trimmer, on the subjects of )Tj
T*(Ancient history \(1786\), Roman history \(1789\), English history \(1789\), the New )Tj
T*(Testament \(1790\) and the Old Testament \(1797\). These were hugely popular and )Tj
T*(were reprinted by the Marshalls and their successors at regular intervals over )Tj
T*(the next thirty years. )Tj
T*( In January \(1788\) Mrs Trimmer and John Marshall announced a new joint venture, )Tj
T*(The family magazine; or a repository of religious instruction and rational )Tj
T*(amusement. It was a monthly periodical â€œdesigned to counteract the pernicious )Tj
T*(tendency of immoral books &amp;c. which have circulated of late years among the )Tj
T*(inferior classes of people,â€[36] and usually included one engraved plate. The )Tj
T*(content consisted of â€˜religious tales for Sunday eveningsâ€™ and â€˜moral tales for )Tj

T*(in England possess privileges, and enjoy many comforts, which persons of their )Tj

T*(included, 'in order to check the practice of cruelty to brute creation.' The )Tj
T*(final section of the magazine contained 'a selection of Ballads, Songs &amp;c., )Tj

T*(content, this publication introduced many of the ideas which would later bear )Tj
T*(fruit in Hannah Moreâ€™s more ambitious and well-known scheme for Cheap )Tj
T*(Repository Tracts of 1795. The family magazine survived for eighteen months )Tj
T*(with Trimmer as both the editor and the principal contributor, but eventually )Tj
T*(she had to give it up seemingly through exhaustion )Tj
T*( [edit] Books for charity schools )Tj
T*( Because, in Trimmer's opinion, there was a dearth of good educational material )Tj
T*(to use in charity schools, she decided to write her own. The series of books )Tj
T*(she produced between 1786 and 1798 were used in Britain and its colonies well )Tj
T*(into the 19th century.[24] Trimmer was an able promoter of her materials; she )Tj
T*(knew that her books would not reach large numbers of poor children in charity )Tj
T*(schools unless they were funded and publicized by the SPCK. She wrote in her )Tj
T*(journal â€œmy scheme without its aid, will fall to the ground".[37] Thus, she )Tj
T*(joined the society in 1787. In 1793, she sent 12 copies of her treatise )Tj
T*(Reflections upon the Education in Charity Schools with the Outlines of a Plan )Tj
T*(Appropriate Instruction for the Children of the Poor to the subcommittee that )Tj
T*(chose the books funded by the organization. In the treatise, she argued that )Tj
T*(the current charity school curriculum was outdated \(it was over 100 years old\) )Tj
T*(and needed to be replaced. She suggested a list of seven books that she herself )Tj
T*(would write: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(A Spelling Book in two Parts)Tj
T*(Scripture Lessons from the Old Testament)Tj
T*(Scripture Lessons from the New Testament)Tj
T*(Moral Instructions from the Scriptures)Tj
T*(Lessons on the Liturgy from the Book of Common Prayer)Tj
T*(Exemplary Tales)Tj
T*(The Teacher's Assistant)Tj
T*(  The committee largely accepted her proposal.[38] The Charity School Spelling )Tj
T*(Book was printed first and was the most widely-used. It was one of the first )Tj
T*(children's books for the poor that was small but still had large type and large )Tj
T*(margins \(features often considered appropriate only for books for more )Tj
T*(privileged readers\). The stories themselves were also innovative: they )Tj
T*(emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary childrenâ€”"these children climbed )Tj
T*(trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep and begged in the )Tj
T*(streets".[39] The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras )Tj
T*(system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and )Tj
T*(its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and )Tj
T*(Jamaica.[39] )Tj
T*( The proposed "Scripture Lessons" became Trimmer's An Abridgement of Scripture )Tj
T*(History, consisting of Lessons selected from the Old Testament, for the Use of )Tj
T*(Schools and Families which was an anthology of selections from the Bible. Like )Tj
T*(the Charity School Spelling Book, it was adopted throughout the British )Tj
T*(educational system and was part of school life well into the mid-19th century. )Tj
T*(In 1798 SPCK published Scripture Catechisms, Part I and II; these works were )Tj
T*(intended to aid the teacher while the Abridgements \(a shorthand name for the )Tj
T*(Scripture Histories of both the Old and New Testament that Trimmer eventually )Tj
T*(published\) were intended to aid the pupil. The "Exemplary Tales" seem not to )Tj
T*(have been written exactly as planned but Trimmer's Servant's Friend and Two )Tj
T*(Farmers fulfilled the purpose she outlined in her plan of publishing )Tj
T*(pleasurable moral tales. These two books served as Sunday school prizes as )Tj

T*(were Trimmer's adaptations and commentaries on the Book of Common Prayer, which )Tj
T*(she had printed elsewhere.[40] )Tj
T*( [edit] Fabulous Histories )Tj
T*( Fabulous Histories \(later known as The Story of the Robins\), Trimmer's most )Tj
T*(popular work, was first published in 1786, and remained in print until the )Tj
T*(beginning of the 20th century.[41] It tells the story of two families, a robin )Tj
T*(family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most )Tj
T*(importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue )Tj
T*(and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would )Tj
T*(hopefully lead one to "universal benevolence" as an adult. According to Samuel )Tj
T*(Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, â€œin its )Tj
T*(depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmerâ€™s Fabulous )Tj
T*(Histories was the most representative childrenâ€™s book of the period".[42] The )Tj
T*(text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later )Tj
T*(works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, )Tj
T*(a scholar of children's literature explains, â€œthe notion of hierarchy that )Tj
T*(underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above )Tj
T*(children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of )Tj
T*(dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animalsâ€¦ [but] )Tj
T*(the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced."[43] )Tj
T*(Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes )Tj
T*(in a larger historical context, arguing that "the fears of the author and her )Tj
T*(class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are )Tj
T*(evident. Hence, [the] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming )Tj
T*(British aggression abroad. â€¦The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: )Tj
T*(maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from )Tj
T*(the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate )Tj
T*(easily.â€[44] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer )Tj
T*(expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to )Tj
T*(her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really )Tj
T*(speak.[45] Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was )Tj
T*(concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With )Tj
T*(the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great )Tj
T*(fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous )Tj
T*(stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more )Tj
T*(worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always )Tj
T*(referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins )Tj
T*(in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be )Tj
T*(illustrated within her lifetimeâ€”pictures of talking birds would only have )Tj
T*(reinforced the paradox of the book \(it was fiction parading as a history\).[46] )Tj
T*(Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn )Tj
T*(from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.[47] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Guardian of Education )Tj
T*( Later in her life, Trimmer published the influential Guardian of Education )Tj
T*(\(June 1802 â€“ September 1806\), which included ideas for instructing children and )Tj
T*(reviews of contemporary children's books.[48] Although one previous attempt had )Tj
T*(been made to regularly review children's books in Britain,[49] according to )Tj
T*(Matthew Grenby, "it was a far less substantial and sustained enterprise than )Tj
T*(Trimmerâ€™s".[50] The Guardian included not only reviews of children's books but )Tj
T*(also extracts from texts Trimmer thought would edify her adult readers. She )Tj
T*(aimed â€œto assess the current state of educational policy and praxis in Britain )Tj
T*(and to shape its future direction".[51] To do so, she evaluated the educational )Tj
T*(theories of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah )Tj
T*(More, Madame de Genlis, Joseph Lancaster, and Andrew Bell, among others. In her )Tj
T*(â€œEssay on Christian Education,â€ also published separately later, she proposed )Tj
T*(her own comprehensive educational program. )Tj
T*( Trimmer took her reviewing very seriously and her over 400 reviews constitute )Tj
T*(a set of distinct values.[52] As Grenby puts it, "her initial questions of any )Tj
T*(childrenâ€™s books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to )Tj
T*(religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established )Tj

T*(social hierarchy".[53] Religion was always Trimmer's first priority and her )Tj
T*(emphasis on Biblical inerrancy illustrates her fundamentalism.[54] She )Tj
T*(criticized books that included scenes of death, characters who were insane, and )Tj
T*(representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten )Tj
T*(children.[55] She typically praised books that encouraged intellectual )Tj
T*(instruction, such as Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children \(1778â€“79\). )Tj
T*( Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, does not necessarily mark her as the )Tj
T*(rigid thinker that many critics have presumed her to be.[56] Grenby points out )Tj
T*(that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good; in this, )Tj
T*(she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly Puritanical )Tj
T*(attitudes towards raising children.[57] She also agreed with "Rousseauâ€™s key )Tj
T*(idea [while ironically attacking Rousseau's works themselves], later taken up )Tj
T*(by the Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too )Tj
T*(early".[58] )Tj
T*( The Guardian of Education established children's literature as a genre with )Tj
T*(her reviews. Moreover, in one of her early essays, â€œObservations on the Changes )Tj
T*(which have taken place in Books for Children and Young Persons", Trimmer wrote )Tj
T*(the first history of children's literature, setting out the first canon of )Tj
T*(children's literature. Its landmark books are still cited today by scholars as )Tj
T*(important in the development of the genre.[59] )Tj

T*(said Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water: and he said, Come. )Tj
T*(And when Peter was come out of the ship, he \(through the power of CHRIST\) )Tj
T*(walked on the water likewise; but when he saw the wind boisterous, his faith or )Tj
T*(belief in CHRIST'S power, failed, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he )Tj
T*(cried out, Lord, save me! And immediately JESUS stretched forth his hand and )Tj
T*(caught him, saying, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Fairy tales )Tj
T*( Trimmer is perhaps most famous now for her condemnation of fairy tales, such )Tj
T*(as the various translations of Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps )Tj
T*(passÃ© \(originally published in 1697\),[60] because they endorsed an irrational )Tj
T*(view of the world and suggested that children could become successful too )Tj
T*(easily \(in other words, they did not have to work\).[61] Chapbooks were the )Tj
T*(literature of the poor and Trimmer was attempting to separate children's )Tj
T*(literature from texts she associated with the lower classes; she also feared )Tj
T*(that children might gain access to this cheap literature without their parents' )Tj
T*(knowledge.[62] Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, )Tj
T*(accusing them of perpetuating superstition and unfavourable images of )Tj
T*(stepparents.[63] Rather than seeing Trimmer as a censor of fairy tales, )Tj
T*(therefore, Nicholas Tucker has argued, "by considering fairy tales as fair game )Tj
T*(for criticism rather than unthinking worship, Mrs Trimmer is at one with )Tj
T*(scholars today who have also written critically about the ideologies found in )Tj
T*(some individual stories".[64] )Tj
T*( One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because )Tj
T*(they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and )Tj
T*(control their exposure to harmful experiences.[65] She was just as horrified by )Tj
T*(the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, )Tj
T*(complaining that "little children, whose minds are susceptible of every )Tj
T*(impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to )Tj
T*(convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" should not be )Tj
T*(allowed to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife's head off.[66] )Tj

T*(particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau. She argued that there was a vast )Tj
T*(conspiracy, organized by the atheistic and democratic revolutionaries of )Tj
T*(France, to overthrow the legitimate governments of Europe. These conspirators )Tj
T*(were attempting to overturn traditional society by "endeavouring to infect the )Tj
T*(minds of the rising generation, through the medium of Books of Education and )Tj
T*(Children's Books" \(emphasis Trimmer's\).[67] Her views were shaped by AbbÃ© )Tj
T*(Barruel's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism \(1797â€“8\) \(she )Tj
T*(extracted large sections from this text into the Guardian itself\) but also by )Tj
T*(her fears of the ongoing wars between France and Britain during the 1790s.[68] )Tj
T*(Trimmer emphasized Christianity above all in her writings and maintained that )Tj
T*(one should turn to God in times of trial. As M. Nancy Cutt argues in her book )Tj
T*(on children's literature, Trimmer and writers like her "claimed emphatically )Tj
T*(that the degree of human happiness was in direct proportion to the degree of )Tj
T*(submission to the divine Will. Thus they repudiated the moralistsâ€™ view that )Tj
T*(learning should exalt reason and work to the temporal happiness of the )Tj
T*(individual, which was governed by the best interests of society".[69] Trimmer )Tj
T*(and her allies contended that French pedagogical theories led to an immoral )Tj
T*(nation, specifically, "deism, infidelity and revolution".[70] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bell vs. Lancasterian school system debate )Tj
T*( In 1789, Andrew Bell invented the Madras system of education to order to )Tj
T*(instruct British colonial subjects in India; it was a disciplinary system which )Tj
T*(employed a hierarchy of student monitors and very few teachers \(economical for )Tj
T*(the colonies, Bell argued\). He published a book, Experiment in Education )Tj
T*(\(1797\), in order to explain his system, one that he thought could be adapted )Tj
T*(for the poor in England \(in it he endorsed many of Trimmer's own books\). A year )Tj
T*(after reading the Experiment, an English Quaker, Joseph Lancaster, adopted many )Tj
T*(of its principles for his school in London and then published his own book, )Tj
T*(Improvements in Education \(1803\), which repeated many of Bell's ideas. Because )Tj
T*(of his Quaker sympathies, Lancaster did not encourage the teaching of the )Tj
T*(doctrines of the Established Church.[71] Trimmer, appalled by the suggestion )Tj
T*(that British children did not need to be brought up within the Established )Tj
T*(Church, wrote and published her Comparative View of the two systems in 1805, )Tj
T*(creating a schism between two very similar systems. According to F. J. Harvey )Tj
T*(Darton, an early scholar of children's literature, â€œher effect upon English )Tj
T*(educationâ€¦ was very considerable, even extraordinary. The two rival systems, )Tj
T*(Bellâ€™s and Lancasterâ€™s, were hotly debated all over the country, and the war )Tj
T*(between Bell and the Dragon, as a cartoonist labelled it, raged in all the )Tj
T*(magazines, even in the Edinburgh Review."[71] Out of the debate â€œarose the two )Tj
T*(great societies â€“ the National Society for Promoting the Education of the )Tj
T*(Children of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church, and the )Tj
T*(British and Foreign School Society â€“ upon whose work, fundamentally, the whole )Tj
T*(of [Britain's] later elementary school system was based".[72] )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception and legacy )Tj
T*( Trimmer's most popular book, Fabulous Histories, was reprinted for at least )Tj
T*(133 years and had a profound impact on generations of readers and writers.[76] )Tj
T*(In 1877, when the firm of Griffith and Farran published it as part of their )Tj
T*("Original Juvenile Library," they advertised it as "the delicious story of )Tj
T*(Dicksy, Flapsy, and Pecksy, who can have forgotten it? It is as fresh today as )Tj
T*(it was half a century ago."[77] Tess Cosslett has also suggested that the names )Tj
T*(of Trimmer's birds â€” Dicksy, Pecksy, Flapsy and Robinâ€”bear a striking )Tj
T*(resemblance to the rabbits â€” Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter â€” in Beatrix )Tj
T*(Potter's children's books.[78] )Tj
T*( Trimmer also influenced the children's writers of her own age; William )Tj
T*(Godwin's Fables, Ancient and Modern \(1805\), for example, imitates Trimmer's )Tj
T*(Ladder to Learning.[79] Among her contemporary admirers was Frances Burney, who )Tj
T*(remarked in a letter to her sister Esther about the education of the latter's )Tj
T*(10-year-old daughter, "Mrs. Trimmer I should suppose admirable for a girl" \(as )Tj
T*(an introduction to the Scriptures\).[80] )Tj
T*( While Trimmer was highly respected for her charity work during her lifetime )Tj
T*(and for her books long after her death, her reputation began to wane at the end )Tj
T*(of the 19th century and plummeted during the 20th century. One reason for this )Tj
T*(is that her textbooks, so widely used during the first half of the century, )Tj
T*(were replaced by secular books in the second half of the century.[81] The tone )Tj
T*(of her books was no longer seen as consonant with British society. An early )Tj
T*(scholar of children's literature, Geoffrey Summerfield, describes her this way: )Tj
T*(â€œOf all the morally shrill women active in the late 18th and early 19th )Tj
T*(centuries, she was probably the shrillest. Unbalanced, frenetic, paranoid, she )Tj
T*(may have been, but no one could deny her energy and perseverance in defending )Tj
T*(the souls of the children of England from the assaults of the devil.â€[82] )Tj
T*(Recently, however, children's literature scholars have attempted to view )Tj
T*(18th-century children's literature within its historical context rather than )Tj
T*(judge it against modern tastes; scholars such as Grenby, Ruwe, Ferguson, Fyfe )Tj
T*(and Cosslett have reassessed Trimmer's work. Because Trimmer does not fit the )Tj
T*(mold of 20th-century feminism â€” that is, since she did not rebel against the )Tj
T*(social mores of her society as did Mary Wollstonecraft â€” she did not attract )Tj
T*(the attention of early feminist scholars.[83] However, as Ruwe points out, â€œby )Tj
T*(the confluence of political, historical, and pedagogical events at the turn of )Tj
T*(the century, a woman such as Trimmer was able to gain a greater visibility in )Tj
T*(the realm of public letters than was perhaps typical before or after";[79] )Tj
T*(Trimmer was a "role model for other women authors", and these later authors )Tj
T*(often acknowledged their debt explicitly, as did the author of The Footsteps to )Tj

T*( Imagism was a movement in early 20th-century Anglo-American poetry that )Tj
T*(favored precision of imagery and clear, sharp language; it was described as the )Tj
T*(most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the )Tj
T*(Pre-Raphaelites.[1].As a poetic style it gave Modernism its early start in the )Tj
T*(20th century.[2] and yet as Rene Taupin remarked 'It is more accurate to )Tj
T*(consider Imagism not as a doctrine, nor even as a poetic school, but as the )Tj
T*(association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small )Tj
T*(number of important principle'.[3] or as has so aptly said of it 'a succession )Tj
T*(of creative moments' rather than any continuous or sustained period of )Tj
T*(development.[4]. The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical )Tj
T*(of much Romantic and Victorian poetry. This was in contrast to their )Tj
T*(contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were by and large content to work )Tj
T*(within that tradition. Group publication of work under the Imagist name )Tj
T*(appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured writing by many of the most )Tj
T*(significant figures in modernist poetry in English, as well as a number of )Tj
T*(other modernist figures prominent in fields other than poetry. )Tj
T*( Based in London, the Imagists were drawn from Great Britain, Ireland and the )Tj
T*(United States. Somewhat unusually for the time, the Imagists featured a number )Tj
T*(of women writers among their major figures. Imagism is also significant )Tj
T*(historically as the first organised Modernist English language literary )Tj
T*(movement or group. In the words of T. S. Eliot: "The point de repÃ¨re usually )Tj
T*(and conveniently taken as the starting-point of modern poetry is the group )Tj
T*(denominated 'imagists' in London about 1910."[5] )Tj
T*( At the time Imagism emerged, Longfellow and Tennyson were considered the )Tj
T*(paragons of poetry, and the public valued the sometimes moralising tone of )Tj
T*(their writings. In contrast, Imagism called for a return to what were seen as )Tj
T*(more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of )Tj
T*(language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse )Tj
T*(forms. The focus on the "thing" as "thing" \(an attempt at isolating a single )Tj
T*(image to reveal its essence\) also mirrors contemporary developments in )Tj
T*(avant-garde art, especially Cubism. Although Imagism isolates objects through )Tj
T*(the use of what Ezra Pound called "luminous details", Pound's Ideogrammic )Tj
T*(Method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction is similar )Tj
T*(to Cubism's manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single )Tj
T*(image.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Pre-Imagism )Tj
T*( Well-known poets of the Edwardian era of the 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, )Tj
T*(Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, had been working very much in the shadow )Tj
T*(of Tennyson, producing weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They )Tj
T*(continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century.[7] As )Tj
T*(the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a )Tj
T*(post which he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had )Tj
T*(a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas )Tj
T*(Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest )Tj
T*(Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a )Tj
T*(Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner )Tj
T*(William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and )Tj
T*(writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this )Tj
T*(period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling. )Tj
T*( The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems, Autumn and A City Sunset )Tj
T*(by T. E. Hulme.[8] These were published in January 1909 by the Poets' Club in )Tj
T*(London in a booklet called For Christmas MDCCCCVIII. Hulme was a student of )Tj
T*(mathematics and philosophy; he had been involved in the setting up of the club )Tj
T*(in 1908 and was its first secretary. Around the end of 1908, he presented his )Tj

T*(of free verse and modern French poetry\) was highly critical of the club and its )Tj
T*(publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. In )Tj
T*(1909, Hulme left the Poets' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets )Tj
T*(in a new group which Hulme referred to as the "Secession Club"; they met at the )Tj
T*(Eiffel Tower restaurant in London's Soho[10] to discuss plans to reform )Tj
T*(contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and haiku and the removal )Tj
T*(of all unnecessary verbiage from poems. The interest in Japanese verse forms )Tj
T*(can be placed in a context of the late Victorian and Edwardian revival of )Tj
T*(interest in Chinoiserie and Japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for )Tj
T*(William Anderson's Japanese prints donated to the British Museum, performances )Tj
T*(of Noh plays in London, and the success of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta The )Tj
T*(Mikado \(1885\). Direct literary models were available from a number of sources, )Tj
T*(including F. V. Dickins's 1866 Hyak nin is'shiu, or, Stanzas by a Century of )Tj
T*(Poets, Being Japanese Lyrical Odes, the first English-language version of the )Tj
T*(Hyakunin isshu, a 13th-century anthology of 100 tanka, the early 20th-century )Tj
T*(critical writings and poems of Sadakichi Hartmann, and contemporary )Tj
T*(French-language translations. )Tj
T*( The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and )Tj
T*(found that their ideas were close to his own. In particular, Pound's studies of )Tj
T*(Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct )Tj
T*(expression that he detected in the writings of Arnaut Daniel, Dante, and Guido )Tj
T*(Cavalcanti, amongst others. For example, in his 1911â€“12 series of essays I )Tj
T*(gather the limbs of Osiris, Pound writes of Daniel's line "pensar de lieis m'es )Tj
T*(repaus" \("it rests me to think of her"\) \(from the canzone En breu brizara'l )Tj
T*(temps braus\): "You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less )Tj
T*(rhetorical".[11] These criteria of directness, clarity and lack of rhetoric )Tj
T*(were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his )Tj
T*(friendship with Laurence Binyon, Pound had already developed an interest in )Tj
T*(Japanese art by examining Nishiki-e prints at the British Museum, and he )Tj
T*(quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms.[12][13] )Tj
T*( In an article in La France, 1915, the French critic, Remy de Gourmont )Tj
T*(described the Imagists as descendants of the French Symbolistes[14] and in a )Tj
T*(1928 letter to the French critic and translator RenÃ© Taupin, Pound was keen to )Tj
T*(emphasise another ancestry for Imagism, pointing out that Hulme was indebted to )Tj
T*(a Symbolist tradition, linking back via William Butler Yeats, Arthur Symons and )Tj
T*(the Rhymers' Club generation of British poets to MallarmÃ©.[15] and the )Tj
T*(Symbolist source was amplified further in Taupin's study published in 1929,[16] )Tj
T*(in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language )Tj
T*('between the image of the Imagist and the 'symbol' of the Symbolists there is a )Tj
T*(difference only of precision'.[17]In 1915, Pound edited the poetry of another )Tj
T*(1890s poet, Lionel Johnson for the publisher Elkin Mathews. In his )Tj
T*(introduction, he wrote )Tj
T*(â€œ)Tj
T*(No one has written purer imagism than [Johnson] has, in the line)Tj
T*(Clear lie the fields, and fade into blue air,)Tj
T*(It has a beauty like the Chinese.[18])Tj
T*(â€)Tj
T*( [edit] Early publications and statements of intent )Tj
T*( In 1911, Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his )Tj
T*(former fiancÃ©e Hilda Doolittle \(who had started signing her work H.D.\) and her )Tj
T*(future husband Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek )Tj
T*(poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The )Tj
T*(compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example )Tj
T*(complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, )Tj
T*(during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and )Tj
T*(Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. )Tj
T*(Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.[19] )Tj

T*(Ripostes was published with an appendix called The Complete Poetical Works of )Tj
T*(T. E. Hulme, which carried a note that saw the first appearance of the word )Tj
T*(Imagiste in print. Aldington's poems, Choricos, To a Greek Marble, and Au Vieux )Tj
T*(Jardin, were in the November issue of Poetry, and H.D.'s, Hermes of the Ways, )Tj
T*(Orchard, and Epigram, appeared in the January 1913 issue; Imagism as a movement )Tj
T*(was launched. Poetry's April issue published what came to be seen as "Imagism's )Tj
T*(enabling text",[20] the haiku-like poem of Ezra Pound entitled "In a Station of )Tj
T*(the Metro": )Tj
T*( The apparition of these faces in the crowd;)Tj
T*(Petals on a wet, black bough.[21])Tj
T*(  The March issue of Poetry contained A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste and the essay )Tj
T*(entitled Imagisme both written by Pound, with the latter being attributed to )Tj
T*(Flint. The latter contained this succinct statement of the group's position: )Tj
T*( Direct treatment of the "thing", whether subjective or objective.)Tj
T*(To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.)Tj
T*(As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in )Tj
T*(sequence of the metronome.[22])Tj
T*(  Pound's note opened with a definition of an image as "that which presents an )Tj
T*(intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time". Pound goes on to )Tj
T*(state that "It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce )Tj
T*(voluminous works".[23] His list of "don'ts" reinforced his three statements in )Tj
T*("Imagism", while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the )Tj
T*("result of long contemplation". Taken together, these two texts comprised the )Tj
T*(Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of )Tj
T*(the past. F.S. Flint commented 'we have never claimed to have invented the )Tj
T*(moon. We do not pretend that our ideas are original'.[24] The preface to Some )Tj
T*(Imagist Poets in 1916[25] comments Imagism does not merely mean the )Tj
T*(presentation of pictures. Imagism refers to the manner of presentation, not to )Tj
T*(the subject.' )Tj
T*( [edit] Des Imagistes )Tj
T*( Determined to promote the work of the Imagists, and particularly of Aldington )Tj
T*(and H.D., Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des Imagistes. )Tj
T*(It was first published in Alfred Kreymborg's little magazine The Glebe and was )Tj
T*(later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Boni in New York and by Harold )Tj
T*(Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London. It became one of the most important and )Tj
T*(influential English-language collections of modernist verse.[26] Included in )Tj
T*(the thirty-seven poems were ten poems by Aldington, seven by H.D., and six by )Tj
T*(Pound. The book also included work by F.S. Flint, Skipwith Cannell, Amy Lowell, )Tj
T*(William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, Allen Upward and John )Tj
T*(Cournos. )Tj
T*( Pound's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy )Tj
T*(that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active )Tj
T*(participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, )Tj
T*(had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. )Tj
T*(However, he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the )Tj
T*(renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly )Tj
T*(because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the )Tj
T*(transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, )Tj
T*(more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, )Tj
T*(which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats,[27] took on a wider importance in the )Tj
T*(history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two )Tj
T*(led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist )Tj
T*(as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in )Tj
T*(rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems )Tj
T*(written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido )Tj
T*(Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least )Tj
T*(partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets )Tj
T*(were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher. )Tj

T*( [edit] Some Imagist Poets )Tj
T*( The following year, Pound and Flint fell out over their different )Tj
T*(interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article )Tj
T*(on the history of Imagism written by Flint and published in The Egoist in May )Tj
T*(1915.[28] Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower )Tj
T*(poets, especially Storer. Pound, who believed that the "Hellenic hardness" that )Tj
T*(he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was )Tj
T*(likely to be diluted by the "custard" of Storer, was to play no further direct )Tj
T*(role in the history of the Imagists. He went on to co-found the Vorticists with )Tj
T*(his friend, the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis.[29] )Tj
T*( Around this time, the American Imagist Amy Lowell moved to London, determined )Tj
T*(to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets. Lowell was a )Tj
T*(wealthy heiress from Boston who loved Keats and cigars. She was also an )Tj
T*(enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money )Tj
T*(to publish the group. Lowell was determined to change the method of selection )Tj
T*(from Pound's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner. This )Tj
T*(new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear )Tj
T*(under her leadership: "In this new book we have followed a slightly different )Tj
T*(arrangement to that of our former Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection )Tj
T*(by an editor, each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he )Tj
T*(considers his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have )Tj
T*(appeared in book form."[30] The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies )Tj
T*(under the title Some Imagist Poets. The first of these appeared in 1915, )Tj
T*(planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington. Two further issues, both )Tj
T*(edited by Lowell, were published in 1916 and 1917. These three volumes featured )Tj
T*(most of the original poets, \(also including imagist poetry by the American poet )Tj
T*(John Gould Fletcher\),[31] with the exception of Pound, who had tried to )Tj
T*(persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who )Tj
T*(sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism "Amy-gism." )Tj
T*( Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 )Tj
T*(volumes,[32] making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and )Tj
T*(an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this )Tj
T*(period. However, with World War I as a backdrop, the times were not easy for )Tj
T*(avant-garde literary movements \(Aldington, for example, spent much of the war )Tj
T*(at the front\), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the )Tj
T*(Imagists as a movement. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Imagists after Imagism )Tj
T*( In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly suggested that Aldington should produce a )Tj
T*(new Imagist anthology.[33] Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the )Tj
T*(suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist )Tj
T*(Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the )Tj
T*(four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, )Tj
T*(who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology )Tj
T*(initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of )Tj
T*(20th-century poetry. )Tj
T*( Of the poets who were published in the various Imagist anthologies, Joyce, )Tj
T*(Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists. )Tj
T*(Marianne Moore, who was at most a fringe member of the group, carved out a )Tj
T*(unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with )Tj
T*(compression of language. William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along )Tj
T*(distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was )Tj
T*(taken "from the mouths of Polish mothers".[34] Both Pound and H.D. turned to )Tj
T*(writing long poems, but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an )Tj
T*(Imagist legacy. Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten )Tj
T*(outside the context of the history of Imagism. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Despite the movement's short life, Imagism would deeply influence the course )Tj
T*(of modernist poetry in English[35] . Richard Aldington, in his 1941 memoir, )Tj
T*(writes: "I think the poems of Ezra Pound, H.D., Lawrence, and Ford Madox Ford )Tj
T*(will continue to be read. And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his )Tj

T*(followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists." )Tj
T*(On the other hand, Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the Imagist approach: )Tj
T*("Not all objects are equal. The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize )Tj
T*(this."[36] With its demand for harness, clarity and precision and its )Tj
T*(insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant )Tj
T*(subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. )Tj
T*(Eliot 'Preludes' and 'Moving at the Window'in D. H. Lawrence animal and flower )Tj
T*(pieces.The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen-twenties owed )Tj
T*(much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style. [37] )Tj
T*( The influence of Imagism can be seen clearly in the work of the Objectivist )Tj
T*(poets,[38] who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and )Tj
T*(Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking )Tj
T*(Objectivism's principles with Imagism's, Louis Zukofsky insisted, in his )Tj
T*(introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry, on writing "which is the )Tj
T*(detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and )Tj
T*(of directing them along a line of melody." Zukofsky was a major influence on )Tj
T*(the Language poets,[39] who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a )Tj
T*(high level of development. Basil Bunting, another Objectivist poet, was a key )Tj
T*(figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival, a loose movement )Tj
T*(that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets.[40] )Tj
T*( Imagism influenced a number of poetry circles and movements.With the Imagists )Tj
T*(Free verse became a discipline and acquired staus as a legitimate poetic )Tj
T*(form.[41] In the 1950s, especially,with the Beat generation, the Black Mountain )Tj
T*(poets, and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance. In his seminal )Tj
T*(1950 essay Projective Verse, Charles Olson, the theorist of the Black Mountain )Tj
T*(group, wrote "ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER )Tj
T*(PERCEPTION";[42] his credo derived from and supplemented the Imagists.[43] )Tj
T*( Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced )Tj
T*(by the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry. William Carlos Williams )Tj
T*(was another who had a strong impact on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like )Tj
T*(Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg's )Tj

T*(anthem was modified to drop the Communist-era lyrics. An attempt was made in )Tj
T*(1995 to adopt Natalla Arsiennieva's poem "O God Almighty" as the national )Tj
T*(anthem, but the suggestion was not acted on even though it was supported by a )Tj
T*(parliamentary committee.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Anthem of the Republic of Belarus )Tj
T*( The only legal mention of the national anthem before 2002 is in the )Tj
T*(Constitution of the Republic of Belarus. Section One, Article 19 of the )Tj
T*(constitution states that "The symbols of the Republic of Belarus as a sovereign )Tj
T*(state shall be its national flag, national emblem and national anthem." While )Tj
T*(the constitution only mentioned the use of the flag, anthem and arms as )Tj
T*(national symbols, each symbol had to be defined by law.[4] A law introducing an )Tj
T*(anthem was not enacted until Presidential Decree 350 took effect, on July 18, )Tj
T*(2002, the day before Belarus's independence day. The decree's main objective )Tj
T*(was to establish lyrics for the anthem and introduce musical notation along )Tj
T*(with the new lyrics. Moreover, the decree designated when, where, and how the )Tj
T*(anthem was to be performed.[5] )Tj
T*( Before issuing the decree, President Alexander Lukashenko listened to five )Tj
T*(possible candidates for the national anthem. Three out of the five candidates, )Tj
T*(including the one ultimately chosen, used the music composed by Sakalouski and )Tj
T*(began their lyrics with the line My Belarusy.[6] According to the newspaper )Tj
T*(Soviet Byelorussia, President Lukashenko decided on the anthem on June 12, 2002 )Tj
T*(and chose to have its first performance on July 3, Belarusian independence day, )Tj
T*(the anniversary of the date in 1944 when the Wehrmacht was driven away from )Tj
T*(Minsk by the Red Army.[7] However, the first performance actually took place on )Tj
T*(July 2 at a concert organized by the government as part of the Belarusian )Tj
T*(independence festivities. )Tj
T*( Belarus did not have an anthem before one was adopted in the Soviet-era. When )Tj
T*(Lukashenko issued his decree selecting a new national anthem, only slight )Tj
T*(changes were made to the Soviet-era hymn. While the references to Russia, the )Tj
T*(Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Vladimir Lenin were replaced; the )Tj
T*(overall theme of "friendship of peoples" and the original music composed by )Tj
T*(Sakalouski were preserved. The government decided to keep Sakalouski's music in )Tj
T*(order to maintain historical continuity, and also on account of its popularity )Tj
T*(and musical quality[8] After the national anthem was adopted, the process of )Tj
T*(adopting national symbols was completed.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reaction )Tj
T*( The organization Freedom House commented on the adoption of the anthem in a )Tj
T*(report about the country, published in 2003. On page 125 of the "Country Report )Tj
T*(of Belarus", Freedom House says that President Lukashenko has "reintroduced the )Tj
T*(state symbols used by the old Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2002, )Tj
T*(the president approved a streamlined version of the Soviet-era anthem "My )Tj
T*(Belarusy" \("We Belarusians"\), as the country's new national anthem." The report )Tj
T*(also mentioned President Lukashenko's ban of the symbols that were used since )Tj
T*(Belarus's independence in 1991, such as the Pahonia arms and the white, red, )Tj
T*(white flag, which Lukashenko claims are associated with fascism \(due to the )Tj
T*(fact that the pro-Nazi Belarusian Central Rada in World War II used these )Tj
T*(symbols\) .[9] In 2003, Dr. Taras Kuzio wrote in Radio Free Europe that )Tj
T*(President Lukashenko "is the quintessential Soviet Belarusian patriot who )Tj
T*(presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia." Kuzio said that the )Tj
T*(motives of Russia and Belarus in re-adopting Soviet-era symbols are part of )Tj
T*(restoring that nostalgia.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Regulations )Tj
T*( The anthem must be performed in accordance with the lyrics and sheet music )Tj
T*(established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio )Tj
T*(stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and )Tj
T*(again upon signing off \(usually around midnight\). The anthem can also be )Tj
T*(performed on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting )Tj
T*(events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, )Tj
T*(citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police )Tj
T*(uniform must salute.[11] )Tj

T*( [edit] Other songs )Tj
T*( A favorite in the anthem competition was the poem called "Young Belarus" )Tj
T*(\(ÐœÐ°Ð»Ð°Ð´Ð°Ñ Ð‘ÐµÐ»Ð°Ñ€ÑƒÑÑŒ\) by Janka Kupala. However, the poem was never set to a )Tj
T*(musical composition so Young Belarus could not be selected as the anthem.[12] )Tj
T*( Belarus and Russia have been working towards a closer relationship with each )Tj
T*(other, resulting in the proposed Union of Russia and Belarus. While Belarus and )Tj
T*(Russia will be able to keep their own symbols, a song called "Sovereign Union )Tj

T*(anthem. The song, which was modified from the National Anthem of the Soviet )Tj
T*(Union, refers to a wider union of the two nations.[13] )Tj
T*( Some Belarusian emigrants use "Vajacki marÅ¡" and "Mahutny BoÅ¾a" as their )Tj

T*(design for the ice rink placed it along upper Randolph Street, on the park's )Tj
T*(northern edge. However, McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink was built on the )Tj
T*(western edge of Millennium Park. The Chicago Tribune's Pulitzer Prize-winning )Tj
T*(architecture critic Blair Kamin called this move "a masterstroke" and praised )Tj
T*(the new location "where the skaters symbolize the year-round vitality of the )Tj
T*(city".[11] Kamin noted the location on the east side of Michigan Avenue allowed )Tj
T*(those at the plaza and ice rink to enjoy the skyline of the Historic Michigan )Tj
T*(Boulevard District.[11] Another addition to the plaza and rink's design was the )Tj
T*(300-seat restaurant;[2] the final architectural design was completed by )Tj
T*(OWP&amp;P Architects,[11] who were also the architects for the adjoining )Tj
T*(Wrigley Square.[12] )Tj
T*( Although the rink was budgeted for $5 million, it was constructed for only )Tj
T*($3.2 million \($4.2 million today\), making it one of the few Millennium Park )Tj
T*(attractions to cost less than was initially budgeted.[13] The rink was funded )Tj
T*(by and named for the McCormick Tribune Foundation,[3] which was established by )Tj
T*(former Chicago Tribune owner and publisher Robert R. McCormick. The McCormick )Tj
T*(Tribune Foundation is a supporter of the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum and )Tj
T*(the McCormick Tribune Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, )Tj
T*(both of which are also located in Chicago.[14][15] )Tj
T*( McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink was the first feature in Millennium )Tj
T*(Park to open. Its grand opening was celebrated on December 20, 2001,[16] a few )Tj
T*(weeks ahead of the Millennium Park underground parking garage. Mayor Daley, )Tj
T*(McCormick Tribune Foundation Chairman of the Board John W. Madigan, Millennium )Tj
T*(Park private donor group chief John Bryan, actress Bonnie Hunt and other local )Tj
T*(celebrities attended the event.[2] The new ice rink was seen as a replacement )Tj
T*(for "Skate on State", a public skating rink on State Street in the Loop[17][18] )Tj
T*(which closed in 2001.[19] )Tj
T*( From June 21 to September 15, 2002, McCormick Tribune Plaza hosted the )Tj
T*(inaugural exhibit in Millennium Park,[20]Exelon Presents Earth From Above by )Tj
T*(Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a French aerial photographer. Arthus-Bertrand used planes )Tj
T*(and helicopters to photograph sites in over 60 countries on every )Tj
T*(continent,[21][22] and displayed more than 120 of these photographs in dozens )Tj
T*(of cities, starting in Paris and including Tokyo and Geneva.[20] In the summer )Tj
T*(of 2002, the book associated with the exhibit had sold over 1.5 million )Tj
T*(copies,[21] and the photographs were displayed in Brazil, Lebanon, Poland, )Tj
T*(Sweden, Germany, Britain, Norway, Hungary and along the banks of the Volga )Tj
T*(River in Russia.[20] )Tj
T*( Chicago was the first American city to host the Earth From Above )Tj
T*(exhibition.[21][23][24] The exhibit featured 4-by-6-foot \(1.2Â m Ã—Â 1.8Â m\) )Tj
T*(photographic prints that were laminated onto thin 5-by-7.5-foot \(1.5Â m Ã—Â 2.3Â m\) )Tj
T*(aluminum panels that protected them from ultraviolet rays.[20] The photographs )Tj
T*(included scenes of natural beauty such as a Filipino Bajau village built on )Tj
T*(coral reefs, a formation of rocks in Madagascar, an inlet in the Ionian Islands )Tj
T*(that is home to endangered sea turtles, and architectural highlights such as )Tj
T*(the Palace of Versailles and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. It also showed )Tj
T*(scenes of tragedy such as the 1999 earthquake in Turkey and the destruction of )Tj
T*(the Amazonian rain forest.[21][23] The exhibit used photovoltaic solar panels )Tj
T*(to store electrical energy during the day that then lit the exhibit at )Tj
T*(night.[20][25] )Tj
T*( Part of the 2006 film The Weather Man, starring Nicolas Cage, was shot at the )Tj
T*(rink.[26] In 2008, Millennium Park hosted a winter celebration called the )Tj
T*(Museum of Modern Ice. The installation included a 95-by-12-foot \(29.0Â m Ã—Â 3.7Â )Tj
T*(m\) ice wall in the park and a large abstract painting by Gordon Halloran, which )Tj
T*(was embedded in the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink. The works were titled Paintings )Tj
T*(Below Zero.[27] In 2008â€“2009 the logo for the unsuccessful Chicago bid for the )Tj
T*(2016 Summer Olympics was displayed in the rink's ice.[28] )Tj
T*( The ice rink served as the "headquarters" for the 2011 edition of Hockey )Tj
T*(Weekend Across America; the NHL on NBC broadcast its studio coverage from the )Tj

T*( [edit] Details )Tj
T*( The ice skating rink at McCormick Tribune Plaza is 200 by 80 feet \(61 by 24 )Tj
T*(m\). Due to the rink's rounded corners, the total skating surface is 15,910 )Tj
T*(square feet \(1,478Â m2\),[30][31] which critic Blair Kamin called "amply )Tj
T*(sized".[11] For comparison, this is a considerably larger skating surface than )Tj
T*(the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City, which is 120 by 60 feet \(37 by 18 )Tj
T*(m\).[32] )Tj
T*( The Millennium Park rink has a lobby which provides skaters a respite from the )Tj
T*(natural environs, as well as toilets and public lockers.[3] During the 2003â€“04 )Tj
T*(season the rink rented 77,667 pairs of ice skates.[32] By 2009â€“2010, its ninth )Tj
T*(season, it was attracting more than 100,000 skaters a year. While availability )Tj
T*(of the rink depends on the weather, it also has a state-of-the-art chiller )Tj
T*(system that can maintain the ice in the event of unseasonably warm weather. )Tj
T*(Thus, temperature is not the only factor involved in decisions to close the )Tj
T*(rink.[3] In his review of the plaza and rink, Kamin gave it two stars \(out of a )Tj
T*(possible four\), called the structure "solid, though unremarkable", and praised )Tj
T*(its uses throughout the year.[11] )Tj
T*( When the rink is closed, its surface becomes a 150-seat cafe that complements )Tj
T*(the 300-seat indoor Park Grill dining facility.[30][33] Street level features )Tj
T*(such as McCormick Tribune Plaza are linked to elevated features such as Cloud )Tj
T*(Gate and AT&amp;T Plaza, which are atop the Park Grill Restaurant and can be )Tj
T*(reached via balustraded stairs.[34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Operations )Tj
T*( Through 2006 and 2007, the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink was one of several )Tj
T*(operated by the Chicago Park District.[35] Since then, although the Chicago )Tj
T*(Park District still operates ten public ice skating rinks,[36] the Millennium )Tj
T*(Park ice rink is operated by a division of the Chicago Department of Cultural )Tj
T*(Affairs,[37][38] itself a Department of the City of Chicago Government.[39][40] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ice rink )Tj
T*( McCormick Tribune Ice Rink is generally open for skating afternoons and )Tj
T*(evenings seven days a week, with longer hours on weekends.[41] However, it is )Tj
T*(occasionally closed for private events.[35][36] Skating is free and skate )Tj
T*(rental is available.[30] Except for its first year, the rink has been scheduled )Tj
T*(to be open from mid-November until mid-March, weather permitting.[35][36] For )Tj
T*(the 2009â€“10 winter season, the rink is scheduled to be open from November 20, )Tj
T*(2009 to March 14, 2010, with abbreviated holiday schedules on Thanksgiving, )Tj
T*(Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.[41] Skating is accompanied by )Tj
T*(loudspeaker music,[4] which is mostly seasonal music during the holidays.[42] )Tj
T*( Rink attendance is heavier on the weekends and other times when school is not )Tj
T*(in session.[43][44] Romantic holidays such as Christmas Eve and Valentine's Day )Tj
T*(are also quite crowded.[42] The ice rink is a popular people watching location )Tj
T*(during the winter months;[4][5][31] many view events at the McCormick Tribune )Tj
T*(Plaza from AT&amp;T Plaza, above and to the east.[45] The ice skating rink has )Tj
T*(become so popular that when the weather was too warm for the rink's opening in )Tj
T*(November 2005, the story became international news.[46] The book 1,000 Places )Tj
T*(to See in the U.S.A. &amp; Canada Before You Die suggests a visit to McCormick )Tj
T*(Tribune Plaza during the skating season, and describes Millennium Park as a )Tj
T*(renowned attraction.[47] )Tj
T*( There are days when themed skating is encouraged. Santa attire was encouraged )Tj
T*(on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, )Tj
T*(as part of an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on )Tj
T*(ice.[48] The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance )Tj
T*(Festival; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and )Tj
T*(demonstration at the rink, and there is free dance instructions behind the )Tj
T*(glass doors of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion stage.[49] )Tj
T*( [edit] Park Grill Plaza )Tj
T*( During much of the offseason alfresco dining is available in a 150-seat cafe )Tj
T*(set up on the ice rink,[33] in what is then referred to as the Park Grill )Tj
T*(Plaza. This outdoor dining experience is associated with the Park Grill )Tj
T*(Restaurant and the Park Grill Cafe, which are both located under the Cloud Gate )Tj

T*(on AT&amp;T Plaza.[3] Architecture critic Blair Kamin compares the in-park )Tj
T*(eating options availed at the Park Grill with New York's former Tavern on the )Tj
T*(Green and Chicago's Cafe Brauer.[11] The Park Grill Plaza is the largest )Tj
T*(outdoor dining venue in Chicago,[6] and hosts a variety of events, including a )Tj
T*(benefit called "Chefs on the Grill" in which guests interact with invited chefs )Tj
T*(who are competing to produce the best dish. Wine tastings are also hosted )Tj
T*(there,[7] and during the summer, the Park Grill Plaza hosts musical )Tj
T*(performances on Thursdays.[6] During the skating season, there are rinkside )Tj
T*(tables and the Park Grill Cafe offers take out and to-go service.[50] Outdoor )Tj
T*(dining service begins in May.[51] )Tj
T*( McCormick Tribune Plaza &amp; Ice Rink is one of two features in the park to )Tj
T*(include accessible restrooms; the other is Jay Pritzker Pavilion. The restrooms )Tj
T*(are located adjacent to the Park Grill.[1] Although McCormick Plaza is a winter )Tj
T*(focal point, the park's restroom facilities at this feature are not heated for )Tj
T*(winter use.[52] )Tj
T*( According to Fodor's, the restaurant is known for a view that makes up for )Tj
T*(unimpressive service.[53] However, Citysearch speaks positively about the )Tj
T*(service.[54]Metromix, Fodor's and Frommer's all laud the location of the )Tj
T*(restaurant,[53][55][56] which serves New American cuisine.[53][55][57]Frommer's )Tj
T*(gives the restaurant 2 out of 3 stars and notes that the restaurant has a kids )Tj
T*(menu to accommodate the numerous families that visit the park.[55] Metromix )Tj
T*(notes that the restaurant is well known for its signature Park Grill Burger. )Tj
T*(The northern area of the Plaza has been named the North Lounge and has )Tj
T*(furniture for lounging; it has a distinct menu including options from the )Tj
T*(Plaza's menu, as well as its own offerings.[56] The indoor restaurant has )Tj
T*(seating for 300, a VIP room,[56] and serves dinner, lunch, and weekend )Tj
T*(brunch.[54][56] )Tj

T*(shooting the episode, series creator/executive producer David Chase held )Tj
T*(several rehearsals with the lead actors. )Tj
T*( The scenes at the lakefront vacation home were filmed over two weeks in June )Tj
T*(2006 in Putnam Valley, New York. Additional interior shots were filmed six )Tj
T*(months later at Silvercup Studios, New York, where a replica of the cabin had )Tj
T*(been built in a sound stage. The lake seen multiple times in the episode is )Tj
T*(Lake Oscawana. The scenes of Tony and Bobby fishing were filmed on location on )Tj
T*(the lake but much closer to the shore than it appears in the episode. The )Tj
T*(scenes set in Montreal were actually filmed in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Filming )Tj
T*(of the scenes set in New Jersey and the Soprano residence took place on )Tj
T*(location in Essex County, New Jersey and in Silvercup Studios. The ripping of )Tj
T*(Bobby's shirt when he commits his first murder was not in the script but was )Tj
T*(added during production. While filming the cabin fight scene between Tony and )Tj
T*(Bobby in Silvercup Studios, Steve Schirripa accidentally headbutted James )Tj
T*(Gandolfini. The fight scene was choreographed but Gandolfini didn't step out of )Tj
T*(the way in time. His nose was bloodied but not broken. The real headbutting was )Tj
T*(kept in the episode.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cast notes )Tj
T*( Gregory Antonacci, who plays Phil Leotardo's advisor Butch DeConcini on the )Tj
T*(show, is now billed in the opening credits. Joseph R. Gannascoli has been )Tj

T*( "Soprano Home Movies" drew an average of 7.66Â million viewers when it first )Tj
T*(aired on HBO on Sunday April 8, 2007 in the United States. This estimate was )Tj
T*(done by Nielsen Ratings. This was a significant drop from the 2006 season )Tj
T*(premiere episode, "Members Only", which attracted 9.47Â million viewers and the )Tj
T*(lowest ratings for a Sopranos premiere since the season two opening episode, )Tj
T*("Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist's Office...", which drew roughly the same number )Tj
T*(of viewers as "Soprano Home Movies" \(7.64Â million viewers\).[10][11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical response )Tj
T*( The episode was generally well received by critics. Tom Biro of television )Tj
T*(webblog TV Squad gave the episode a favorable review, writing "All in all, big )Tj
T*(thumbs up from me."[12] Marisa Carroll of PopMatters called the midseason )Tj
T*(premiere "stellar" and wrote that "David Chase repeatedly re-imagines ordinary )Tj
T*(family scenariosâ€”like a weekend trip to the mountainsâ€”in brutal, gangster )Tj
T*(terms. [...] Such signature exaggerations remain both hilarious and )Tj
T*(unsettling." She awarded the episode a score of 9 out of 10 \(shared with the )Tj
T*(following two episodes\).[13] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle praised )Tj
T*(the episode, writing "the series remains as vital and interesting as ever [...] )Tj
T*(There may be no better \(or realistic\) way to go forward into this Sopranos swan )Tj
T*(song."[14] Kim Reed of Television Without Pity gave the midseason premiere an )Tj
T*(Aâˆ’, writing "...while, on the surface, not much happened, I think there were a )Tj
T*(ton of callbacks to previous episodes and that familiar Soprano tension was )Tj
T*(used to good effect."[15] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wrote "this is )Tj
T*(loose, contemplative Sopranos storytelling at its best."[16] Lisa Schwarzbaum )Tj
T*(of Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the midseason premiere and wrote )Tj
T*(that, despite not being a very eventful episode on the surface, "everything )Tj
T*(happened".[17] Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger gave "Soprano Home Movies" a )Tj
T*(positive review and praised it for featuring the character of Bobby Bacala in a )Tj
T*(more prominent role, writing "The hour was largely a refresher course on Tony, )Tj
T*(Janice and their history, but it also gave Bacala the dignity he's so often )Tj
T*(been deprived by the writers."[18] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times )Tj
T*(gave the episode a mixed review, calling it "solemn" and wrote that "even )Tj
T*(before last season the series had started to sag in places, a creative fatigue )Tj

T*( Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal )Tj
T*(historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to )Tj
T*(have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was )Tj
T*(written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost )Tj
T*(all of the material in the Chronicle is in the form of annals, by year; the )Tj
T*(earliest are dated at 60 BC \(the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of )Tj
T*(Britain\), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle )Tj
T*(was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts )Tj
T*(collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. )Tj
T*( The Chronicle is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other )Tj
T*(medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or )Tj
T*(told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different )Tj
T*(versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle is the )Tj
T*(single most important historical source for the period in England between the )Tj
T*(departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of )Tj
T*(the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, )Tj
T*(the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; )Tj
T*(in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of )Tj
T*(Middle English in existence. )Tj
T*( Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the )Tj
T*(British Library. The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and )Tj
T*(the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. )Tj
T*( [edit] Composition )Tj
T*( All of the surviving manuscripts are copies, so it is not known for certain )Tj
T*(where or when the first version of the Chronicle was composed. It is generally )Tj
T*(agreed that the original version was written in the late 9th century by a )Tj
T*(scribe in Wessex.[2][3][notes 1] After the original Chronicle was compiled, )Tj
T*(copies were made and distributed to various monasteries. Additional copies were )Tj
T*(made, for further distribution or to replace lost manuscripts, and some copies )Tj
T*(were updated independently of each other. Some of these later copies are those )Tj
T*(that have survived.[4] )Tj
T*( The earliest extant manuscript, the Winchester Chronicle, was written by a )Tj
T*(single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, )Tj
T*(in the margin of the next line; subsequent material was written by other )Tj
T*(scribes.[5] This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later )Tj
T*(than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of )Tj
T*(the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred, known to have been composed in )Tj
T*(893.[6] It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from )Tj
T*(the original Chronicle; as a result, there is no proof that the Chronicle was )Tj
T*(compiled at Winchester.[7] It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, )Tj
T*(but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign )Tj
T*(of Alfred the Great \(871â€“99\), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning )Tj
T*(and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a written )Tj
T*(language. The Chronicle, as well as the distribution of copies to other centres )Tj
T*(of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Surviving manuscripts )Tj
T*( Of the nine surviving manuscripts, seven are written entirely in Old English )Tj
T*(\(also known as Anglo-Saxon\). One, known as the Bilingual Canterbury Epitome, is )Tj
T*(in Old English with a translation of each annal into Latin. Another, the )Tj
T*(Peterborough Chronicle, is in Old English except for the last entry, which is )Tj
T*(in early Middle English. The oldest \(Corp. Chris. MS 173\) is known as the )Tj
T*(Winchester Chronicle or the Parker Chronicle \(after Matthew Parker, an )Tj
T*(Archbishop of Canterbury, who once owned it\). Six of the manuscripts were )Tj
T*(printed in an 1861 edition for the Rolls Series by Benjamin Thorpe with the )Tj
T*(text laid out in columns labelled A to F. Following this convention, the three )Tj
T*(additional manuscripts are often called [G], [H] and [I]. The surviving )Tj
T*(manuscripts are listed below. )Tj
T*( [edit] Relationships between the manuscripts )Tj

T*(copying. The diagram at right gives an overview of the relationships between )Tj
T*(the manuscripts. The following is a summary of the relationships that are )Tj
T*(known.[5] )Tj
T*( [A2] was a copy of [A], made in Winchester, probably between 1001 and 1013.)Tj
T*([B] was used in the compilation of [C] at Abingdon, in the mid-11th century. )Tj
T*(However, the scribe for [C] also had access to another version, which has not )Tj
T*(survived.)Tj
T*([D] includes material from Bede's Ecclesiastical History and from a set of )Tj
T*(8th-century Northumbrian annals and is thought to have been copied from a )Tj
T*(northern version that has not survived.)Tj
T*([E] has material that appears to derive from the same sources as [D] but does )Tj
T*(not include some additions that appear only in [D], such as the Mercian )Tj
T*(Register. This manuscript was composed at the monastery in Peterborough, some )Tj
T*(time after a fire there in 1116 that probably destroyed their copy of the )Tj
T*(Chronicle; [E] appears to have been created thereafter as a copy of a Kentish )Tj
T*(version, probably from Canterbury.)Tj
T*([F] appears to include material from the same Canterbury version that was used )Tj
T*(to create [E].)Tj
T*(Asser's Life of King Alfred, which was written in 893, includes a translation )Tj
T*(of the Chronicle's entries from 849 to 887. Only [A], of surviving manuscripts, )Tj
T*(could have been in existence by 893, but there are places where Asser departs )Tj
T*(from the text in [A], so it is possible that Asser used a version that has not )Tj
T*(survived.[notes 2])Tj
T*(Ã†thelweard wrote a translation of the Chronicle into Latin in the late 10th )Tj
T*(century; the version he used probably came from the same branch in the tree of )Tj
T*(relationships that [A] comes from.[10])Tj
T*(Asser's text agrees with [A] and with Ã†thelweard's text in some places against )Tj
T*(the combined testimony of [B], [C], [D] and [E], implying that there is a )Tj
T*(common ancestor for the latter four manuscripts.[11])Tj
T*(At Abingdon, some time between 1120 and 1140, an unknown author wrote a Latin )Tj
T*(chronicle known as the Annals of St Neots. This work includes material from a )Tj
T*(copy of the Chronicle, but it is very difficult to tell which version because )Tj
T*(the annalist was selective about his use of the material. It may have been a )Tj
T*(northern recension, or a Latin derivative of that recension.[10])Tj
T*(  All the manuscripts described above share a chronological error between the )Tj
T*(years 756 and 845, but it is apparent that the composer of the Annals of St )Tj
T*(Neots was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have )Tj
T*(preceded them. Ã†thelweard's copy did have the chronological error but it had )Tj
T*(not lost a whole sentence from annal 885; all the surviving manuscripts have )Tj
T*(lost this sentence. Hence the error and the missing sentence must have been )Tj
T*(introduced in separate copying steps, implying that none of the surviving )Tj
T*(manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] History of the manuscripts )Tj
T*( [edit] The Winchester Chronicle )Tj
T*( [A]: The Winchester \(or Parker\) Chronicle is the oldest manuscript of the )Tj
T*(Chronicle that survives. It was begun at Old Minster, Winchester, towards the )Tj
T*(end of Alfred's reign. The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred, and )Tj
T*(the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC.[5] The section containing the )Tj
T*(Chronicle takes up folios 1â€“32.[12] Unlike the other manuscripts, [A] is of )Tj
T*(early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in )Tj
T*(the hands of different scribes as the entries were made. The first scribe's )Tj
T*(hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century; his entries cease )Tj
T*(in late 891, and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the )Tj
T*(10th century by several scribes. The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the )Tj
T*(years 925â€“955, and was clearly at Winchester when he wrote them since he adds )Tj
T*(some material related to events there; he also uses ceaster, or "city", to mean )Tj
T*(Winchester.[13] The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions )Tj
T*(after the entry for 975. The book, which also had a copy of the Laws of Alfred )Tj
T*(and Ine bound in after the entry for 924, was transferred to Canterbury some )Tj
T*(time in the early 11th century,[5] as evidenced by a list of books that )Tj

T*(Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi.[12] While at Canterbury, some )Tj
T*(interpolations were made; this required some erasures in the manuscript. The )Tj
T*(additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript )Tj
T*(from which [E] descends.[13] The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070. )Tj
T*(After this comes the Latin Acta Lanfranci, which covers church events from )Tj
T*(1070â€“1093. This is followed by a list of popes and the Archbishops of )Tj
T*(Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium. The manuscript was acquired by )Tj
T*(Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury \(1559â€“1575\)[5] and master of Corpus )Tj
T*(Christi College, Cambridge, following the dissolution of the monasteries, and )Tj
T*(bequeathed to the college on his death. It now forms part of the Parker )Tj
T*(Library. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Abingdon Chronicle I )Tj
T*( [B] The Abingdon Chronicle I was written by a single scribe in the second half )Tj
T*(of the 10th century. The Chronicle takes up folios 1â€“34.[14] It begins with an )Tj
T*(entry for 60 BC and ends with the entry for 977. A manuscript that is now )Tj
T*(separate \(British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178\) was originally the )Tj
T*(introduction to this chronicle; it contains a genealogy, as does [A], but )Tj
T*(extends it to the late 10th century. [B] was at Abingdon in the mid-11th )Tj
T*(century, because it was used in the composition of [C]. Shortly after this it )Tj
T*(went to Canterbury, where interpolations and corrections were made. As with )Tj
T*([A], it ends with a list of popes and the archbishops of Canterbury to whom )Tj
T*(they sent the pallium.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Abingdon Chronicle II )Tj
T*( [C] includes additional material from local annals at Abingdon, where it was )Tj
T*(composed.[5] The section containing the Chronicle \(folios 115â€“64\) is preceded )Tj
T*(by King Alfred's Old English translation of Orosius's world history, followed )Tj
T*(by a menologium and some gnomic verses of the laws of the natural world and of )Tj
T*(humanity.[15] Then follows a copy of the chronicle, beginning with 60 BC; the )Tj
T*(first scribe copied up to the entry for 490, and a second scribe took over up )Tj
T*(to the entry for 1048. [B] and [C] are identical between 491 and 652, but )Tj
T*(differences thereafter make it clear that the second scribe was also using )Tj
T*(another copy of the Chronicle. This scribe also inserted, after the annal for )Tj
T*(915, the Mercian Register, which covers the years 902â€“924, and which focuses on )Tj
T*(Aethelflaed. The manuscript continues to 1066 and stops in the middle of the )Tj
T*(description of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In the 12th century a few lines )Tj
T*(were added to complete the account.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Worcester Chronicle )Tj
T*( [D] The Worcester Chronicle appears to have been written in the middle of the )Tj
T*(11th century. After 1033 it includes some records from Worcester, so it is )Tj
T*(generally thought to have been composed there. Five different scribes can be )Tj
T*(identified for the entries up to 1054, after which it appears to have been )Tj
T*(worked on at intervals. The text includes material from Bede's Ecclesiastical )Tj
T*(History and from a set of 8th-century Northumbrian annals. It is thought that )Tj
T*(some of the entries may have been composed by Archbishop Wulfstan. [D] contains )Tj
T*(more information than other manuscripts on northern and Scottish affairs, and )Tj
T*(it has been speculated that it was a copy intended for the Anglicised Scottish )Tj
T*(court. From 972 to 1016, the sees of York and Worcester were both held by the )Tj
T*(same personâ€”Oswald from 972, Ealdwulf from 992, and Wulfstan from 1003, and )Tj
T*(this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at Worcester. By the )Tj
T*(16th century, parts of the manuscript were lost; eighteen pages were inserted )Tj
T*(containing substitute entries from other sources,[5] including [A], [B], [C], )Tj
T*(and [E]. These pages were written by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to )Tj
T*(Matthew Parker.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Peterborough Chronicle )Tj
T*( [E] The Peterborough Chronicle: In 1116, a fire at the monastery at )Tj
T*(Peterborough destroyed most of the buildings. The copy of the Chronicle kept )Tj
T*(there may have been lost at that time or later, but in either case shortly )Tj
T*(thereafter a fresh copy was made, apparently copied from a Kentish versionâ€”most )Tj
T*(likely to have been from Canterbury.[5] The manuscript was written at one time )Tj
T*(and by a single scribe, down to the annal for 1121.[17] The scribe added )Tj

T*(material relating to Peterborough Abbey which is not in other versions. The )Tj
T*(Canterbury original which he copied was similar, but not identical, to [D]: the )Tj
T*(Mercian Register does not appear, and a poem about the Battle of Brunanburh in )Tj
T*(937, which appears in most of the other surviving copies of the Chronicle, is )Tj
T*(not recorded. The same scribe then continued the annals through to 1131; these )Tj
T*(entries were made at intervals, and thus are presumably contemporary records. )Tj
T*(Finally, a second scribe, in 1154, wrote an account of the years 1132â€“1154; but )Tj
T*(his dating is known to be unreliable. This last entry is in Middle English, )Tj
T*(rather than Old English. [E] was once owned by William Laud, Archbishop of )Tj
T*(Canterbury 1633â€“1654, so is also known as the Laud Chronicle.[5] The manuscript )Tj
T*(contains occasional glosses in Latin, and is referred to \(as "the Saxon storye )Tj
T*(of Peterborowe church"\) in an antiquarian book from 1566.[17] According to )Tj
T*(Joscelyn, Nowell had a transcript of the manuscript. Previous owners include )Tj
T*(William Camden[18] and William L'Isle; the latter probably passed the )Tj
T*(manuscript on to Laud.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome )Tj
T*( [F] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome: At about 1100, a copy of the Chronicle )Tj
T*(was written at Christ Church, Canterbury,[20] probably by one of the scribes )Tj
T*(who made notes in [A]. This version is written in both Old English and Latin; )Tj
T*(each entry in Old English was followed by the Latin version. The version the )Tj
T*(scribe copied \(on folios 30â€“70[21]\) is similar to the version used by the )Tj
T*(scribe in Peterborough who wrote [E], though it seems to have been abridged. It )Tj
T*(includes the same introductory material as [D] and, along with [E], is one of )Tj
T*(the two chronicles that does not include the "Battle of Brunanburh" poem. The )Tj
T*(manuscript has many annotations and interlineations, some made by the original )Tj
T*(scribe and some by later scribes,[5] including Robert Talbot.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Copy of the Winchester Chronicle )Tj
T*( [A2]/[G] Copy of the Winchester Chronicle: [A2] was copied from [A] at )Tj
T*(Winchester in the eleventh century and follows a 10th-century copy of an Old )Tj
T*(English translation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History.[12] The last annal copied )Tj
T*(was 1001, so the copy was made no earlier than that; an episcopal list appended )Tj
T*(to [A2] suggests that the copy was made by 1013. This manuscript was almost )Tj
T*(completely destroyed in the 1731 fire at Ashburnham House, where the Cotton )Tj
T*(Library was housed.[5] Of the original 34 leaves, seven remain, ff. 39â€“47 in )Tj
T*(the manuscript.[22] However, a transcript had been made by Laurence Nowell, a )Tj
T*(16th century antiquary, which was used by Abraham Wheloc in an edition of the )Tj
T*(Chronicle printed in 1643.[5] Because of this, it is also sometimes known as )Tj
T*([W], after Wheloc.[5] The appellations [A], [A2], and [G] derive from Plummer, )Tj
T*(Smith, and Thorpe, respectively.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cottonian Fragment )Tj
T*( The Cottonian Fragment [H] consists of a single leaf, containing annals for )Tj
T*(1113 and 1114. In the entry for 1113 it includes the phrase "he came to )Tj
T*(Winchester"; hence it is thought likely that the manuscript was written at )Tj
T*(Winchester. There is not enough of this manuscript for reliable relationships )Tj
T*(to other manuscripts to be established.[5] Ker notes that the entries may have )Tj
T*(been written contemporarily.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Easter Table Chronicle )Tj
T*( [I] Easter Table Chronicle: A list of Chronicle entries accompanies a table of )Tj
T*(years, found on folios 133-37 in a badly burned manuscript containing )Tj
T*(miscellaneous notes on charms, the calculation of dates for church services, )Tj
T*(and annals pertaining to Christ Church, Canterbury.[24] Most of the Chronicle's )Tj
T*(entries pertain to Christ Church, Canterbury. Until 1109 \(the death of Anselm )Tj
T*(of Canterbury\) they are in English; all but one of the following entries are in )Tj
T*(Latin.[25] Part of [I] was written by a scribe soon after 1073,[5] in the same )Tj
T*(hand and ink as the rest of the Caligula MS. After 1085, the annals are in )Tj
T*(various contemporary hands. The original annalist's entry for the Norman )Tj
T*(conquest is limited to "Her forÃ°ferde eadward kyng"; a later hand added the )Tj
T*(coming of William the Conqueror, "7 her com willelm."[25] At one point this )Tj

T*(manuscript called Hist. Angliae Saxonica in his gifts but the manuscript that )Tj
T*(included this, now Cambridge University Library MS. Hh.1.10, has lost 52 of its )Tj
T*(leaves, including all of this copy of the chronicle.[11][27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sources, reliability and dating )Tj
T*( The Chronicle incorporates material from multiple sources. The entry for 755, )Tj
T*(describing how Cynewulf took the kingship of Wessex from Sigebehrt, is far )Tj
T*(longer than the surrounding entries, and includes direct speech quotations from )Tj
T*(the participants in those events. It seems likely that this was taken by the )Tj
T*(scribe from existing saga material.[28] Early entries, up to the year 110, )Tj
T*(probably came from one of the small encyclopaedic volumes of world history in )Tj
T*(circulation at the time the Chronicle was first written. The chronological )Tj
T*(summary to Bede's Ecclesiastical History was used as a source. The Chronicle )Tj
T*(gives dates and genealogies for Northumbrian and Mercian kings, and provides a )Tj
T*(list of Wessex bishops; these are likely to have had separate sources. The )Tj
T*(entry for 661 records a battle fought by Cenwalh that is said to have been )Tj
T*(fought "at Easter"; this precision implies a contemporary record, which )Tj
T*(survived and was re-used by the Chronicle scribe.[29] )Tj
T*( Contemporary annals began to be kept in Wessex during the 7th )Tj
T*(century.[30][notes 3] The material compiled in Alfred's reign included annals )Tj
T*(relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon )Tj
T*(history, but, with the exception of the Cynewulf entry, does not gather )Tj
T*(momentum until it comes to the Danish invasions of the late 8th century )Tj
T*(onwards.[31] The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, )Tj
T*(drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a )Tj
T*(page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, )Tj
T*(with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As )Tj
T*(the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took )Tj
T*(up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, )Tj
T*(especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of )Tj
T*(historical narrative under the year headings.[32] )Tj
T*( As with any historical source, the Chronicle has to be treated with some )Tj
T*(caution. For example, between 514 and 544 the Chronicle makes reference to )Tj
T*(Wihtgar, who is supposedly buried on the Isle of Wight at "Wihtgar's )Tj
T*(stronghold" \(which is "WihtgarÃ¦sbyrg" in the original\) and purportedly gave his )Tj
T*(name to the island. However, the name of the "Isle of Wight" derives from the )Tj
T*(Latin "Vectis", not from Wihtgar. The actual name of the fortress was probably )Tj
T*("Wihtwarabyrg", "the stronghold of the inhabitants of Wight", and either the )Tj
T*(chronicler or an earlier source misinterpreted this as referring to )Tj
T*(Wihtgar.[33][34] )Tj
T*( The dating of the events recorded also requires care. In addition to dates )Tj
T*(that are simply inaccurate, scribes occasionally made mistakes that caused )Tj
T*(further errors. For example, in the [D] manuscript, the scribe omits the year )Tj
T*(1044 from the list on the left hand side. The annals copied down are therefore )Tj
T*(incorrect from 1045 to 1052, which has two entries. A more difficult problem is )Tj
T*(the question of the date at which a new year began, since the modern custom of )Tj
T*(starting the year on 1 January was not universal at that time. The entry for )Tj
T*(1091 in [E] begins at Christmas and continues throughout the year; it is clear )Tj
T*(that this entry follows the old custom of starting the year at Christmas. Some )Tj
T*(other entries appear to begin the year on 25 March, such as the year 1044 in )Tj
T*(the [C] manuscript, which ends with Edward the Confessor's marriage on 23 )Tj
T*(January, while the entry for 22 April is recorded under 1045. There are also )Tj
T*(years which appear to start in September.[35] )Tj
T*( The manuscripts were produced in different places, and each manuscript )Tj
T*(reflects the biases of its scribes. It has been argued that the Chronicle )Tj
T*(should be regarded as propaganda, produced by Alfred's court and written with )Tj
T*(the intent of glorifying Alfred and creating loyalty.[36] This is not )Tj
T*(universally accepted,[notes 4] but the origins of the manuscripts clearly )Tj
T*(colour both the description of interactions between Wessex and other kingdoms, )Tj

T*(and the descriptions of the Vikings' depredations. An example can be seen in )Tj
T*(the entry for 829, which describes Egbert's invasion of Northumbria. According )Tj
T*(to the Chronicle, after Egbert conquered Mercia and Essex, he became a )Tj
T*("bretwalda", implying overlordship of all of England. Then when he marched into )Tj
T*(Northumbria, the Northumbrians offered him "submission and peace". The )Tj
T*(Northumbrian chronicles incorporated into Roger of Wendover's 13th-century )Tj
T*(history give a different picture: "When Egbert had obtained all the southern )Tj
T*(kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province )Tj
T*(with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute."[38][39] )Tj
T*( Occasionally the scribes' biases can be seen by comparing different versions )Tj
T*(of the manuscript they created. For example, Ã†lfgar, earl of East Anglia, and )Tj
T*(son of Leofric, the earl of Mercia, was exiled briefly in 1055. The [C], [D] )Tj
T*(and [E] manuscripts say the following:[40][41] )Tj
T*( [C]: "Earl Ã†lfgar, son of Earl Leofric, was outlawed without any fault . . .")Tj
T*([D]: "Earl Ã†lfgar, son of Earl Leofric, was outlawed well-nigh without fault . )Tj
T*(. .")Tj
T*([E]: "Earl Ã†lfgar was outlawed because it was thrown at him that he was traitor )Tj
T*(to the king and all the people of the land. And he admitted this before all the )Tj
T*(men who were gathered there, although the words shot out against his will.")Tj
T*(  Another example that mentions Ã†lfgar shows a different kind of unreliability )Tj
T*(in the Chronicle: that of omission. Ã†lfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in )Tj
T*(that year was exiled again. This time only [D] has anything to say: "Here Earl )Tj
T*(Ã†lfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the )Tj
T*(help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from Norway; it is tedious )Tj
T*(to tell how it all happened."[40] In this case other sources exist to clarify )Tj
T*(the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [E] says )Tj
T*(nothing at all, and [D] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that )Tj
T*(when the Chronicle is silent, other sources that report major events must be )Tj
T*(mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the Chronicle does omit important )Tj
T*(events.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Use by Latin and Anglo-Norman historians )Tj
T*( The three main Anglo-Norman historians, John of Worcester, William of )Tj
T*(Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon, each had a copy of the Chronicle, which )Tj
T*(they adapted for their own purposes.[42]Simeon of Durham also had a copy of the )Tj
T*(Chronicle.[11] Some later medieval historians also used the Chronicle, and )Tj
T*(others took their material from those who had used it, and so the Chronicle )Tj
T*(became "central to the mainstream of English historical tradition".[42] )Tj
T*( Henry of Huntingdon used a copy of the Chronicle that was very similar to [E]. )Tj
T*(There is no evidence in his work of any of the entries in [E] after 1121, so )Tj
T*(although his manuscript may have been actually been [E], it may also have been )Tj
T*(a copyâ€”either one taken of [E] prior to the entries he makes no use of, or a )Tj
T*(manuscript from which [E] was copied, with the copying taking place prior to )Tj
T*(the date of the last annal he uses. Henry also made use of the [C] )Tj
T*(manuscript.[11] )Tj
T*( The Waverley annals made use of a manuscript that was similar to [E], though )Tj
T*(it appears that it did not contain the entries focused on Peterborough. The )Tj
T*(manuscript of the chronicle translated by Geoffrey Gaimar's cannot be )Tj
T*(identified accurately, though according to historian Dorothy Whitelock it was )Tj
T*("a rather better text than 'E' or 'F'". Gaimar implies that there was a copy at )Tj
T*(Winchester in his day \(the middle of the 12th century\); Whitelock suggests that )Tj
T*(there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day )Tj
T*(was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century. If it survived to Gaimar's time )Tj
T*(that would explain why [A] was not kept up to date, and why [A] could be given )Tj
T*(to the monastery at Canterbury.[11] )Tj
T*( John of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis appears to have had a manuscript )Tj
T*(that was either [A] or similar to it; he makes use of annals that do not appear )Tj
T*(in other versions, such as entries concerning Edward the Elder's campaigns and )Tj
T*(information about Winchester towards the end of the chronicle. His account is )Tj
T*(often similar to that of [D], though there is less attention paid to Margaret )Tj
T*(of Scotland, an identifying characteristic of [D]. He had the Mercian register, )Tj

T*(which appears only in [C] and [D]; and he includes material from annals 979â€“982 )Tj
T*(which only appears in [C]. It is possible he had a manuscript that was an )Tj
T*(ancestor of [D]. He also had sources which have not been identified, and some )Tj
T*(of his statements have no earlier surviving source.[11] )Tj
T*( A manuscript similar to [E] was available to William of Malmesbury, though it )Tj
T*(is unlikely to have been [E] as that manuscript is known to have still been in )Tj
T*(Peterborough after the time William was working, and he does not make use of )Tj
T*(any of the entries in [E] that are specifically related to Peterborough. It is )Tj
T*(likely he had either the original from which [E] was copied, or a copy of that )Tj
T*(original. He mentions that the chronicles do not give any information on the )Tj
T*(murder of Alfred Atheling, but since this is covered in both [C] and [D] it is )Tj
T*(apparent he had no access to those manuscripts. On occasion he appears to show )Tj
T*(some knowledge of [D] but it is possible that his information was taken from )Tj
T*(John of Worcester's account. He also omits any reference to a battle fought by )Tj
T*(Cenwealh in 652; this battle is mentioned in [A], [B], and [C], but not in [E]. )Tj
T*(He does mention a battle fought by Cenwealh at Wirtgernesburg, which is not in )Tj
T*(any of the extant manuscripts, so it is possible he had a copy now lost.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Importance )Tj
T*( The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is the single most important source for the history )Tj
T*(of England in Anglo-Saxon times. Without the Chronicle and Bede's Historia )Tj
T*(ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum \(the Ecclesiastical History of the English )Tj
T*(People\), it would be impossible to write the history of the English from the )Tj
T*(Romans to the Norman Conquest.[43] It is clear that records and annals of some )Tj
T*(kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of )Tj
T*(Christianity, but no such records survive in their original form. Instead they )Tj
T*(were incorporated in later works, and it is thought likely that the Chronicle )Tj
T*(contains many of these. The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its )Tj
T*(compilers, but also that recorded by earlier annalists, whose work is in many )Tj
T*(cases preserved nowhere else.[44] )Tj
T*( Its importance is not limited to the historical information it provides, )Tj
T*(however. It is just as important a source for the early development of )Tj
T*(English.[43] The Peterborough Chronicle changes from the standard Old English )Tj
T*(literary language to early Middle English after 1131, providing some of the )Tj
T*(earliest Middle English text known.[5] )Tj
T*( The Chronicle is not without literary interest. Inserted at various points )Tj
T*(since the 10th century are Old English poems in celebration of royal figures )Tj
T*(and their achievements: "The Battle of Brunanburh" \(937\), on King Ã†thelstan's )Tj
T*(victory over the combined forces of Vikings, Scots and the Strathclyde Britons, )Tj
T*(and five shorter poems, "Capture of the Five Boroughs" \(942\), "The Coronation )Tj
T*(of King Edgar" \(973\), "The Death of King Edgar" \(975\), "The Death of Prince )Tj
T*(Alfred" \(1036\), and "The Death of King Edward the Confessor" \(1065\). )Tj
T*( [edit] History of editions and availability )Tj
T*( An important early printed edition of the Chronicle appeared in 1692, by )Tj
T*(Edmund Gibson, an English jurist and divine who became Bishop of Lincoln in )Tj
T*(that year. Titled Chronicum Saxonicum, it printed Latin and Old English )Tj
T*(versions of the text in parallel columns and became the standard edition until )Tj
T*(the 19th century.[45] It was superseded in 1861 by Benjamin Thorpe's Rolls )Tj
T*(edition, which printed six versions in columns, labelled A to F, thus giving )Tj
T*(the manuscripts the letters which are now used to refer to them. )Tj
T*( John Earle wrote Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel \(1865\).[46]Charles )Tj
T*(Plummer edited this book, producing a Revised Text with notes, appendices, and )Tj
T*(glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899.[47][48] This edition of the A and E )Tj
T*(texts, with material from other versions, was widely used; it was reprinted in )Tj
T*(1952.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Editions of the individual manuscripts )Tj
T*( Beginning in the 1980s, a new set of scholarly editions have been printed )Tj
T*(under the series title "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition". )Tj
T*(Some volumes are still projected, such as a volume focusing on the northern )Tj
T*(recension, but existing volumes such as Janet Bately's edition of [A] are now )Tj
T*(standard references.[5] A recent translation of the Chronicle is Michael )Tj

T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula is generally a gnarled shrub or small tree to 8Â m \(25Â ft\), )Tj
T*(although usually smaller. The trunk has thick orange-brown wrinkled and warty )Tj
T*(bark, and the new growth is hairy but becomes smooth as it ages.[1] New shoot )Tj
T*(growth is in spring and summer.[2] The shiny green leaves are obovate to oblong )Tj
T*(in shape and measure 3â€“22Â cm \(1.4â€“9Â in\) in length, and 1â€“2Â cm \(0.4â€“0.8Â in\) in )Tj
T*(width. The leaf ends are truncate and the margins flat and serrated. Flowering )Tj
T*(is in autumn, from March to June; the green-yellow flower spikes, known as )Tj
T*(inflorescences, are terminal, found on the ends of branches and emerging from )Tj
T*(the foliage. Measuring 4 to 20Â cm \(1.6â€“8Â in\) in height and 8 to 9Â cm \(2.8â€“3.2Â )Tj
T*(in\) in width, they are various shades of pale and greenish yellow.[1] Anywhere )Tj
T*(from 800 to 1700 individual small flowers arise from a central woody spike \(or )Tj
T*(rachis\). Initially tipped with white conical pollen presenters, the flowers )Tj
T*(open sequentially from the bottom to the top of the inflorescence over one to )Tj
T*(two weeks,[3] in a process known as anthesis. Each flower produces nectar for )Tj
T*(around seven days after opening.[4] The flower spikes turn grey as they age and )Tj
T*(up to 25 finely furred grey follicles appear, which can be very large, )Tj
T*(measuring 3â€“4.5Â cm \(1.2â€“2.6Â in\) long, 2â€“3.5Â cm \(0.8â€“1.4Â in\) high, and 2â€“3.5Â cm )Tj
T*(\(0.8â€“1.4Â in\) wide. They split open either after bushfire or spontaneously, and )Tj
T*(release oval seeds 4â€“4.7Â cm \(1.6â€“1.9Â in\) in length, composed of a wedge-shaped )Tj
T*(body 1â€“1.5Â cm \(0.4â€“0.6Â in\) long and 1.1â€“1.6Â cm \(0.4â€“0.6Â in\) wide, and curved )Tj
T*(wing 2â€“3.2Â cm \(0.8â€“1.3Â in\) wide. Banksia aemula resprouts from its woody )Tj
T*(lignotuber after fire.[1] )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula closely resembles Banksia serrata, but the latter can be )Tj
T*(distinguished by a greyer, not orange-brown, trunk, and adult leaves wider than )Tj
T*(2Â cm \(0.8Â in\) in diameter. Inflorescences of serrata are generally a duller )Tj
T*(grey-yellow in colour, and have longer \(2â€“3Â mm\), more fusiform \(spindle-shaped\) )Tj
T*(or cylindrical pollen presenters tipping unopened flowers.[5][6] Finally, the )Tj
T*(follicles are smaller.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula was called wallum by the Kabi people of the Sunshine Coast, )Tj
T*(giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia but also to the name )Tj
T*(of the ecological community it grows in.[8]Banyalla is another aboriginal name )Tj
T*(for the species.[7] )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula was collected by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in June 1801 in )Tj
T*(the vicinity of Port Jackson, and published by him in his 1810 work Prodromus )Tj
T*(Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific name, Latin for )Tj
T*('similar', refers to its similarity to B.Â serrata.[7] Brown also collected a )Tj
T*(taller tree-like specimen from Sandy Cape which he called Banksia elatior; the )Tj
T*(specific name is the comparative form of the Latin adjective Ä“lÄtus )Tj
T*("elevated".[9][10] )Tj
T*( For many years in New South Wales, the wallum banksia had gone by the )Tj
T*(scientific name of Banksia serratifolia. Richard Anthony Salisbury had )Tj
T*(published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by Otto Kuntze, and )Tj
T*(then Karel Domin in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George )Tj
T*(conclusively established aemula as the correct name to be used in his 1981 )Tj
T*(revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the )Tj
T*(leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a nomen )Tj
T*(dubiumâ€”the description could have fit juvenile leaves of B.Â paludosa as well. )Tj
T*(In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether serratifolia applied to what he )Tj
T*(called Banksia aemula. Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in )Tj
T*(Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural )Tj
T*(order of Proteeae, but that entry might also refer to serrata.[1] Where )Tj
T*(Salisbury got his material is unclear, but John White had sent material to )Tj
T*(James Edward Smith now held in the Linnean Society marked as B.Â serratifolia )Tj
T*(Salisb. as well as B.Â aemula R.Br.[11] )Tj
T*( Under Brown's taxonomic arrangement, B.Â aemula and B.Â elatior were placed in )Tj
T*(subgenus Banksia verae, the "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a )Tj
T*(typical Banksia flower spike. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan )Tj

T*(classification. Meissner further divided Eubanksia into four series, with B.Â )Tj
T*(aemula placed in series Quercinae on the basis of its toothed leaves.[12] When )Tj
T*(George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he )Tj
T*(discarded Meissner's series, replacing them with four sections. B.Â aemula was )Tj
T*(placed in Orthostylis, a somewhat heterogeneous section containing 18 )Tj
T*(species.[13] This arrangement would stand for over a century. )Tj
T*( In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., )Tj
T*(on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as )Tj
T*(Banksia J.R.Forst &amp; G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. )Tj
T*(Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.Â aemula as )Tj
T*(Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally )Tj
T*(conserved.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Current placement )Tj
T*( Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his classic )Tj
T*(1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. \(Proteaceae\).[1] Endlicher's Eubanksia )Tj
T*(became B.Â subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections. B.Â aemula was )Tj
T*(placed in B.Â sect. Banksia, and this was further divided into nine series, with )Tj
T*(B.Â aemula placed in B.Â ser. Banksia. He thought its closest relative was )Tj
T*(clearly Banksia serrata and then B.Â ornata, and that the three formed a link )Tj
T*(with western species. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of )Tj
T*(Fraser's specimens as syntypes \(shared type specimens\) for the species, George )Tj
T*(also chose a lectotype \(a single specimen to serve as the type specimen\).[1] )Tj
T*( In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the )Tj
T*(genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different )Tj
T*(from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.Â aemula )Tj
T*(in series Banksia, placing it in B.Â subser. Banksia along with serrata as its )Tj
T*(sister taxon \(united by their unusual seedling leaves\) and ornata as next )Tj
T*(closest relative.[14] This arrangement stood until 1999, when George )Tj
T*(effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of )Tj
T*(Australia series.[15] )Tj
T*( Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B.Â aemula's taxonomic )Tj

T*(  In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast again showed the three eastern )Tj

T*(of the series Banksia. Instead, they formed a sister group to a large group )Tj
T*(comprising the series Prostratae, Ochraceae, Tetragonae \(including Banksia )Tj
T*(elderiana\), Banksia lullfitzii and Banksia baueri.[16] )Tj
T*( In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their )Tj

T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula is found along the east coast of Australia from around 70Â km )Tj
T*(\(45Â mi\) north of Bundaberg in central Queensland down to Sydney.[2] )Tj
T*(Specifically, its southernmost occurrence is at La Perouse on the northern side )Tj
T*(of Botany Bay.[19] It is also found on Fraser, Moreton and North Stradbroke )Tj
T*(Islands. Almost all populations are within a few kilometres of the coast, )Tj
T*(except for one at Agnes Banks in western Sydney, and two just north and south )Tj
T*(of Grafton at Coaldale and Glenreagh, and a last around 30Â km \(19Â mi\) southwest )Tj
T*(of Bundaberg.[2] )Tj
T*( Banksia aemula is most commonly found in deep sandy soils, either on dunes or )Tj
T*(flattish areas which may be seasonally wet. On coastal dunes in southern )Tj
T*(Queensland, it replaces Banksia serrata, which occupies the same niche to the )Tj
T*(south.[11] The latter areas, with open woodland or heathland, are known as )Tj
T*(wallum.[7] In Queensland it is found with Banksia robur, with the latter )Tj
T*(species found in flatter wetter areas and B.Â aemula found on rises. It is also )Tj
T*(found with Banksia oblongifolia in Queensland.[2] In some areas of wallum, it )Tj
T*(may grow as a small tree, along with mallee forms of the red bloodwood )Tj
T*(\(Corymbia gummifera\).[20] In Cooloola National Park, it is an occasional )Tj
T*(emergent plant \(along with Melaleuca quinquenervia and Eucalyptus umbra\) in )Tj
T*(closed graminoid heathland, a community of shrubs 0.5â€“2 m \(1.5â€“7Â ft\) high )Tj

T*(Foxes \(Pteropus poliocephalus\) were also observed visiting B.Â aemula and their )Tj
T*(heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding.[29] Bird species )Tj
T*(that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.Â aemula include Rainbow )Tj
T*(Lorikeet, Scarlet,[30] and Lewin's Honeyeaters.[3] Several other honeyeaters )Tj
T*(were recorded on B.Â aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the )Tj
T*(New Holland, Brown, White-cheeked, and Tawny-crowned Honeyeaters, Noisy Miner, )Tj
T*(Little Wattlebird and Noisy Friarbird.[2] The Bundjalung field study found the )Tj
T*(Brown Honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.Â aemula pollen than other )Tj

T*(recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to )Tj
T*(overgrowth by Leptospermum laevigatum.[32] Experimenting with seed germination )Tj
T*(and early growth of B.Â aemula showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, )Tj

T*( A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes )Tj
T*(found B.Â aemula grew on ridges \(dry heath\) and B. oblongifolia on slopes \(wet )Tj

T*(the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and )Tj
T*(that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species )Tj
T*(does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath.[35] Unlike similar situations )Tj
T*(with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species did not appear to )Tj
T*(impact negatively on each other.[36] A field study on seedling recruitment )Tj
T*(conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South )Tj
T*(Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in )Tj
T*(low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater )Tj
T*(survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths.[37] Field work including the )Tj
T*(experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that )Tj
T*(Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of )Tj
T*(germination, and that they can germinate in the presence or absence of recent )Tj

T*( Dan Leno \(20 December 1860Â â€“ 31 October 1904\), born George Wild Galvin, was a )Tj
T*(leading English music hall comedian and musical theatre actor during the late )Tj
T*(Victorian era. He was best known, aside from his music hall act, for his dame )Tj
T*(roles in the annual pantomimes that were popular at London's Theatre Royal, )Tj
T*(Drury Lane, from 1888 to 1904. )Tj
T*( Leno was born in St Pancras, London, and began to entertain as a child. In )Tj
T*(1864, he joined his parents on stage in their music hall act, and he made his )Tj
T*(first solo appearance, aged nine, at the Britannia Music Hall in Coventry. As a )Tj
T*(youth, he was famous for his clog dancing, and in his teen years, he became the )Tj
T*(star of his family's act. He adopted the stage name Dan Leno and, in 1884, made )Tj
T*(his first performance under that name in London. As a solo artist, he became )Tj
T*(increasingly popular during the late 1880s and 1890s, when he was one of the )Tj
T*(highest-paid comedians in the world. He developed a music hall act of talking )Tj
T*(about life's mundane subjects, mixed with comic songs and surreal observations, )Tj
T*(and created a host of mostly working-class characters to illustrate his )Tj
T*(stories. In 1901, still at the peak of his career, he performed his "Huntsman" )Tj
T*(sketch for Edward VII at Sandringham. The monarch was so impressed that Leno )Tj
T*(became publicly known as "the king's jester". )Tj
T*( Leno also appeared in burlesque and, every year from 1888 to 1904, in the )Tj
T*(Drury Lane Theatre's Christmas pantomime spectacles. He was generous and active )Tj
T*(in charitable causes, especially to benefit performers in need. Leno continued )Tj
T*(to appear in musical comedies and his own music hall routines until 1902, )Tj
T*(although he suffered increasingly from alcoholism. This, together with his long )Tj
T*(association with dame and low comedy roles, prevented him from being taken )Tj
T*(seriously as a dramatic actor, and he was turned down for Shakespearean roles. )Tj
T*(Leno began to behave in an erratic and furious manner by 1902, and he suffered )Tj
T*(a mental breakdown in early 1903. He was committed to a mental asylum, but was )Tj
T*(discharged later that year. After one more show, his health declined, and he )Tj
T*(died aged 43. )Tj
T*( [edit] Biography )Tj
T*( [edit] Family background and early life )Tj
T*( Leno was born in St Pancras, London. He was the youngest of six children, )Tj
T*(including two elder brothers, John and Henry, and an elder sister, Frances. Two )Tj
T*(other siblings died in infancy.[1] His parents, John Galvin \(1826â€“1864\) and his )Tj
T*(wife Louisa, nÃ©e Dutton \(1831â€“1891\), performed together in a music hall double )Tj
T*(act called "The Singing and Acting Duettists". They were known professionally )Tj
T*(as Mr. and Mrs. Johnny Wild.[2] They were not very successful, and the family )Tj
T*(struggled in poverty.[3][n 1] )Tj
T*( Having had very little schooling, and being raised by performers, Leno learned )Tj
T*(to entertain as a child.[3] In 1862, Leno's parents and elder brothers appeared )Tj
T*(at the Surrey Music Hall in Sheffield, then performed in northern cities later )Tj
T*(in the year.[5] In 1864, at the age of four, Leno joined his parents on stage )Tj
T*(for the first time, at the Cosmotheca Music Hall in Paddington, under the )Tj
T*(billing "Little George, the Infant Wonder, Contortionist, and Posturer".[3][6] )Tj
T*( When Leno was still four, his father, an alcoholic, died at the age of 37. The )Tj
T*(family moved to Liverpool a few months later, where his mother married William )Tj
T*(Grant, a comedian of Lancastrian and Irish descent, who performed in music )Tj
T*(halls throughout the British provinces under the stage name of William )Tj
T*(Leno.[3][7] Grant was a seasoned actor and had previously been employed by )Tj
T*(Charles Kean in his theatre company at the Princess's Theatre in London.[8] In )Tj
T*(1866, the family home in Marylebone was demolished to make way for St Pancras )Tj
T*(railway station[9] and, as a result, Leno's sister Frances was sent to live )Tj
T*(with an uncle, while his brother John, who performed occasionally with his )Tj
T*(parents, took full-time employment.[3] Leno, his mother, stepfather and brother )Tj
T*(Henry moved north and settled in Liverpool, where they performed in various )Tj
T*(halls and theatres, including the Star Music Hall, but often returned to London )Tj
T*(to perform in the capital's music halls.[3][7] )Tj

T*(clog dancing double act known as "The Great Little Lenos". This was the first )Tj
T*(time that Leno used his stepfather's stage name, "Leno", which he never )Tj
T*(registered legally.[10] The same year, Leno also appeared in his first )Tj
T*(pantomime, in Liverpool, where he had a supporting part as a juvenile clown in )Tj
T*(Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap alongside his parents, who appeared as )Tj
T*("Mr and Mrs Leno â€“ Comic Duettists".[11] On 18 July 1866, Leno, Henry and their )Tj
T*(parents appeared on the opening night of the Cambridge Music Hall in Toxteth, )Tj
T*(Liverpool, under the billing "Mr. and Mrs. Leno, the Great, Sensational, )Tj
T*(Dramatic and Comic Duettists and The Brothers Leno, Lancashire Clog, Boot and )Tj
T*(Pump Dancers".[12] The following year, the brothers made their first appearance )Tj
T*(without their parents at the Britannia music hall in Hoxton.[3] Although )Tj
T*(initially successful, the pair would experience many bouts of unemployment and )Tj
T*(often busked outside London pubs to make a living.[10] Tired of surviving on )Tj
T*(little or no money, Henry left the clog dancing act to take up a trade in )Tj
T*(London, forcing Leno to consider a future as a solo performer. Henry later )Tj
T*(founded a dance school.[n 2] Soon, however, Henry was replaced intermittently )Tj
T*(in the act by the boys' uncle, Johnny Danvers, who was a week older than )Tj
T*(Leno.[10][n 3] Leno and Danvers were close from an early age.[14] )Tj
T*( Leno made his debut as a solo performer in 1869, returning to the Britannia )Tj
T*(music hall in Hoxton, where he became known as "The Great Little Leno, the )Tj
T*(Quintessence of Irish Comedians".[n 4] The name was suggested by his )Tj
T*(stepfather, William, who thought the Irish connection would appeal to audiences )Tj
T*(on their upcoming visit to Dublin.[13] Arriving in Ireland the same year, the )Tj
T*(Lenos were struggling financially and stayed with William's relatives. In )Tj
T*(addition to his performances as part of the family act, young Leno appeared as )Tj
T*(a solo act under an Irish-sounding stage name, "Dan Patrick".[1] This allowed )Tj
T*(him to earn a separate fee of 23 shillings per performance plus living )Tj
T*(expenses.[13] The name "Dan" was chosen to honour Dan Lowery, a northern music )Tj
T*(hall comedian and music hall proprietor whom the Lenos had met a few months )Tj
T*(earlier.[15] During this tour of Ireland, the Lenos appeared in Dublin in a )Tj
T*(pantomime written by Leno's father: Old King Humpty; or, Harlequin Emerald Isle )Tj
T*(and Katty of Killarney \(1869\), in which Leno received praise from Charles )Tj
T*(Dickens, who was in the audience and told him: "Good little man, you'll make )Tj
T*(headway!"[16] )Tj
T*( In 1870, the Lenos appeared in another pantomime by Leno's father, Jack the )Tj
T*(Giant Killer; or, Harlequin Grim Gosling, or the Good Fairy Queen of the Golden )Tj
T*(Pine Grove, in which Leno played the title character and also featured in the )Tj
T*(variety entertainment that preceded the pantomime. This was his last theatrical )Tj
T*(role until 1886.[17] Throughout the 1870s, Leno and his parents performed as )Tj
T*("The Comic Trio \(Mr. &amp; Mrs. Leno and Dan Patrick\) In Their Really Funny )Tj
T*(Entertainments, Songs and Dances".[1] In the family act with his parents and )Tj
T*(Danvers, young Leno often took the leading role in such sketches as his )Tj
T*(stepfather's The Wicklow Wedding. Another of their sketches was Torpedo Bill, )Tj
T*(in which Leno played the title role, an inventor of explosive devices. His )Tj
T*(parents played a "washerwoman" and a "comic cobbler".[13] This was followed by )Tj
T*(another sketch, Pongo the Monkey.[18] Opening at Pullan's Theatre of Varieties )Tj
T*(in Bradford on 20 May 1878, this burlesque featured Leno as an escaped monkey; )Tj
T*(it became his favourite sketch of the period.[13] )Tj
T*( The teenage Leno's growing popularity led to bookings at, among others, the )Tj
T*(Varieties Theatre in Sheffield and the Star Music Hall in Manchester.[19] At )Tj
T*(the same time, Leno's clog dancing continued to be so good that in 1880 he won )Tj
T*(the world championship at the Princess's Music Hall in Leeds,[1] for which he )Tj
T*(received a gold and silver belt weighing 44.5 oz \(1.26Â kg\).[6][7] His )Tj
T*(biographer, the pantomime librettist J. Hickory Wood, described his act: "He )Tj
T*(danced on the stage; he danced on a pedestal; he danced on a slab of slate; he )Tj
T*(was encored over and over again; but throughout his performance, he never )Tj
T*(uttered a word".[20] )Tj
T*( In 1878, Leno and his family moved to Manchester.[21] There, he met Lydia )Tj
T*(Reynolds, who, in 1883, joined the Leno family theatre company, which already )Tj
T*(consisted of his parents, Danvers and Leno. The following year, Leno and )Tj

T*(Reynolds married; around this time, he adopted the stage name "Dan Leno".[21] )Tj
T*(On 10 March 1884, the Leno family took over the running of the Grand Varieties )Tj
T*(Theatre in Sheffield.[22] The Lenos felt comfortable with their working class )Tj
T*(Sheffield audiences. On their opening night, over 4,000 patrons entered the )Tj
T*(theatre, paying sixpence to see Dan Leno star in Doctor Cut 'Em Up. In October )Tj
T*(1884, facing tough competition, the Lenos gave up the lease on the theatre.[23] )Tj
T*( In 1885, Leno and his wife moved to Clapham Park, London, and Leno gained new )Tj
T*(success with a solo act that featured comedy patter, dancing and song.[21] On )Tj
T*(the night of his London debut, he appeared in three music halls: the Foresters' )Tj
T*(Music Hall in Mile End, Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane and )Tj
T*(Gatti's-in-the-Road, where he earned Â£5 a week in total \(Â£400 in 2013 adjusted )Tj
T*(for inflation\).[24][25] Although billed as "The Great Irish Comic Vocalist and )Tj
T*(Clog Champion" at first, he slowly phased out his dancing in favour of )Tj
T*(character studies, such as "Going to Buy Milk for the Twins",[7] "When Rafferty )Tj
T*(Raffled his Watch" and "The Railway Guard".[1] His dancing had earned him )Tj
T*(popularity in the provinces, but Leno found that his London audiences preferred )Tj
T*(these sketches and his comic songs.[6][26] Leno's other London venues in the )Tj
T*(late 1880s included the Collins Music Hall in Islington, the Queen's Theatre in )Tj
T*(Poplar and the Standard in Pimlico.[27] )Tj
T*( Leno was a replacement in the role of Leontes in the 1888 musical burlesque of )Tj
T*(the ancient Greek character Atalanta at the Strand Theatre, directed by Charles )Tj
T*(Hawtrey.[28] It was written by Hawtrey's brother, George P. Hawtrey, and it )Tj
T*(starred Frank Wyatt, Willie Warde and William Hawtrey.[29] The Illustrated )Tj
T*(Sporting and Dramatic News praised Leno's singing and dancing and reported )Tj
T*(that: "He brings a good deal of fun and quaintness to the not very important )Tj
T*(part of Leontes."[30] Leno accepted the role at short notice, with no )Tj
T*(opportunity to learn the script. But his improvised comedy helped to extend the )Tj
T*(life of the show. When Leno and Stanley left a few months later, the production )Tj
T*(closed.[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Music hall )Tj
T*( During the 1890s, Leno was the leading performer on the music hall stage, )Tj
T*(rivalled only by Albert Chevalier, who moved into music hall from the )Tj
T*(legitimate theatre.[32][33] Their styles and appeal were very different: Leno's )Tj
T*(characters were gritty working-class realists, while Chevalier's were )Tj
T*(overflowing in romanticism, and his act depicted an affluent point of view. The )Tj
T*(two represented the opposite poles of cockney comedy.[32][n 5] )Tj
T*( For his music hall acts, Leno created characters that were based on )Tj
T*(observations about life in London, including shopwalkers, grocer's assistants, )Tj
T*(beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, )Tj
T*(garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a Spanish bandit, a fireman )Tj
T*(and a hairdresser.[1] One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip. Leno would )Tj
T*(sing a verse of a song, then begin a monologue, often his You know Mrs. Kelly? )Tj
T*(routine, which became a well-known catchphrase: "You see we had a row once, and )Tj
T*(it was all through Mrs. Kelly. You know Mrs. Kelly, of course. ... Oh, you must )Tj
T*(know Mrs. Kelly; everybody knows Mrs. Kelly."[6][35][36] )Tj
T*( For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers )Tj
T*(and composers. One such composer was Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early )Tj
T*(successes.[37] Other well-known composers of the day who supplied Leno with )Tj
T*(numbers included Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar.[37] From 1890, Leno )Tj
T*(commissioned George Le Brunn to compose the incidental music to many of his )Tj
T*(songs, including "The Detective", "My Old Man", "Chimney on Fire", "The Fasting )Tj
T*(Man", "The Jap", "All Through A Little Piece of Bacon" and "The Detective )Tj
T*(Camera".[37] Le Brunn also provided the incidental music for three of Leno's )Tj
T*(best-known songs that depicted life in everyday occupations: "The Railway )Tj
T*(Guard" \(1890\), "The Shopwalker" and "The Waiter" \(both from 1891\).[38] The )Tj
T*(songs in each piece became instantly distinctive and familiar to Leno's )Tj
T*(audiences, but his occasional changes to the characterisations kept the )Tj
T*(sketches fresh and topical.[39] )Tj
T*( "The Railway Guard" featured Leno in a mad characterisation of a railway )Tj

T*(in a real employee at Brixton station who concerned himself in other people's )Tj
T*(business while, at the same time, not doing any work.[40] "The Shopwalker" was )Tj
T*(full of comic one-liners and was heavily influenced by pantomime. Leno played )Tj
T*(the part of a shop assistant, again of manic demeanour, enticing imaginary )Tj
T*(clientele into the shop before launching into a frantic selling technique sung )Tj
T*(in verse.[41] Leno's depiction of "The Waiter", dressed in an over-sized dinner )Tj
T*(jacket and loose-fitting white dickey, which would flap up and hit his face, )Tj
T*(was of a man consumed in self-pity and indignation. Overworked, overwrought and )Tj

T*(bad service faster than the customers could complain:[41][36] )Tj

T*( [edit] Pantomime )Tj
T*( Leno's first London appearance in pantomime was as Dame Durden in Jack and the )Tj
T*(Beanstalk, which he performed at London's Surrey Theatre in 1886, having been )Tj
T*(spotted singing "Going to Buy Milk" by the Surrey Theatre manager, George )Tj
T*(Conquest.[42] Conquest also hired Leno's wife to star in the production.[43] )Tj
T*(The pantomime was a success, and Leno received rave reviews; as a result, he )Tj
T*(was booked to star as Tinpanz the Tinker in the following year's pantomime, )Tj
T*(which had the unique title of Sinbad and the Little Old Man of the Sea; or, The )Tj
T*(Tinker, the Tailor, the Soldier, the Sailor, Apothecary, Ploughboy, Gentleman )Tj
T*(Thief.[43] )Tj
T*( After these pantomime performances proved popular with audiences, Leno was )Tj
T*(hired in 1888 by Augustus Harris, manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to )Tj
T*(appear in that year's Christmas pantomime, Babes in the Wood.[44] Harris's )Tj
T*(pantomime productions at the huge theatre were known for their extravagance and )Tj
T*(splendour. Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, )Tj
T*(acrobats, marionettes and animals, and included an elaborate transformation )Tj
T*(scene and an energetic harlequinade. Often they were partly written by )Tj
T*(Harris.[45][46]Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls starred with Leno in the )Tj
T*(next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. Campbell had appeared in the )Tj
T*(theatre's previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those )Tj
T*(productions, E. L. Blanchard. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, )Tj
T*(believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas )Tj
T*(pantomimes.[44] This was not a view shared by audiences or the critics, one of )Tj
T*(whom wrote: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I am inclined to think "the cake" for frolicsome humour is taken by the dapper )Tj
T*(new-comer, Mr. Dan Leno, who is sketched as the galvanic baroness in the )Tj
T*(wonderfully amusing dance which sets the house in a roar. The substantial )Tj
T*("babes", Mr. Herbert Campbell and Mr. Harry Nicholls, would have no excuse if )Tj
T*(they did not vie in drollery with the light footed Dan Leno.[47])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Babes in the Wood was a triumph: the theatre reported record attendance, and )Tj
T*(the run was extended until 27 April 1889.[48] Leno considerably reduced his )Tj
T*(music-hall engagements as a consequence.[48][49] Nevertheless, between April )Tj
T*(and October 1889, Leno appeared simultaneously at the Empire Theatre and the )Tj
T*(Oxford Music Hall, performing his one-man show.[49] By this time, Leno was much )Tj
T*(in demand and had bookings for the next three years. On 9 May 1889 he starred )Tj
T*(for George P. Hawtrey in a matinee of Penelope, a musical version of a famous )Tj
T*(farce The Area Belle, to benefit the Holborn Lodge for Shop Girls. In this )Tj
T*(benefit, he played the role of Pitcher opposite the seasoned Gilbert and )Tj
T*(Sullivan performer Rutland Barrington.[49]The Times considered that his )Tj
T*(performance treated the piece "too much in the manner of pantomime".[50] During )Tj

T*(Leno's long association with the Drury Lane pantomimes, he appeared chiefly as )Tj
T*(the dame.[51] After Harris died in 1896, Arthur Collins became manager of the )Tj
T*(theatre and oversaw \(and often helped to write\) the pantomimes.[48] )Tj
T*( In their pantomimes, the diminutive Leno and the massive Campbell were a )Tj
T*(visually comic duo.[52] They would often deviate from the script, improvising )Tj
T*(freely. This was met with some scepticism by producers, who feared that the )Tj
T*(scenes would not be funny to audiences and observed that, in any event, they )Tj
T*(were rarely at their best until a few nights after opening.[1]George Bernard )Tj
T*(Shaw wrote of one appearance: "I hope I never again have to endure anything )Tj
T*(more dismally futile",[53] and the English essayist and caricaturist Max )Tj
T*(Beerbohm stated that "Leno does not do himself justice collaborating with the )Tj
T*(public". He noted, however, that Leno "was exceptional in giving each of his )Tj
T*(dames a personality of her own, from extravagant queen to artless gossip".[54] )Tj
T*(In Sleeping Beauty, Leno and Campbell caused the audience to laugh even when )Tj
T*(they could not see them: they would arrive on stage in closed palanquins and )Tj
T*(exchange the lines, "Have you anything to do this afternoon, my dear?"Â â€“ "No, I )Tj
T*(have nothing on", before being carried off again.[1] Leno and Campbell's )Tj
T*(pantomimes from 1889 were Jack and the Beanstalk \(1889 and 1899\), Beauty and )Tj
T*(the Beast \(1890 and 1900\), Humpty Dumpty \(1891 and 1903\), Little Bo-peep )Tj
T*(\(1892\), Robinson Crusoe \(1893\), Dick Whittington and His Cat \(1894\), Cinderella )Tj
T*(\(1895\), Aladdin \(1896\), The Babes in the Wood \(1897\) and the Forty Thieves )Tj
T*(\(1898\).[55] )Tj
T*( Leno considered the dame roles in two of his last pantomimes, Bluebeard \(1901\) )Tj
T*(and Mother Goose \(1902\), written by J. Hickory Wood, to be his favourites. He )Tj
T*(was paid Â£200 \(Â£16,100 in 2013 adjusted for inflation\)[24] for each of the )Tj
T*(pantomime seasons.[56][57] Leno appeared at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in )Tj
T*(Bluebeard, a character described by Wood as "a sprightly, somewhat below middle )Tj
T*(aged person who was of a coming on disposition and who had not yet abandoned )Tj
T*(hope"[58]The Times drama critic noted: "It is a quite peculiar and original )Tj
T*(Sister Anne, who dances breakdowns and sings strange ballads to a still )Tj
T*(stranger harp and plays ping-pong with a frying-pan and potatoes and burlesques )Tj
T*(Sherlock Holmes and wears the oddest of garments and dresses her hair like Miss )Tj
T*(Morleena Kenwigs, and speaks in a piping voiceÂ â€“ in short it is none other than )Tj
T*(Dan Leno whom we all know".[59]Mother Goose provided Leno with one of the most )Tj
T*(challenging roles of his career, in which he was required to portray the same )Tj
T*(woman in several different guises. Wood's idea, that neither fortune nor beauty )Tj
T*(would bring happiness, was illustrated by a series of magical character )Tj
T*(transformations.[60] The poor, unkempt and generally ugly Mother Goose )Tj
T*(eventually became a rich and beautiful but tasteless parvenu, searching for a )Tj
T*(suitor. The production was one of Drury Lane's most successful pantomimes, )Tj
T*(running until 28 March 1903.[60] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later career )Tj
T*( In 1896, the impresario Milton Bode approached Leno with a proposal for a )Tj
T*(farcical musical comedy vehicle devised for him called Orlando Dando, the )Tj
T*(Volunteer, by Basil Hood with music by Walter Slaughter. Leno's agent declined )Tj
T*(the offer, as his client was solidly booked for two years. Bode offered Leno )Tj
T*(Â£625 \(Â£68,144 in 2013 adjusted for inflation\)[24] for a six-week appearance in )Tj
T*(1898. Upon hearing this, the comedian overrode his agent and accepted the )Tj
T*(offer.[61] Leno toured the provinces in the piece and was an immediate success. )Tj
T*(So popular was his performance that Bode re-engaged him for a further two )Tj
T*(shows: the musical farce In Gay Piccadilly! \(1899\), by George R. Sims, in which )Tj
T*(Leno's uncle, Johnny Danvers appeared \(The Era said that Leno was "attracting )Tj
T*(huge houses" and called him "excruciatingly funny"\);[62] and the musical comedy )Tj
T*(Mr. Wix of Wickham \(1902\). Both toured after their original runs.[61][63][64] )Tj
T*(In 1897, Leno went to America and made his debut on 12 April of that year at )Tj
T*(Hammerstein's Olympia Music Hall on Broadway, where he was billed as "The )Tj
T*(Funniest Man On Earth". Reviews were mixed: one newspaper reported that the )Tj
T*(house roared its approval, while another complained that Leno's English humour )Tj
T*(was out of date.[65] His American engagement came to an end a month later, and )Tj
T*(Leno said that it was "the crown of my career".[66] Despite his jubilation, )Tj

T*(Leno was conscious of the few negative reviews he had received and rejected all )Tj
T*(later offers to tour the United States and Australia.[66] )Tj
T*( The same year, the comedian lent his name and writing talents to Dan Leno's )Tj
T*(Comic Journal. The paper was primarily aimed at young adults and featured a )Tj
T*(mythologised version of LenoÂ â€“ the first comic paper to take its name from, and )Tj
T*(base a central character on, a living person. Published by C. Arthur Pearson, )Tj
T*(Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a )Tj
T*(year.[61] Leno wrote most of the paper's comic stories and jokes, and Tom )Tj
T*(Browne contributed many of the illustrations.[67] The comedian retained )Tj
T*(editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit.[68] The Journal )Tj
T*(was known for its slogans, including "One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World )Tj
T*(Grin" and "Won't wash clothes but will mangle melancholy". The cover always )Tj
T*(showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at work and play. Inside, )Tj
T*(the features included "Daniel's Diary", "Moans from the Martyr", two yarns, a )Tj
T*(couple of dozen cartoons and "Leno's LatestÂ â€“ Fresh Jokes and Wheezes Made on )Tj
T*(the Premises".[69] After a run of nearly two years the novelty wore off, and )Tj
T*(Leno lost interest. The paper shut down on 2 December 1899.[67][68] )Tj
T*( A journalist wrote, in the late 1890s, that Leno was "probably the highest )Tj
T*(paid funny man in the world".[70] In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny )Tj
T*(Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was )Tj
T*(demolished in 1971.[71] Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, )Tj
T*(in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder.[7] Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood )Tj
T*(commented: "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was )Tj
T*(always doing something, and had something else to do afterwards; or he had just )Tj
T*(been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to )Tj
T*(follow."[72] )Tj
T*( Between 1901 and 1903, Leno recorded more than twenty-five songs and )Tj
T*(monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label.[73] On 26 November )Tj
T*(1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline )Tj
T*(Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House to take part in a Royal Command )Tj
T*(Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and )Tj
T*(his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Leno performed a thirty-five )Tj
T*(minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: "How to Buy a House" )Tj
T*(and "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, "The King, the Queen )Tj
T*(and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how )Tj
T*(much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands )Tj
T*(with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because )Tj
T*(she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funnyÂ â€“ I was really trying to )Tj
T*(look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself."[74][75] As a )Tj
T*(memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and )Tj
T*(thereafter, Leno became known as "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music )Tj
T*(hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's )Tj
T*(reign.[74][76] )Tj
T*( [edit] Personal life )Tj
T*( In 1883, Leno met Sarah Lydia Reynolds \(1866â€“1942\), a young dancer and comedy )Tj
T*(singer from Birmingham, while both were appearing at King Ohmy's Circus of )Tj
T*(Varieties, Rochdale.[77] The daughter of a stage carpenter,[78] Lydia, as she )Tj
T*(was known professionally, was already an accomplished actress as a teenager: of )Tj
T*(her performance in Sinbad the Sailor in 1881, one critic wrote that she "played )Tj
T*(Zorlida very well for a young artiste. She is well known at this theatre and )Tj
T*(with proper training will prove a very clever actress."[79] She and Leno )Tj
T*(married in 1884 in a discreet ceremony at St. George's Church, in Hulme, )Tj
T*(Manchester, soon after the birth of their first daughter, Georgina.[80] A )Tj
T*(second child died in infancy,[81] and John was born in 1888.[1] Their three )Tj
T*(youngest childrenÂ â€“ Ernest \(b. 1889\), Sidney \(b. 1891\) and May \(b. 1896\)Â â€“ all )Tj
T*(followed their father onto the stage. Sidney later performed as Dan Leno, )Tj
T*(Jr.[82] Upon the retirement of his parents, Leno supported them financially )Tj
T*(until their deaths.[83] )Tj

T*(and eggs. He would also send these as gifts to friends and family at )Tj
T*(Christmas.[84] In 1898, Leno and his family moved to 56 Akerman Road, Lambeth, )Tj
T*(where they lived for several years. A blue plaque was erected there in 1962 by )Tj
T*(the London County Council.[85] )Tj
T*( [edit] Charity and fundraising )Tj
T*( The Terriers Association was established in 1890 to help retired artists in )Tj
T*(need of financial help. Leno was an active fundraiser in this and in the Music )Tj
T*(Hall Benevolent Fund, of which he became President.[1] He was an early member )Tj
T*(of the entertainment charity Grand Order of Water Rats, which helps performers )Tj
T*(who are in financial need, and served as its leader, the King Rat, in 1891, )Tj
T*(1892 and 1897.[33] Near the end of his life, Leno co-founded The Music Hall )Tj
T*(Artistes Railway Association, which entered a partnership with the Water Rats )Tj
T*(to form music hall's first trade union.[86] Some of Leno's charity was discreet )Tj
T*(and unpublicised.[87] )Tj
T*( In the late 1890s, Leno formed a cricket team called the "Dainties", for which )Tj
T*(he recruited many of the day's leading comedians and music hall stars.[88] They )Tj
T*(played for charity against a variety of amateur teams willing to put up with )Tj
T*(their comedic mayhem, such as London's Metropolitan Police Force; Leno's and )Tj
T*(his teammates' tomfoolery on the green amused the large crowds that they )Tj
T*(drew.[89][90] From 1898 to 1903, the Dainties continued to play matches across )Tj
T*(London. Two films of action from the matches were produced in 1900 for )Tj
T*(audiences of the new medium of cinema. In September 1901, at a major charity )Tj
T*(match, the press noted the carnival atmosphere. The comedians wore silly )Tj
T*(costumesÂ â€“ Leno was dressed as an undertaker and later as a schoolgirl riding a )Tj
T*(camel. Bands played, and clowns circulated through the crowd. The rival team of )Tj
T*(professional Surrey cricketers were persuaded to wear tall hats during the )Tj
T*(match. 18,000 spectators attended, contributing funds for music hall and )Tj
T*(cricketers' charities, among others.[90][91] )Tj
T*( [edit] Decline and mental breakdown )Tj
T*( Leno began to drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, like his father )Tj
T*(and stepfather before him, he had become an alcoholic.[1] He gradually declined )Tj
T*(physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that )Tj
T*(began to affect his work.[92] By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour )Tj
T*(directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once )Tj
T*(composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic.[92] His erratic behaviour )Tj
T*(was often a result of his diminishing ability to remember his lines and )Tj
T*(inaudibility in performance.[1] Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which )Tj
T*(eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of )Tj
T*(Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a )Tj
T*(tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in )Tj
T*(1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on )Tj
T*(behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner )Tj
T*(service. Leno rose to his feet and said: "Governor, it's a magnificent present! )Tj
T*(I congratulate you and you deserve it!"[92] )Tj
T*( Frustrated at not being accepted as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed with )Tj
T*(the idea of playing Richard III and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating )Tj
T*(the actorâ€“manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree with his proposals.[1] After his final )Tj
T*(run of Mother Goose at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno's delusions )Tj
T*(overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he )Tj
T*(travelled to the home of Constance Collier, who was Beerbohm Tree's leading )Tj
T*(lady at His Majesty's Theatre, and also followed her to rehearsal there.[93] He )Tj
T*(attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that )Tj
T*(Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier )Tj
T*(a jewellery box holding a diamond-encrusted plaque. Recognising that Leno was )Tj
T*(having a mental breakdown, she sadly and gently refused his offer, and Leno )Tj
T*(left distraught.[93] )Tj
T*( Two days later, he was admitted into an asylum for the insane.[94] Leno spent )Tj
T*(several months in Camberwell House Asylum, London, under the care of Dr. )Tj
T*(Savage, who treated Leno with "peace and quiet and a little water )Tj
T*(colouring".[95] On his second day, Leno told a nurse that the clock was wrong. )Tj

T*(When she stated that it was right, Leno remarked, "Well if it's right, then )Tj
T*(what's it doing here?" Leno made several attempts to leave the asylum, twice )Tj
T*(being successful. He was found each time and promptly returned.[96] )Tj
T*( [edit] Last year and death )Tj
T*( Upon Leno's release from the institution in October 1903, the press offered )Tj
T*(much welcoming commentary and speculated as to whether he would appear that )Tj
T*(year in the Drury Lane's pantomime, scheduled to be Humpty Dumpty. Concerned )Tj
T*(that Leno might suffer a relapse, Arthur Collins employed Marie Lloyd to take )Tj
T*(his place.[97] By the time of rehearsals, however, Leno persuaded Collins that )Tj
T*(he was well enough to take part, and the cast was reshuffled to accommodate )Tj
T*(him. Leno appeared with success. Upon hearing his signature song, the audience )Tj
T*(reportedly gave him a standing ovation that lasted five minutes.[98] He )Tj
T*(received a telegram from the King congratulating him on his performance.[99] )Tj
T*(Leno's stage partner Herbert Campbell died in July 1904, shortly after the )Tj
T*(pantomime, following an accident at the age of fifty-seven. The death affected )Tj
T*(Leno deeply, and he went into a decline. At that time, he was appearing at the )Tj
T*(London Pavilion, but the show had to be cancelled owing to his inability to )Tj
T*(remember his lines.[92] So harsh were the critics that Leno wrote a statement, )Tj
T*(published in The Era, to defend the show's originality.[100] On 20 October )Tj
T*(1904, Leno gave his last performance in the show. Afterwards, he stopped at the )Tj
T*(Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington to leave a donation of Â£625 )Tj
T*(\(Â£49,765 in 2013 adjusted for inflation\).[24][101] )Tj
T*( Leno died at his home in London on 31 October 1904, aged 43, and was buried at )Tj
T*(Lambeth cemetery, Tooting.[102][103] The cause of death is not known.[n 6] His )Tj
T*(death and funeral were national news. The Daily Telegraph wrote in its )Tj
T*(obituary: "There was only one Dan. His methods were inimitable; his face was )Tj
T*(indeed his fortuneÂ ... Who has seen him in any of his disguises and has failed )Tj
T*(to laugh?"[104]Max Beerbohm later said of Leno's death: "So little and frail a )Tj
T*(lantern could not long harbour so big a flame".[105] His memorial is maintained )Tj
T*(by the Grand Order of Water Rats, which commissioned the restoration of his )Tj
T*(grave in 2004.[106][n 7] )Tj

T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The first two specimens of Eremoryzomys polius were collected by Wilfred )Tj
T*(Osgood and M.P. Anderson in 1912. The next year, Osgood described these animals )Tj
T*(as a new species in the genus Oryzomys, Oryzomys polius.[3] Osgood wrote that )Tj
T*(he was unable to find any species closely related to O.Â polius and compared it )Tj
T*(with O.Â xanthaeolus \(currently Aegialomys xanthaeolus\) "for convenience".[6] )Tj
T*(Its relationships remained obscure ever afterward and it was never assigned to )Tj
T*(any of the several groups of species recognized within Oryzomys.[7] )Tj
T*( In 2006, Marcelo Weksler published a large-scale cladistic analysis of )Tj
T*(Oryzomyini \("rice rats"\), the tribe to which O.Â polius belongs. He used both )Tj
T*(morphological data and molecular characters from the IRBP gene. In all of his )Tj
T*(analyses, O.Â polius was found to be part of clade D, one of four large groups )Tj
T*(within Oryzomyini, as the sister group to a clade containing all the other )Tj
T*(species of clade D.[8] Clade D was supported by two shared derived )Tj
T*(\(synapomorphic\) molecular characters and by seven morphological )Tj
T*(synapomorphiesâ€”the tail has a different color above and below; the parietal )Tj
T*(bone extends to the side of the skull; the incisive foramina \(openings in the )Tj
T*(palate\) extend back between the first molars; the posterolateral palatal pits )Tj
T*(\(perforations of the palate near the third molars\) are complex; the )Tj
T*(sphenopalatine vacuities \(openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind )Tj
T*(the end of the palate\) are large; the pattern of the arterial circulation in )Tj
T*(the head is derived; and the posteroloph \(a crest at the back\) is present on )Tj
T*(the third upper molar. Two other molecular synapomorphies supported the clade )Tj
T*(of all members of clade D except O.Â polius, coupled with three morphological )Tj
T*(traitsâ€”in these species, but not in O.Â polius, the first upper molar has an )Tj
T*(additional small root at the outer \(labial\) side; the first lower molar has )Tj
T*(additional small roots; and the second upper molar has the mesoflexus \(one of )Tj
T*(the valleys between the cusps and crests\) divided in two.[9] )Tj
T*( In Weksler's analysis, species placed in Oryzomys did not form a coherent )Tj
T*(\(monophyletic\) group, but instead were found at various positions across the )Tj
T*(oryzomyine tree, and he suggested that most of these species, including O.Â )Tj
T*(polius, should be placed in new genera.[10] Later in 2006, Weksler and others )Tj
T*(described ten new genera for species formerly placed in Oryzomys,[11] including )Tj
T*(Eremoryzomys for polius; thus, the species is now known as Eremoryzomys )Tj
T*(polius.[4] In reference to its "isolated distribution", they incorporated the )Tj
T*(Greek word eremia "lonely place" into the generic name.[12] The 2008 IUCN Red )Tj
T*(List, citing Pacheco, commented that Eremoryzomys may in fact include more than )Tj
T*(one species.[1] In 2011, a new oryzomyine, Drymoreomys albimaculatus, was )Tj
T*(described from southeastern Brazil, and phylogenetic analysis of morphological )Tj
T*(and molecular data suggested that this animal is the closest known relative of )Tj
T*(Eremoryzomys.[13] )Tj
T*( Eremoryzomys is now one of about 28 genera[11] in the tribe Oryzomyini, which )Tj
T*(includes well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, )Tj
T*(including nearby islands such as the GalÃ¡pagos Islands and some of the )Tj
T*(Antilles. Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily )Tj
T*(Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America )Tj
T*(and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily )Tj
T*(of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, )Tj
T*(hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Eremoryzomys polius is a large, long-tailed rice rat that in color resembles )Tj
T*(some North American woodrats \(Neotoma\).[3] The fur is grayish above and lighter )Tj
T*(below, where the hairs are gray at the bases but white at the tips. The )Tj
T*(external ears \(pinnae\) are short and the tail is dark above and light )Tj
T*(below.[12] The hindfeet have well-developed ungual tufts \(patches of hair\) )Tj
T*(along the plantar margins and between all of the digits, a character shared )Tj
T*(only with Sooretamys angouya among oryzomyines.[15] The squamae, small )Tj
T*(structures resembling scales that cover the soles of the hindfeet in many )Tj
T*(oryzomyines, are well developed. The claw of the first digit extends nearly to )Tj
T*(the end of the first phalanx of the second toe and the claw of the fifth toe )Tj

T*(extends slightly beyond the first phalanx of the fourth toe.[4] As in most )Tj
T*(oryzomyines, the female has eight mammae.[16] Head and body length is 138 to )Tj
T*(164Â mm \(5.4 to 6.5Â in\).[17] In Osgood's original two specimens, an old female )Tj
T*(and an adult female, tail length is 188 and 180Â mm \(7.4 and 7.1Â in\), )Tj
T*(respectively; hindfoot length is 30 and 30Â mm \(1.2 and 1.2Â in\); and greatest )Tj
T*(skull length is 37 and 34.7Â mm \(1.5 and 1.37Â in\).[3]Eremoryzomys polius has 12Â )Tj
T*(thoracic, 7 or 8Â lumbar, and 35 or 36Â caudal vertebrae;[18] the presence of 12Â )Tj
T*(thoracic vertebrae is a putative synapomorphy of Oryzomyini.[19] )Tj
T*( In the skull, the rostrum \(front part\) is long and robust. The nasal bones are )Tj
T*(short, not extending further back than the lacrimals,[4] and the premaxillaries )Tj
T*(extend about as far back as the nasals.[20] The zygomatic notch, an extension )Tj
T*(at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is )Tj
T*(level with the front of the first upper molar.[4] A strong jugal bone is )Tj
T*(present in the zygomatic arch \(cheekbone\), so that the maxillary and squamosal )Tj
T*(bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not )Tj
T*(overlap when seen from the side.[fn 1] The narrowest part of the interorbital )Tj
T*(region \(located between the eyes\) is to the front and the region's margins )Tj
T*(exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, )Tj
T*(especially in old animals.[4] The parietal bones form part of the roof of the )Tj
T*(braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the )Tj
T*(braincase.[21] The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow )Tj
T*(and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet )Tj
T*(extensively.[22] )Tj
T*( The incisive foramina are very long, extending well between the molars. The )Tj
T*(posterolateral palatal pits are well-developed and recessed into a fossa )Tj
T*(\(depression\).[4] The bony palate is relatively short, with the mesopterygoid )Tj
T*(fossa extending forward to the end of the molar row or even between the third )Tj
T*(molars.[fn 2] The roof of the fossa is perforated by large sphenopalatine )Tj
T*(vacuities. Usually, an alisphenoid strut is present; this extension of the )Tj
T*(alisphenoid bone separates two foramina \(openings\) in the skull, the )Tj
T*(masticatoryâ€“buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorius. The condition )Tj
T*(of various grooves and foramina of the skull indicates that the pattern of the )Tj
T*(arterial circulation of the head is derived.[4] The subsquamosal fenestra, an )Tj
T*(opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, )Tj
T*(is large and the mastoid bone is perforated by a fenestra \(opening\).[23] The )Tj
T*(squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof )Tj
T*(of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.[24] )Tj
T*( In the mandible, the mental foramen, an opening in the mandible just before )Tj
T*(the first molar, opens to the outside, not upwards as in a few other )Tj
T*(oryzomyines.[25] The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of )Tj
T*(the chewing muscles, usually join into a single crest at a point below the )Tj
T*(first molar and do not extend forward beyond the molar.[26] There is no )Tj
T*(distinct capsular process of the lower incisor, a trait Eremoryzomys shares )Tj
T*(with only a few other oryzomyines.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Molars )Tj
T*( The molars are bunodont \(with the cusps higher than the connecting crests\) and )Tj
T*(brachydont \(low-crowned\).[28] On the upper first and second molar, the outer )Tj
T*(and inner valleys between the cusps and crests do not interpenetrate. Many )Tj
T*(accessory crests are present, including the mesolophs and mesolophids. The )Tj
T*(anterocone and anteroconid, the front cusps on the upper and lower first molar, )Tj
T*(are not divided into smaller outer and inner cusps.[12] Small accessory roots )Tj
T*(are absent from the molars, so that each of the three upper molars has two )Tj
T*(roots on the outer side and one on the inner side and each of the lower molars )Tj
T*(has one root at the front and one at the back.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and status )Tj
T*( As far as now known, Eremoryzomys polius is confined to a small area in )Tj
T*(central Peru, at an altitude of 760 to 2100Â m \(2490 to 6890Â ft\),[30] but the )Tj
T*(species may range more widely. It occurs in forest in the dry lowlands of the )Tj

T*( The history of Sheffield, a city in South Yorkshire, England, can be traced )Tj
T*(back to the founding of a settlement in a clearing beside the River Sheaf in )Tj
T*(the second half of the 1st millennium AD. The area now known as Sheffield had )Tj
T*(seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but significant growth )Tj
T*(in the settlements that are now incorporated into the city did not occur until )Tj
T*(the Industrial Revolution. )Tj
T*( Following the Norman conquest of England, Sheffield Castle was built to )Tj
T*(control the Saxon settlements and Sheffield developed into a small town, no )Tj
T*(larger than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted for )Tj
T*(the production of knives, and by 1600 it had become the main centre of cutlery )Tj
T*(production in England, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire. In )Tj
T*(the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident )Tj
T*(Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same )Tj
T*(time, the silver plating process which produced Sheffield Plate was discovered. )Tj
T*(The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was )Tj
T*(incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893. )Tj
T*( Sheffield remained a major industrial city throughout the first half of the )Tj
T*(20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, )Tj
T*(technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching )Tj
T*(rationalisation in steel production throughout the European Economic Community )Tj
T*(led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban )Tj
T*(and economic regeneration schemes, initiated in the late 1980s, have since )Tj
T*(transformed the city. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early history )Tj
T*( The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at )Tj
T*(Creswell Crags to the east of the city. Artefacts and rock art found in caves )Tj
T*(at this site have been dated by archaeologists to the late Upper Palaeolithic )Tj
T*(period, at least 12,800 years ago.[1][2] Other prehistoric remains found in )Tj
T*(Sheffield include a Mesolithic "house"â€”a circle of stones in the shape of a )Tj
T*(hut-base dating to around 8000 BC, found at Deepcar, in the northern part of )Tj
T*(the city.[3] )Tj
T*( During the Bronze Age \(about 1500 BC\) tribes sometimes called the Urn people )Tj
T*(started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples of )Tj
T*(which can be found on Moscar Moor, Froggatt Edge and Hordron Edge \(Hordron Edge )Tj
T*(stone circle\). Two Early Bronze Age urns were found at Crookes in 1887,[4][5] )Tj
T*(and three Middle Bronze Age barrows found at Lodge Moor[6] \(both suburbs of the )Tj
T*(modern city\). )Tj
T*( In the Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine )Tj
T*(tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC are thought )Tj
T*(to have constructed the hill fort that stands on the summit of a steep hill )Tj
T*(above the River Don at Wincobank, in what is now northeastern Sheffield.[5] )Tj
T*(Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the )Tj
T*(southwest of Sheffield,[7] and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham. The rivers )Tj
T*(Sheaf and Don may have formed the boundary between the territory of the )Tj
T*(Brigantes and that of a rival tribe called the Corieltauvi who inhabited a )Tj
T*(large area of the northeastern Midlands.[8] )Tj

T*(rule in the early 70s.[10] Few Roman remains have been found in the Sheffield )Tj
T*(area. A minor Roman road linking the Roman forts at Templeborough and )Tj
T*(Brough-on-Noe possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern )Tj
T*(city,[11] and Icknield Street is thought to have skirted its )Tj
T*(boundaries.[12][13] The routes of these roads within this area are mostly )Tj
T*(unknown, although sections of the former can still be seen between Redmires and )Tj
T*(Stanage,[12][14] and remains possibly linked to the latter were discovered in )Tj
T*(Brinsworth in 1949.[15][16] In April 1761, tablets dating from the Roman period )Tj
T*(were found in the Rivelin Valley south of Stannington, close to the likely )Tj
T*(course of the Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe road. In addition there have been )Tj
T*(finds dating from the Roman period on Walkley Bank Road, which leads onto the )Tj
T*(valley bottom.[n 1] There have been small finds of Roman coins throughout the )Tj
T*(Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891,[18] 13 )Tj
T*(in Pitsmoor in 1906,[19] and ten coins were found at a site alongside Eckington )Tj
T*(cemetery in December 2008.[20] Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street )Tj
T*(near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along with the name of the old lane behind the )Tj
T*(church \(Campo Lane[n 2]\), has led to speculation that there may have been a )Tj
T*(Roman camp at this site.[n 3] However, it is unlikely that the settlement that )Tj
T*(grew into Sheffield existed at this time. )Tj
T*( Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the )Tj
T*(southern part of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet,[21] with the rivers Sheaf and Don )Tj
T*(forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of )Tj
T*(Mercia.[22] Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. )Tj
T*(The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the )Tj
T*(7th century,[21] however, an enduring Celtic presence within this area is )Tj
T*(evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffieldâ€”the )Tj
T*(word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.[n 4] )Tj
T*( [edit] The origins of Sheffield )Tj
T*( The name Sheffield is Old English in origin.[23] It derives from the River )Tj
T*(Sheaf, whose name is a corruption of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or )Tj
T*(separate.[24]Field is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English feld, )Tj
T*(meaning a forest clearing.[25] It is likely then that the origin of the )Tj
T*(present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement in a clearing beside )Tj
T*(the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded sometime between the arrival )Tj
T*(of the Anglo-Saxons in this region \(roughly the 6th century\) and the early 9th )Tj
T*(century.[26] The names of many of the other areas of Sheffield likely to have )Tj
T*(been established as settlements during this period end in ley, which signifies )Tj
T*(a clearing in the forest, or ton, which means an enclosed farmstead.[27] These )Tj
T*(settlements include Heeley, Longley, Norton, Owlerton, Southey, Tinsley, )Tj
T*(Totley, Wadsley, and Walkley. )Tj
T*( The earliest evidence of this settlement is thought to be the shaft of a stone )Tj
T*(cross dating from the early 9th century[28] that was found in Sheffield in the )Tj
T*(early 19th century. This shaft may be part of a cross removed from the church )Tj
T*(yard of the Sheffield parish church \(now Sheffield Cathedral\) in 1570.[29] It )Tj
T*(is now kept in the British Museum.[30] A document from around the same time, an )Tj
T*(entry for the year 829 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, refers to the submission )Tj
T*(of King Eanred of Northumbria to King Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore )Tj
T*(\(now a suburb of Sheffield\): "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as )Tj
T*(far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, )Tj
T*(on the acceptance of which they returned home". This event made Egbert the )Tj
T*(first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England.[31] )Tj
T*( The latter part of the 9th century saw a wave of Norse \(Viking\) settlers and )Tj
T*(the subsequent establishment of the Danelaw. The names of hamlets established )Tj
T*(by these settlers often end in thorpe, which means a farmstead.[32] Examples of )Tj
T*(such settlements in the Sheffield area are Grimesthorpe, Hackenthorpe, )Tj
T*(Jordanthorpe, Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Waterthorpe, and Woodthorpe.[33] By )Tj
T*(918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to Edward the Elder, and by 926 )Tj

T*(unknown, but some historians[34][35] have suggested a location between Tinsley )Tj

T*(After the death of King Athelstan in 939 Olaf III Guthfrithson invaded again )Tj

T*(Anglo-Saxons, under Edmund, re-conquered the Midlands, as far as Dore, in 942, )Tj
T*(and captured Northumbria in 944. )Tj
T*( The Domesday Book of 1086, which was compiled following the Norman Conquest of )Tj

T*(as the manor of "Hallun" \(or Hallam\). This manor retained its Saxon lord, )Tj
T*(Waltheof, for some years after the conquest. The Domesday Book was ordered )Tj
T*(written by William the Conqueror so that the value of the townships and manors )Tj

T*(Ad gld. Ibi hb Walleff com aula...)Tj
T*(  Translated it reads: )Tj
T*( LANDS OF ROGER DE BUSLI)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In Hallam, one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine carucates )Tj
T*([~14 km2] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an "Aula" [hall or court]. There )Tj
T*(may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the )Tj
T*(Countess Judith. He has himself there two carucates [~1 km2] and thirty-three )Tj
T*(villeins hold twelve carucates and a half [~6 km2]. There are eight acres )Tj
T*([32,000 m2] of meadow, and a pasturable wood, four leuvae in length and four in )Tj
T*(breadth [~10 km2]. The whole manor is ten leuvae in length and eight broad [207 )Tj
T*(km2]. In the time of Edward the Confessor it was valued at eight marks of )Tj
T*(silver [Â£5.33]; now at forty shillings [Â£2.00].)Tj
T*(In Attercliffe and Sheffield, two manors, Sweyn had five carucates of land )Tj
T*([~2.4 km2] to be taxed. There may have been about three ploughs. This land is )Tj
T*(said to have been inland, demesne [domain] land of the manor of Hallam.)Tj
T*(  The reference is to Roger de Busli, tenant-in-chief in Domesday and one of )Tj
T*(the greatest of the new wave of Norman magnates. Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria )Tj
T*(had been executed in 1076 for his part in an uprising against William I. He was )Tj
T*(the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls still remaining in England a full decade )Tj
T*(after the Norman conquest. His lands had passed to his wife, Judith of )Tj
T*(Normandy, niece to William the Conqueror. The lands were held on her behalf by )Tj
T*(Roger de Busli. )Tj
T*( The Domesday Book refers to Sheffield twice, first as Escafeld, then later as )Tj
T*(Scafeld. Sheffield historian S. O. Addy suggests that the second form, )Tj
T*(pronounced Shaffeld, is the truer form,[24] as the spelling Sefeld is found in )Tj
T*(a deed issued less than one hundred years after the completion of the survey.[n )Tj
T*(5] Addy comments that the E in the first form may have been mistakenly added by )Tj
T*(the Norman scribe. )Tj
T*( Roger de Busli died around the end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a )Tj
T*(son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de )Tj
T*(Lovetot, the grandson of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the )Tj
T*(Conqueror.[36] William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at )Tj
T*(Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield at the )Tj
T*(start of the 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also )Tj
T*(built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the )Tj
T*(town.[12][26] )Tj
T*( Also dating from this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert )Tj
T*(FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas )Tj
T*(Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated )Tj

T*( Following the death of William de Lovetot, the manor of Hallamshire passed to )Tj
T*(his son Richard de Lovetot and then his son William de Lovetot before being )Tj
T*(passed by marriage to Gerard de Furnival in about 1204.[39] The de Furnivals )Tj
T*(held the manor for the next 180 years.[40] The fourth Furnival lord, Thomas de )Tj
T*(Furnival, supported Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War. As a result of )Tj
T*(this, in 1266 a party of barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north )Tj
T*(Lincolnshire to Derbyshire passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, )Tj
T*(burning the church and castle.[26] A new stone castle was constructed over the )Tj
T*(next four years and a new church was consecrated by William II Wickwane the )Tj
T*(Archbishop of York around 1280. In 1295 Thomas de Furnival's son \(also Thomas\) )Tj
T*(was the first lord of Hallamshire to be called to Parliament, thus taking the )Tj
T*(title Lord Furnivall.[41] On 12 November 1296 Edward I granted a charter for a )Tj
T*(market to be held in Sheffield on Tuesday each week. This was followed on 10 )Tj
T*(August 1297 by a charter from Lord Furnival establishing Sheffield as a free )Tj
T*(borough.[42][43] The Sheffield Town Trust was established in the Charter to the )Tj
T*(Town of Sheffield, granted in 1297. De Furnival, granted land to the )Tj
T*(freeholders of Sheffield in return for an annual payment, and a Common Burgery )Tj
T*(administrated them. The Burgery originally consisted of public meetings of all )Tj
T*(the freeholders,[44] who elected a Town Collector.[45] Two more generations of )Tj
T*(Furnivals held Sheffield before it passed by marriage to Sir Thomas Nevil and )Tj
T*(then, in 1406, to John Talbot, the first Earl of Shrewsbury.[40] )Tj
T*( In 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church building was pulled down and )Tj
T*(replaced. Parts of this new church still stand today and it is now Sheffield )Tj
T*(city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of Sheffield )Tj
T*(Cathedral.[46] Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the )Tj
T*(Old Queen's Head pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its )Tj
T*(timber frame still intact, and Bishops' House and Broom Hall, both built around )Tj
T*(1500.[47] )Tj
T*( The fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, George Talbot took up residence in Sheffield, )Tj
T*(building the Manor Lodge outside the town in about 1510 and adding a chapel to )Tj
T*(the Parish Church c1520 to hold the family vault. Memorials to the fourth and )Tj
T*(sixth Earls of Shrewsbury can still be seen in the church.[48] In 1569 George )Tj
T*(Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, was given charge of Mary, Queen of Scots. )Tj
T*(Mary was regarded as a threat by Elizabeth I, and had been held captive since )Tj
T*(her arrival in England in 1568.[49] Talbot brought Mary to Sheffield in 1570, )Tj
T*(and she spent most of the next 14 years imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and its )Tj
T*(dependent buildings. The castle park extended beyond the present Manor Lane, )Tj
T*(where the remains of Manor Lodge are to be found. Beside them is the Turret )Tj
T*(House, an Elizabethan building, which may have been built to accommodate the )Tj
T*(captive queen. A room, believed to have been the queen's, has an elaborate )Tj
T*(plaster ceiling and overmantle, with heraldic decorations.[50] During the )Tj
T*(English Civil War, Sheffield changed hands several times, finally falling to )Tj
T*(the Parliamentarians, who demolished the Castle in 1648. )Tj
T*( The Industrial Revolution brought large-scale steel making to Sheffield in the )Tj
T*(18th century. Much of the mediaeval town was gradually replaced by a mix of )Tj
T*(Georgian and Victorian buildings. Large areas of Sheffield's city centre have )Tj
T*(been rebuilt in recent years, but among the modern buildings, some old )Tj
T*(buildings have been retained. )Tj
T*( [edit] Industrial Sheffield )Tj
T*( Sheffield's situationâ€”amongst a number of fast-flowing rivers and streams )Tj
T*(surrounded by hills containing raw materials such as coal, iron ore, ganister, )Tj
T*(and millstone grit for grindstonesâ€”made it an ideal place for water-powered )Tj
T*(industries to develop.[51]Water wheels were often built for the milling of )Tj
T*(corn, but many were converted to the manufacture of blades. As early as the )Tj
T*(14th century Sheffield was noted for the production of knives: )Tj

T*( In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock maker in Handsworth, invented a form )Tj
T*(of the crucible steel process for making a better quality of steel than had )Tj
T*(previously been available.[54] At around the same time Thomas Boulsover )Tj
T*(invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot )Tj
T*(producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate.[55] In )Tj
T*(1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office.[56] In the late 18th century, )Tj
T*(Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was )Tj
T*(invented in the town.[57] )Tj
T*( Huntsman's process was only made obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's )Tj
T*(invention of the Bessemer converter. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers )Tj
T*(to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was )Tj
T*(driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he )Tj
T*(erected steelworks in Sheffield.[58] Gradually the scale of production was )Tj
T*(enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally )Tj
T*(became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer &amp; Co. was underselling them to )Tj
T*(the extent of Â£20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at )Tj
T*(Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum. )Tj
T*( In 1857 Sheffield Football Club was formed, As of 2012[update] the world's )Tj
T*(oldest association football club. This saw a rapid growth of football teams in )Tj
T*(the area. )Tj
T*( Stainless steel was discovered by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth )Tj
T*(Laboratories in Sheffield.[59] His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr )Tj
T*(William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless )Tj
T*(steel',[60] which to this day is probably the widest-used alloy of this )Tj
T*(type.[61] )Tj
T*( These innovations helped Sheffield to gain a worldwide recognition for the )Tj
T*(production of cutlery; utensils such as the bowie knife were mass produced and )Tj
T*(shipped to the United States. The population of the town increased rapidly. In )Tj
T*(1736 Sheffield and its surrounding hamlets held about 7000 people,[62] in 1801 )Tj
T*(there were around 60,000 inhabitants, and by 1901, the population had grown to )Tj
T*(451,195.[63] )Tj
T*( This growth spurred the reorganisation of the governance of the town. Prior to )Tj
T*(1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the )Tj
T*(Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility for the improvement of )Tj
T*(streets and bridges. By the 19th century, however, both organisations lacked )Tj
T*(funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure.[44] The Church )Tj
T*(Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to )Tj
T*(Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal )Tj

T*(was defeated.[44] but the idea of a Commission was revived in 1810, and later )Tj
T*(in the decade Sheffield finally followed the model adopted by several other )Tj
T*(towns in petitioning for an Act to establish an Improvement Commission. This )Tj
T*(eventually led to the Sheffield Improvement Act 1818, which established the )Tj
T*(Commission and included a number of other provisions.[44] In 1832 the town )Tj
T*(gained political representation with the formation of a Parliamentary borough. )Tj
T*(A municipal borough was formed by an Act of Incorporation in 1843, and this )Tj
T*(borough was granted the style and title of "City" by Royal Charter in 1893.[64] )Tj
T*( From the mid-18th century, a succession of public buildings were erected in )Tj
T*(the town. St Paul's Church, now demolished, was among the first, while the old )Tj
T*(Town Hall and the present Cutlers' Hall were among the major works of the 19th )Tj
T*(century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks )Tj
T*(Company, who built a number of reservoirs around the town. Parts of Sheffield )Tj
T*(were devastated when, following a five year construction project, the Dale Dyke )Tj
T*(dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the Great Sheffield Flood. )Tj
T*( Sheffield's transport infrastructure was also improved.[n 6] In the 18th )Tj
T*(century turnpike roads were built connecting Sheffield with Barnsley, Buxton, )Tj
T*(Chesterfield, Glossop, Intake, Penistone, Tickhill, and Worksop.[n 7] In 1774 a )Tj
T*(2-mile \(3.2Â km\) wooden tramway was laid at the Duke of Norfolk's Nunnery )Tj
T*(Colliery. The tramway was destroyed by rioters, who saw it as part of a plan to )Tj
T*(raise the price of coal.[65] A replacement tramway, laid by John Curr in 1776, )Tj
T*(that used L-shaped rails was one of the earliest cast-iron railways.[66] The )Tj
T*(Sheffield Canal opened in 1819 allowing the large-scale transportation of )Tj
T*(freight.[67] This was followed by the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway in 1838, )Tj
T*(the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845, and the )Tj
T*(Midland Railway in 1870.[68] The Sheffield Tramway was started in 1873 with the )Tj
T*(construction of a horse tram route from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe. This )Tj
T*(route was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley, and further routes were )Tj
T*(constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge.[69] Due to the narrow )Tj
T*(medieval roads the tramways were initially banned from the town centre. An )Tj
T*(improvement scheme was passed in 1875; Pinstone Street and Leopold Street were )Tj
T*(constructed by 1879, and Fargate was widened in the 1880s. The 1875 plan also )Tj
T*(called for the widening of High Street, but disputes with property owners )Tj
T*(delayed this until 1895.[70] )Tj
T*( Steel production in the 19th century involved long working hours, in )Tj
T*(unpleasant conditions that offered little or no safety protection. Friedrich )Tj
T*(Engels in his The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 described )Tj
T*(the conditions prevalent in the city at that time: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(In Sheffield wages are better, and the external state of the workers also. On )Tj
T*(the other hand, certain branches of work are to be noticed here, because of )Tj
T*(their extraordinarily injurious influence upon health. Certain operations )Tj
T*(require the constant pressure of tools against the chest, and engender )Tj
T*(consumption in many cases; others, file-cutting among them, retard the general )Tj
T*(development of the body and produce digestive disorders; bone-cutting for knife )Tj
T*(handles brings with it headache, biliousness, and among girls, of whom many are )Tj
T*(employed, anÃ¦mia. By far the most unwholesome work is the grinding of )Tj
T*(knife-blades and forks, which, especially when done with a dry stone, entails )Tj
T*(certain early death. The unwholesomeness of this work lies in part in the bent )Tj
T*(posture, in which chest and stomach are cramped; but especially in the quantity )Tj
T*(of sharp-edged metal dust particles freed in the cutting, which fill the )Tj
T*(atmosphere, and are necessarily inhaled. The dry grinders' average life is )Tj
T*(hardly thirty-five years, the wet grinders' rarely exceeds forty-five.[71])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Sheffield became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and )Tj
T*(agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and )Tj
T*(labour provoked the so-called 'Sheffield Outrages', which culminated in a )Tj
T*(series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The Sheffield )Tj
T*(Trades Council organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at which the United )Tj

T*( [edit] The 20th century to the present )Tj
T*( In 1914 Sheffield became a diocese of the Church of England,[73] and the )Tj
T*(parish church became a cathedral.[74] During World War I the Sheffield City )Tj
T*(Battalion suffered heavy losses at the Somme[75] and Sheffield itself was )Tj
T*(bombed by a German zeppelin.[76] The recession of the 1930s was only halted by )Tj
T*(the increasing tension as World War II loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield )Tj
T*(were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once )Tj
T*(war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In )Tj
T*(total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, however it was the heavy bombing over )Tj
T*(the nights of 12 December and 15 December 1940 \(now known as the Sheffield )Tj
T*(Blitz\) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost )Tj
T*(and numerous buildings were destroyed.[77] )Tj
T*( Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s saw many large scale developments in )Tj
T*(the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and a new system of roads, )Tj
T*(including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old )Tj
T*(slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill )Tj
T*(flats,[78] and the Gleadless Valley estate. )Tj
T*( Sheffield's traditional manufacturing industries \(along with those of many )Tj
T*(other areas in the UK\), declined during the 20th century.[79] )Tj
T*( The building of the Meadowhall shopping centre on the site of a former )Tj
T*(steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding )Tj
T*(the decline of the city centre.[80] Attempts to regenerate the city were )Tj
T*(kick-started by the hosting of the 1991 World Student Games[81] and the )Tj
T*(associated building of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don )Tj
T*(Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex. Sheffield began construction of a )Tj
T*(tram system in 1992, with the first section opening in 1994. Starting in 1995, )Tj
T*(the Heart of the City Project has seen a number of public works in the city )Tj
T*(centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Galleries )Tj
T*(opened in April 2001, and a 1970s town hall extension was demolished in 2002 to )Tj
T*(make way for the Winter Gardens, which opened on 22 May 2003. A number of other )Tj
T*(projects grouped under the title Sheffield One aim to regenerate the whole of )Tj
T*(the city centre. )Tj
T*( On 25 June 2007, flooding caused millions of pounds worth of damage to )Tj
T*(buildings in the city and led to the loss of two lives.[82] )Tj

T*( Pieter Kenyon Fleming-Voltelyn van der Byl, ID \(11 November 1923 â€“ 15 November )Tj
T*(1999\) was a South African-born Rhodesian politician who served as the country's )Tj
T*(Foreign Minister from 1974 to 1979 as a member of the Rhodesian Front. A close )Tj
T*(associate of Prime Minister Ian Smith, van der Byl opposed attempts to )Tj
T*(compromise with the British authorities and domestic opposition on the issue of )Tj
T*(majority rule throughout most his time in government. However, in the late )Tj
T*(1970s he supported the moves which led to majority rule and internationally )Tj
T*(recognised independence for Zimbabwe. )Tj
T*( After a high-flying international education, van der Byl moved to the colony )Tj
T*(of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in )Tj
T*(the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a )Tj
T*(government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators )Tj
T*(for the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, van der Byl was afterwards )Tj
T*(responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his )Tj
T*(attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia as a new )Tj
T*(nation, but was popular among the members of his own party. )Tj
T*( Promoted to the cabinet in 1968, van der Byl became a spokesman for the )Tj
T*(Rhodesian government and crafted a public image as a die-hard supporter of )Tj
T*(continued white minority rule. In 1974 he was made Minister of Foreign Affairs )Tj
T*(and Defence at a time when Rhodesia's one ally, South Africa, was supplying )Tj
T*(military aid. His extreme views and brusque manner made him a surprising choice )Tj
T*(for a diplomat \(a Times profile in November 1976 described him as "a man )Tj
T*(calculated to give offence"[1]\). After offending the South African government, )Tj
T*(van der Byl was removed from the Defence Ministry. )Tj
T*( In the late 1970s van der Byl was willing to endorse the Smith government's )Tj
T*(negotiations with moderate African nationalist leaders and rejected attempts by )Tj
T*(international missions to broker an agreement. He served in the internal )Tj
T*(settlement government in 1979. After the creation of Zimbabwe, van der Byl )Tj
T*(remained involved in politics and close to Ian Smith, and he loudly attacked )Tj
T*(former Smith supporters who had gone over to support Robert Mugabe. He retired )Tj
T*(to South Africa when the Mugabe government abolished seats reserved for whites )Tj
T*(in Parliament. )Tj
T*( [edit] Family and early life )Tj
T*( Van der Byl was born in Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa, the son of )Tj
T*(Major Pieter Voltelyn Graeme van der Byl, a member of Jan Smuts' South African )Tj

T*(were interrupted by war in 1941.[3] He served with the South African Army )Tj
T*(during the Second World War[2] and was briefly attached to the British 7th )Tj
T*(Queen's Own Hussars;[1] he saw active service in the Middle East, Italy and )Tj
T*(Austria. )Tj
T*( After being demobilised, van der Byl studied law at Pembroke College, )Tj
T*(Cambridge[4] where his aristocratic manner stood out. "P. K." was always )Tj
T*(elegantly dressed and coiffured, and acquired the nickname "the Piccadilly )Tj
T*(Dutchman". He obtained a Third-class degree in his Part II Law examinations in )Tj
T*(1947,[5] and went on from Cambridge to study at the Harvard University Graduate )Tj
T*(School of Business Administration from 1947 to 1948 \(although he did not obtain )Tj
T*(a degree at the latter\).[6] He also studied at the University of Witwatersrand )Tj
T*(in South Africa.[7] )Tj
T*( One of the most conspicuous features of van der Byl was his manner of speech: )Tj
T*(although his ancestry was Cape Dutch and his early life was in Cape Town, South )Tj
T*(Africa, he had what were described \(by the pro-Rhodesian Chris Whitehead\) as )Tj
T*("what he thought was an aristocratic English nasal drawl and imperial English )Tj
T*(mannerisms".[8] Whitehead was of the opinion that van der Byl had "adopted" )Tj
T*(this accent, in common with others who heard him.[9] This personal )Tj
T*(characteristic was intensely irritating to many people including South African )Tj
T*(government ministers, but van der Byl's aristocratic mannerisms appeared )Tj
T*(uncontentious to many Rhodesian whites. They believed that his "nasal drawl" )Tj
T*(was the product of his time as an officer in the Hussars and his Cambridge )Tj
T*(education: William Higham described him as "a popular Minister of Defence who, )Tj
T*(despite his British upper crust accent â€“ undoubtedly honed during his )Tj
T*(swashbuckling career as an officer in the hussars â€“ hailed from a noble Cape )Tj
T*(family."[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Move to Rhodesia )Tj
T*( Van der Byl moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1950 in order to manage some of his )Tj
T*(family's tobacco farming interests, hoping to make his own fortune.[3] He )Tj
T*(welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: )Tj
T*(in that year in Angola he set a world record for the biggest elephant shot )Tj
T*(which stood until 1955.[11] )Tj
T*( In 1957 van der Byl was made a Director of the United Dominions Corporation )Tj
T*(\(Rhodesia\) Ltd, having already become an active member of the Rhodesia Tobacco )Tj
T*(Association. In 1956, he was elected by the members of the Selousâ€“Gadzema )Tj
T*(district to represent them on the Tobacco Association council. He was also )Tj
T*(Deputy Chair of the Selous Farmers' Association in 1957. His first involvement )Tj
T*(in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of )Tj
T*(their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he )Tj
T*(served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the Rhodesia Tobacco )Tj
T*(Association on the council of the Rhodesian National Farmers Union.[12] He was )Tj
T*(recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers.[2] )Tj
T*( Dominion Party politician Winston Field had also led the Rhodesia Tobacco )Tj
T*(Association, and van der Byl agreed with him on politics in general. He joined )Tj
T*(the Rhodesian Front when it was set up under Field's leadership. At the 1962 )Tj
T*(general election, van der Byl was elected comfortably to the Rhodesia House of )Tj
T*(Assembly for the Hartley constituency, a rural area to the south-west of )Tj
T*(Salisbury.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Political career )Tj
T*( [edit] Ministerial office )Tj
T*( In 1963, Winston Field appointed van der Byl as a junior government whip,[12] )Tj

T*(Justice with responsibility for the Information Service.[14] Although the van )Tj
T*(der Byl family were identified as strongly Liberal in South African politics, )Tj
T*(he became identified with the right wing of the party and helped to depose )Tj
T*(Field from the premiership in early April 1964, when Field failed to persuade )Tj
T*(the British government to grant Southern Rhodesia its independence. The new )Tj
T*(Prime Minister, Ian Smith, appointed him Deputy Minister for Information.[14] )Tj

T*(was plotting to overthrow white rule in Rhodesia.[15] )Tj
T*( Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on 12 August 1964 he attacked proposals )Tj
T*(for greater independence for broadcasters by referring to what he perceived to )Tj
T*(be the social effect in Britain: )Tj
T*( To suggest that the BBC, forming opinion in the minds of the people of )Tj
T*(England, has been an influence for good in any way, when you consider the )Tj
T*(criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, )Tj
T*(and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings )Tj
T*(which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last )Tj
T*(fifteen to twenty years, the Hon. Member can hardly bring that up as an )Tj
T*(argument in favour of the freedom of broadcasting.[16])Tj
T*(  By the end of 1964, van der Byl and his Ministry had control of broadcasting )Tj
T*(in Rhodesia.[15] Speaking in Parliament he described the aims of his Department )Tj
T*(as "not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but )Tj
T*(to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country". )Tj
T*(He defined propaganda as "simply the propagation of the faith and the belief in )Tj
T*(any particular ideology or thing", and also stated that the Department would )Tj
T*(seek the "resuscitation of the determination of the European to survive and )Tj
T*(fight for his rights".[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] 1965 election )Tj
T*( In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front government went to the country in a general )Tj
T*(election with van der Byl one of the leading campaigners. Discussion of )Tj
T*(unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that )Tj
T*(only a small fraction of Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign )Tj
T*(speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in )Tj
T*(politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive )Tj
T*(Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and )Tj
T*(the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big )Tj
T*(business.[18] )Tj
T*( The Rhodesian Front won a landslide victory, winning every single one of the )Tj
T*(50 constituencies which had predominantly European voters. At the Rhodesian )Tj
T*(Front Congress of August 1965, party members strongly attacked the press for )Tj
T*(failing to support the government. A demand for it to be made compulsory for )Tj
T*(all political articles to be signed by the author met with van der Byl's )Tj
T*(approval.[19] )Tj
T*( Within the government, van der Byl was one of the loudest voices urging Ian )Tj
T*(Smith to proceed to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He angrily )Tj
T*(denounced the threat of sanctions from Britain, saying on 4 May 1965 that )Tj
T*(economic destruction of Rhodesia would mean total economic destruction of )Tj
T*(Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia. This statement was interpreted as a )Tj
T*(military threat by David Butler, the Leader of the Opposition.[20] Van der Byl )Tj
T*(was given the task of selling the UDI to Rhodesian whites and to world opinion. )Tj
T*(In September 1965, it was announced that he would tour the United Kingdom to )Tj
T*(promote Rhodesian independence. According to David Steel, he claimed then that )Tj
T*(France and the United States would lead the international recognition of the )Tj
T*(UDI government.[21] He was appointed Deputy Minister of Information on 22 )Tj
T*(October[22] and so was present at, but did not sign, the Unilateral Declaration )Tj
T*(of Independence Document on 11 November 1965. )Tj
T*( Van der Byl was greeted by a speech strongly critical of the Rhodesian )Tj
T*(government from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, who supported the )Tj
T*(use of armed force to bring the Rhodesians in line with United Kingdom policy )Tj
T*(on decolonization. He responded by comparing the speech to "the tragic )Tj
T*(connivance at the destruction of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the useless )Tj
T*(appeasement at Munich in 1938".[23] Van der Byl's response used the phrase )Tj
T*("kith and kin" to refer to the ethnic links between the white Rhodesians and )Tj
T*(the people of the United Kingdom. He saw no contradiction between signing a )Tj
T*(letter declaring "constant loyalty" to the Queen and declaring independence a )Tj
T*(few days later;[11] the Rhodesian Government was careful at the time of UDI to )Tj
T*(state its continued loyalty to the British Crown, though it later declared a )Tj
T*(Republic. )Tj

T*( Despite his enthusiasm for propaganda, van der Byl was outraged when the BBC )Tj
T*(subsequently set up a radio station at Francistown in Botswana which broadcast )Tj
T*(for 27 months, criticising UDI and urging Rhodesians to revoke it. He was later )Tj
T*(to claim the station was inciting violence,[24] although this was denied by )Tj
T*(those who had been regular listeners.[25] On 26 January 1966, two months after )Tj
T*(the UDI, van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army )Tj
T*(troops would follow a "scorched earth" policy should the United Kingdom send in )Tj
T*(troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces )Tj
T*(invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. He was highly critical of Harold Wilson, )Tj
T*(describing him as a "highly dangerous, uninformed and conceited little )Tj
T*(man."[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Censorship )Tj
T*( Internally, his policy was enforced through Ministry control of TV and radio )Tj
T*(and through censorship of newspapers. From 31 December 1965, the Ministry of )Tj
T*(Information expanded its brief and was renamed the Ministry of Information, )Tj
T*(Immigration and Tourism, which meant that it was also responsible for deciding )Tj
T*(whether to grant or revoke permits to visit Rhodesia. Several foreign )Tj
T*(journalists were expelled: John Worrall, correspondent for The Guardian, went )Tj
T*(in January 1969. The Rhodesia Herald, then in opposition to both the Rhodesian )Tj
T*(Front and UDI, frequently appeared with large white spaces on its news pages )Tj
T*(where censored stories had been placed. Stories and editorials personally )Tj
T*(critical of van der Byl were immediately removed. )Tj
T*( Censorship was tightened still further on 8 February 1966 when it was made )Tj
T*(illegal to indicate where material had been removed. The censor was also given )Tj
T*(the power to alter existing material or to move it around the newspaper. Dr )Tj
T*(Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, described the powers as "censorship )Tj
T*(gone mad", and insisted that there would no longer be any guarantee that )Tj
T*(anything published in the newspapers was authentic. Van der Byl responded by )Tj
T*(saying that the new measures were a reflection on the newspapers which had made )Tj
T*(such powers necessary.[27] In 1967 van der Byl was reported by Malcolm Smith, )Tj
T*(the former editor of the Herald, as remarking that a high degree of )Tj
T*(self-censorship was required, and support for the government was essential.[28] )Tj
T*( The Herald \(and the Bulawayo Chronicle\) defied the restrictions, boldly )Tj
T*(printing blank spaces which identified removed material. Van der Byl personally )Tj
T*(visited the newspaper offices on the day the new regulations came in to warn )Tj
T*(the staff that if the paper was printed as proposed, they would "publish at )Tj
T*(your peril." However the papers continued to appear with identifiable )Tj
T*(censorship in defiance of the government, and in 1968 the regulations were )Tj
T*(scrapped. )Tj
T*( [edit] Deportation )Tj
T*( Shortly after UDI, 46 academics working at University College, a racially )Tj
T*(non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, )Tj
T*(denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited many )Tj
T*(of those who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the )Tj
T*(residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which would )Tj
T*(normally be automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. )Tj
T*(Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason )Tj
T*(was his opposition to UDI.[29] )Tj
T*( Van der Byl's strategy seemed to work at home, with many Rhodesians remaining )Tj
T*(unaware until the end just how much was their country's vulnerability and )Tj
T*(isolation. The Times was later to describe him as a "skilled propagandist who )Tj
T*(believed his own propaganda."[11] When sanctions on Rhodesia were confirmed in )Tj
T*(January 1967, van der Byl compared their situation with Spain following World )Tj
T*(War II, saying that the isolation of Spain had not stopped it from becoming one )Tj
T*(of the most advanced and economically successful countries in Europe. However, )Tj
T*(the reality of the situation must have been brought home to van der Byl in )Tj
T*(April 1966 when he made informal approaches to see if he might visit Britain )Tj
T*("for social reasons" during a tour of Europe. The Commonwealth Relations Office )Tj
T*(replied that he would not be recognised as enjoying any form of recognition or )Tj
T*(immunity.[30] Other European governments refused to recognise his passport and )Tj

T*(expelled him from the country.[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Wider role in politics )Tj
T*( On 13 September 1968 he was promoted to be the full Minister of Information, )Tj
T*(Immigration and Tourism. Van der Byl's aristocratic background, military )Tj
T*(experience and academic credentials combined to give him an almost iconic )Tj
T*(status within the Rhodesian Front. Many were impressed by his exploits as a )Tj
T*(big-game hunter, which began when he shot his first lion in a garden in )Tj
T*(Northern Rhodesia at the age of 15.[11] He was also known to be a patron of the )Tj
T*(arts in public and a womaniser in private.[citation needed] Many in the )Tj
T*(Rhodesian Front believed him to be "a 19th century-style connoisseur, a man of )Tj
T*(culture and an aristocrat-statesman" in the words of Michael Hartnack, a South )Tj
T*(African journalist.[32] Hartnack went on to observe "Poseurs are an incipient )Tj
T*(hazard in any unsophisticated society." Within the somewhat claustrophobic )Tj
T*(confines of white Rhodesian society outside the RF, van der Byl was achieving )Tj
T*(some degree of respect. )Tj
T*( In politics he assumed the position of hard-line opponent of any form of )Tj
T*(compromise with domestic opponents or the international community. He made )Tj
T*(little secret of his willingness to succeed Ian Smith as Prime Minister if )Tj
T*(Smith showed even "the least whiff of surrender," and did his best to )Tj
T*(discourage attempts to get the Rhodesians to compromise. When Abel Muzorewa had )Tj
T*(his passport withdrawn in September 1972 after returning from a successful )Tj
T*(visit to London, the government did not attempt to counter the rumour that it )Tj
T*(action was taken following van der Byl's personal order.[33] )Tj
T*( In April 1972 van der Byl sparked a row over the agreement which Rhodesia and )Tj
T*(the United Kingdom had made in November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia )Tj
T*(had agreed to certain concessions to African nationalism in return for the )Tj
T*(prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the )Tj
T*(agreement was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the )Tj
T*(settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl )Tj
T*(insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless )Tj
T*(Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from )Tj
T*(the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European )Tj
T*(population of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, )Tj
T*(the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the )Tj
T*(government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported )Tj
T*(against it.[34] )Tj
T*( His derision of working class British Labour politicians also caused problems. )Tj
T*(When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and )Tj
T*(punched while attempting to address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, van )Tj
T*(der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to coordinate )Tj
T*(the visit, and pointed out that they were breaking the law which required )Tj
T*(government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.[35] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ... the most ignorant and offensive person in authority whom I have ever met. )Tj
T*(A false Englishman in the manner of von Richthofen. Against elections, against )Tj
T*(everything except intrigue and condescension. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The propaganda circulated by his Ministry \(typically including references to )Tj
T*("happy, smiling natives"\) was considered laughable. Visiting British journalist )Tj
T*(Peregrine Worsthorne, who knew van der Byl socially, reported seeing a copy of )Tj
T*(Mein Kampf on his coffee table.[37] His propaganda strategy became increasingly )Tj
T*(unsuccessful abroad, where van der Byl alienated many of the foreign )Tj
T*(journalists and politicians that he came into contact with. Max Hastings, then )Tj
T*(reporting for the Evening Standard, described him as "appalling" and said that )Tj
T*(he and Smith "would have seemed ludicrous figures, had they not possessed the )Tj
T*(power of life and death over millions of people"; van der Byl had him )Tj

T*( While still popular with the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the )Tj
T*(1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in improving Rhodesia's image )Tj
T*(around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept )Tj
T*(on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new )Tj
T*(Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting )Tj
T*(Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the )Tj
T*(Bill for the composition of the proposed board, which was dominated by strong )Tj

T*( [edit] Minister of Defence )Tj
T*( Van der Byl was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August )Tj
T*(1974. These were two distinct portfolios, the first of which \(Foreign Affairs\) )Tj
T*(did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international )Tj
T*(recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into )Tj
T*(civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience )Tj
T*(had been largely in the area of public relations, he was now charged with )Tj
T*(responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia. )Tj

T*( Van der Byl attempts to inspire the Rhodesian troops[40] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( He promoted aggressive measures against the insurgents, and in so doing, he )Tj
T*(also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored )Tj
T*(battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing )Tj
T*(dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech for the )Tj
T*(benefit of the troops and the TV cameras â€“ then return to Salisbury in time for )Tj
T*(dinner. He drew heavily on Winston Churchill's oratory style for some of his )Tj
T*(inspiring speeches.[7][41] As Minister of Defence, van der Byl was known to )Tj
T*(join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle \(with )Tj
T*(the words "I'd like to bag one of these chaps ..."\), and would regularly visit )Tj
T*(army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of "scotch )Tj
T*(whisky and fine wines." Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was )Tj
T*(far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, )Tj
T*(Jack Howman. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the )Tj
T*(South African and Rhodesian governments. )Tj
T*( Rhodesia's strategic position underwent a fundamental change in June 1975 when )Tj
T*(the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered )Tj
T*(Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied )Tj
T*(government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South )Tj
T*(Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main )Tj
T*(road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira )Tj
T*(and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians )Tj
T*(continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were )Tj
T*(allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia. )Tj
T*( There were rumours in February 1976 that Soviet tanks were being unloaded in )Tj
T*(Mozambique to help in the war. Unluckily for van der Byl, the British Foreign )Tj
T*(Office minister was David Ennals, one of those who had received rough treatment )Tj
T*(in 1966. Ennals announced that in the event of a racial war breaking out in )Tj
T*(Rhodesia, there would be no British help. Van der Byl responded by claiming )Tj
T*(this indicated Britain accepting Rhodesia's independence.[42] He attacked Abel )Tj
T*(Muzorewa for supporting President Machel, saying that "being a good churchman )Tj
T*(and a Bishop there is a very strong possibility he might be a communist".[43] )Tj

T*( Following the example of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments )Tj
T*(permitted guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and )Tj
T*(infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that this had to be )Tj
T*(expected.[44] As infiltration grew, he declared at the beginning of July that )Tj
T*(the Rhodesian Army would not hesitate to bomb and destroy villages that )Tj
T*(harboured guerillas.[45] )Tj
T*( In 1975 and 1976, the South African government conducted delicate negotiations )Tj
T*(with neighbouring states: the South Africans wanted to encourage those states )Tj
T*(to maintain economic relations with South Africa and Rhodesia while limiting )Tj
T*(the activities of the ANC, ZANU and ZAPU. However, increasingly aggressive )Tj
T*(actions by the Rhodesian army outside its own borders resulted in the failure )Tj
T*(of this conciliatory approach. )Tj
T*( A cross-border Selous Scouts raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 \(dubbed )Tj
T*("the Nyadzonya Raid"\) killed over 1,000 people without Rhodesian fatalities, )Tj
T*(with van der Byl insisting that the government had irrefutable proof that the )Tj
T*(raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the )Tj
T*(nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation )Tj
T*(into the raid.[46] The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of )Tj
T*(intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were )Tj
T*(not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed )Tj
T*(guerrillas, though there were some civilians present.[n 1] In a successful )Tj
T*(attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had been full of )Tj
T*(unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian )Tj
T*(raid as a massacre.[47] Although cross-border raids into Mozambique had been )Tj
T*(approved by the Rhodesian cabinet, the depth and severity of the August )Tj
T*(incursion was greater than had been intended. Van der Byl had sanctioned the )Tj
T*(incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the )Tj
T*(incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African )Tj
T*(government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were )Tj
T*(compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this )Tj
T*("the final straw" as far as van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Foreign affairs )Tj
T*( Van der Byl took over at a time when South Africa was putting increasing )Tj
T*(pressure on the Rhodesians to make an agreement on majority rule. In March )Tj
T*(1975, he had to fly urgently to Cape Town to explain why the Rhodesian )Tj
T*(government had detained Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of the Zimbabwe African )Tj
T*(National Union, who was improbably accused of plotting to murder his )Tj
T*(colleagues. The South Africans were extremely displeased with this action and )Tj
T*(suspected that the real reason was that the Rhodesians objected to Sithole and )Tj
T*(preferred to negotiate with Joshua Nkomo.[49] Van der Byl was unsuccessful in )Tj
T*(reassuring the South Africans and Ian Smith was forced to follow him. )Tj
T*( Gradually the South Africans grew unwilling to help Rhodesia. The remaining )Tj
T*(200 South African policemen transferred to help in the guerilla war were )Tj
T*(removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more )Tj
T*(disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted )Tj
T*(that "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who )Tj
T*(invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a )Tj
T*(much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They are here to represent a )Tj
T*(force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South )Tj
T*(Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, )Tj
T*(Europe and the rest of the western world."[50] )Tj
T*( When the Rhodesian government held talks with the African National Council on )Tj
T*(the railway bridge across the Victoria Falls in August 1975 \(the train in which )Tj
T*(the talks took place was strategically in the middle of the bridge so that the )Tj
T*(ANC were in Zambia while the Rhodesians remained in Rhodesia\), van der Byl was )Tj
T*(not a member of the Rhodesian delegation. This was a curious omission given his )Tj
T*(position. He did however participate in talks with Joshua Nkomo that December. )Tj
T*( Van der Byl's habit of referring to the African population as "munts" \(he )Tj
T*(asserted that "Rhodesia is able to handle the munts"[51]\) led to extreme )Tj
T*(unpopularity with the South African government, and he did not attend talks )Tj

T*(interpreted as being connected to a personal dislike. When, on 26 August 1976, )Tj
T*(the South African government announced the withdrawal of all its military )Tj
T*(helicopter crews from Rhodesia, van der Byl was outspoken in his criticism and )Tj
T*(Vorster was reported to have refused to have anything to do with "that dreadful )Tj
T*(man van der Byl."[2] Smith decided that he "clearly ... had no option"[52] and )Tj
T*(on 9 September 1976 executed a sudden cabinet reshuffle that ended van der )Tj
T*(Byl's tenure as Defence Minister. Smith claimed the South African dislike of )Tj
T*(van der Byl was partly motivated by the memory of his father, who had been in )Tj
T*(opposition to the National Party.[52] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contribution to diplomacy )Tj
T*( As the prominence of the issue of Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, )Tj
T*(attention on van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable )Tj
T*(lines at press conferences \(such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian )Tj

T*("It's an academic question, because they are normally dead"[1]\). While )Tj
T*(negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the )Tj
T*(Geneva Conference in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as )Tj
T*("this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" and the Patriotic Front proposals as "almost )Tj
T*(a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective".[53] Mugabe )Tj
T*(repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one )Tj
T*(occasion van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( At this conference, which was organised by Britain with American support, van )Tj
T*(der Byl rejected the idea of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a )Tj
T*(transition to majority rule, which was identified as one of the few ways of )Tj
T*(persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement.[56] The conference was )Tj
T*(adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December )Tj
T*(1976,[57] and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they )Tj
T*(would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate )Tj
T*(black rule were made the only topic for discussion.[58] Soon after, on 7 )Tj
T*(January 1977, van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of )Tj
T*(every proposal made in Geneva.[59] )Tj
T*( Later that month, van der Byl was finding pressure put on him by more moderate )Tj
T*(voices within Rhodesia and hinted that the government might amend the Land )Tj
T*(Tenure Act, which effectively split the country into sections reserved for each )Tj
T*(racial group. He also remarked that Bishop Abel Muzorewa "can be said to )Tj
T*(represent the African in this country",[60] which indicated the direction in )Tj
T*(which the Smith government was hoping to travel: an accommodation with moderate )Tj
T*(voices within Rhodesia was likely to be a better end than a capitulation to the )Tj
T*(Patriotic Front. Van der Byl was prepared to support this strategy and did not )Tj
T*(go along with the 12 Rhodesian Front MPs who formed the Rhodesian Action Party )Tj
T*(in early 1977 claiming that the Front had not adhered to party principles. )Tj
T*( Although van der Byl was now prepared to say that he supported the transition )Tj
T*(to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in )Tj
T*(April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a "very )Tj
T*(qualified franchiseâ€”that's what the whole thing is about", and also said that )Tj

T*(the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the )Tj
T*(Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.[62] )Tj
T*( However, the Rhodesian government was forced to put its internal settlement )Tj
T*(negotiations on hold during a joint US-UK initiative in late 1977. Van der )Tj
T*(Byl's public comments seemed to be aimed at ensuring this mission did not )Tj
T*(succeed, as he insisted that it had no chance of negotiating a ceasefire, )Tj
T*(described the Carter administration as "mindless", and the joint mission as )Tj
T*(being "Anglo-American-Russian".[63] When a plan was published, he described it )Tj
T*(as "totally outrageous" and involving "the imposition of unconditional )Tj
T*(surrender on an undefeated people who are not enemies".[64] )Tj
T*( [edit] Internal settlement )Tj
T*( The mission did fail and the internal settlement talks were resurrected, )Tj
T*(resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers )Tj
T*(was set up, with van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his )Tj
T*(co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this )Tj
T*(accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family )Tj
T*(friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April )Tj
T*(1978[65] after van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas )Tj
T*(denied to other reporters.[66] )Tj
T*( In May van der Byl greeted news of massacres in Zaire as "a blessing in )Tj
T*(disguise" because they might ensure that warnings about Soviet penetration in )Tj
T*(Africa were heeded.[67] He denounced the British government the following month )Tj
T*(for refusing to recognise that a massacre of Elim missionaries was perpetrated )Tj
T*(by the Patriotic Front.[68] As the date for the full implementation of the )Tj
T*(internal settlement grew nearer, van der Byl's profile decreased, but he )Tj
T*(remained active in politics: he was elected unopposed for the whites-only )Tj
T*(Gatooma/Hartley seat to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia House of Assembly. He handed over )Tj
T*(power to his African successor on 1 June 1979, and became instead Minister of )Tj
T*(Transport and Power and Minister of Posts in the new government. )Tj
T*( [edit] Lancaster House )Tj
T*( When "the wheels came off the wagon" \(as he put it\)[2] at Lancaster House in )Tj
T*(1979, van der Byl greeted the event with amused detachment. He was not a member )Tj
T*(of any delegation at the conference and did not attend. The weekend after the )Tj
T*(agreement, he called on the Rhodesian Front to revitalise itself as the only )Tj
T*(true representative of Europeans in Rhodesia,[69] and he ascribed the result of )Tj
T*(the conference to "a succession of perfidious British governments".[70] )Tj
T*( According to Ian Smith's memoirs, van der Byl organised a meeting between Ian )Tj
T*(Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, )Tj
T*(shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they )Tj
T*(agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning.[71] They met again on 26 )Tj
T*(February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The )Tj
T*(consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win )Tj
T*(enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which )Tj
T*(were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election )Tj
T*(results in March dented this confidence. )Tj
T*( Smith asked Walls for details of his plan \("Operation Quartz"\)[72] for using )Tj
T*(force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls )Tj
T*(insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both )Tj
T*(Smith and van der Byl believed that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe )Tj
T*(taking over. Walls took the view that it was already too late, and while the )Tj
T*(others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.[71] )Tj
T*( [edit] In Zimbabwe )Tj
T*( Van der Byl had been elected unopposed to the new House of Assembly for )Tj
T*(Gatooma/Hartley and remained a close associate of Smith, becoming Vice )Tj
T*(President of the 'Republican Front' \(later renamed the Conservative Alliance of )Tj
T*(Zimbabwe\). At the 1985 general election the boundaries for the White Roll seats )Tj
T*(were altered and van der Byl fought in Mount Pleasant, opposing Chris )Tj

T*(in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his )Tj
T*(seemingly mesmeric personality, flowing hair, and otherworldly dress earned him )Tj
T*(a prophet-like reputation in the West. His "elegant prose and magical poetry" )Tj
T*(remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse )Tj

T*(long-lost classics. He graduated to his first short stories and dramasâ€”and the )Tj

T*(and strident anti-nationalist he denounced the Raj and advocated independence )Tj
T*(from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast )Tj

T*( Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting )Tj

T*(spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali \(Song Offerings\), Gora )Tj
T*(\(Fair-Faced\), and Ghare-Baire \(The Home and the World\) are his best-known )Tj

T*(left Calcutta in February 1873 for a months-long tour of the Raj. They visited )Tj
T*(his father's Santiniketan estate and rested in Amritsar en route to the )Tj
T*(Himalayan Dhauladhars, their destination being the remote hill station at )Tj
T*(Dalhousie. Along the way, Tagore read biographies; his father tutored him in )Tj
T*(history, astronomy, and Sanskrit declensions. He read biographies of Benjamin )Tj
T*(Franklin among other figures; they discussed Edward Gibbon's The History of the )Tj
T*(Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; and they examined the poetry of KÄlidÄsa. )Tj
T*(In mid-April they reached the station, and at 2,300 metres \(7,546Â ft\) they )Tj
T*(settled into a house that sat atop Bakrota Hill. Tagore was taken aback by the )Tj
T*(region's deep green gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls. )Tj
T*(They stayed there for several months and adopted a regime of study and )Tj
T*(privation that included daily twilight baths taken in icy water. )Tj
T*( He returned to Jorosanko and completed a set of major works by 1877, one of )Tj
T*(them a long poem in the Maithili style of Vidyapati; they were published )Tj
T*(pseudonymously. Regional experts accepted them as the lost works of BhÄnusimha, )Tj
T*(a newly discoveredÎ¶[â€º] 17th-century Vaishnava poet. He debuted the short-story )Tj

T*(was forbidden to leave it for any purpose other than traveling to school. He )Tj

T*(University College London, but again left school. He opted instead for )Tj
T*(independent study of Shakespeare, Religio Medici, Coriolanus, and Antony and )Tj
T*(Cleopatra. Lively English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes impressed Tagore, )Tj
T*(whose own tradition of Nidhubabu-authored kirtans and tappas and Brahmo hymnody )Tj
T*(was subdued. In 1880 he returned to Bengal degree-less, resolving to reconcile )Tj
T*(European novelty with Brahmo traditions, taking the best from each. In 1883 he )Tj
T*(married Mrinalini Devi, born Bhabatarini, 1873â€“1902; they had five children, )Tj
T*(two of whom died in childhood. )Tj
T*( In 1890 Tagore began managing his vast ancestral estates in Shelaidaha \(today )Tj
T*(a region of Bangladesh\); he was joined by his wife and children in 1898. Tagore )Tj
T*(released his Manasi poems \(1890\), among his best-known work. As Zamindar Babu, )Tj
T*(Tagore criss-crossed the riverine holdings in command of the Padma, the )Tj
T*(luxurious family barge. He collected mostly token rents and blessed villagers )Tj
T*(who in turn honoured him with banquetsâ€”occasionally of dried rice and sour )Tj
T*(milk. He met Gagan Harkara, through whom he became familiar with Baul Lalon )Tj
T*(Shah, whose folk songs greatly influenced Tagore.[42] Tagore worked to )Tj
T*(popularise Lalon's songs. The period 1891â€“1895, Tagore's Sadhana period, named )Tj
T*(after one of Tagore's magazines, was his most productive; in these years he )Tj
T*(wrote more than half the stories of the three-volume, 84-story Galpaguchchha. )Tj
T*(Its ironic and grave tales examined the voluptuous poverty of an idealised )Tj
T*(rural Bengal. )Tj
T*( Santiniketan: 1901â€“1932 )Tj
T*( In 1901 Tagore moved to Santiniketan to found an ashram with a marble-floored )Tj
T*(prayer hallâ€”The Mandirâ€”an experimental school, groves of trees, gardens, a )Tj
T*(library. There his wife and two of his children died. His father died in 1905. )Tj
T*(He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income from the )Tj
T*(Maharaja of Tripura, sales of his family's jewelry, his seaside bungalow in )Tj
T*(Puri, and a derisory 2,000 rupees in book royalties. He gained Bengali and )Tj
T*(foreign readers alike; he published Naivedya \(1901\) and Kheya \(1906\) and )Tj
T*(translated poems into free verse. In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won )Tj
T*(that year's Nobel Prize in Literature: the Swedish Academy appreciated the )Tj
T*(idealisticâ€”and for Westernersâ€”accessible nature of a small body of his )Tj
T*(translated material focussed on the 1912 Gitanjali: Song Offerings. In 1915, )Tj
T*(the British Crown granted Tagore a knighthood. He renounced it after the 1919 )Tj
T*(Jallianwala Bagh massacre. )Tj
T*( In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist Leonard Elmhirst set up the )Tj
T*("Institute for Rural Reconstruction", later renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of )Tj
T*(Welfare", in Surul, a village near the ashram. With it, Tagore sought to )Tj
T*(moderate Gandhi's Swaraj protests, which he occasionally blamed for British )Tj
T*(India's perceived mentalâ€”and thus ultimately colonialâ€”decline. He sought aid )Tj
T*(from donors, officials, and scholars worldwide to "free village[s] from the )Tj
T*(shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalis[ing] knowledge". In the )Tj
T*(early 1930s he targeted ambient "abnormal caste consciousness" and )Tj
T*(untouchability. He lectured against these, he penned Dalit heroes for his poems )Tj
T*(and his dramas, and he campaignedâ€”successfullyâ€”to open Guruvayoor Temple to )Tj
T*(Dalits. )Tj
T*( Twilight years: 1932â€“1941 )Tj
T*( Tagore's life as a "peripatetic litterateur" affirmed his opinion that human )Tj
T*(divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the )Tj
T*(Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that "Our prophet has said that a true )Tj
T*(Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever )Tj
T*(come to any harm ..." Tagore confided in his diary: "I was startled into )Tj
T*(recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity." To the end Tagore )Tj
T*(scrutinised orthodoxyâ€”and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit )Tj
T*(Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic karma, as divine )Tj
T*(retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his )Tj
T*(seemingly ignominious inferences. He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta )Tj

T*( â€” Interviewed by Einstein, 14 April 1930. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Shortly after returning home the 63-year-old Tagore accepted an invitation )Tj
T*(from the Peruvian government. He travelled to Mexico. Each government pledged )Tj
T*(US$100,000 to his school to commemorate the visits. A week after his 6 November )Tj
T*(1924 arrival in Buenos Aires, an ill Tagore shifted to the Villa MiralrÃ­o at )Tj
T*(the behest of Victoria Ocampo. He left for home in January 1925. In May 1926 )Tj
T*(Tagore reached Naples; the next day he met Mussolini in Rome. Their warm )Tj
T*(rapport ended when Tagore pronounced upon Il Duce's fascist finesse. He had )Tj
T*(earlier enthused: "[w]ithout any doubt he is a great personality. There is such )Tj
T*(a massive vigour in that head that it reminds one of Michael Angeloâ€™s chisel." )Tj
T*(A "fire-bath" of fascism was to have educed "the immortal soul of Italy ... )Tj
T*(clothed in quenchless light". )Tj
T*( On 14 July 1927 Tagore and two companions began a four-month tour of Southeast )Tj
T*(Asia. They visited Bali, Java, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Siam, and )Tj
T*(Singapore. The resultant travelogues compose Jatri \(1929\). In early 1930 he )Tj
T*(left Bengal for a nearly year-long tour of Europe and the United States. Upon )Tj
T*(returning to Britainâ€”and as his paintings exhibited in Paris and Londonâ€”he )Tj
T*(lodged at a Birmingham Quaker settlement. He wrote his Oxford Hibbert )Tj
T*(LecturesÎ¹[â€º] and spoke at the annual London Quaker meet. There, addressing )Tj
T*(relations between the British and the Indiansâ€”a topic he would tackle )Tj
T*(repeatedly over the next two yearsâ€”Tagore spoke of a "dark chasm of aloofness". )Tj
T*(He visited Aga Khan III, stayed at Dartington Hall, toured Denmark, )Tj
T*(Switzerland, and Germany from June to mid-September 1930, then went on into the )Tj
T*(Soviet Union. In April 1932 Tagore, intrigued by the Persian mystic Hafez, was )Tj
T*(hosted by Reza Shah Pahlavi. In his other travels, Tagore interacted with Henri )Tj
T*(Bergson, Albert Einstein, Robert Frost, Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. )Tj
T*(Wells, and Romain Rolland. Visits to Persia and Iraq \(in 1932\) and Sri Lanka )Tj
T*(\(in 1933\) composed Tagore's final foreign tour, and his dislike of communalism )Tj
T*(and nationalism only deepened. Vice President of India M. Hamid Ansari has said )Tj
T*(that Rabindranath Tagore heralded the cultural rapprochement between )Tj
T*(communities, societies and nations much before it became the liberal norm of )Tj
T*(conduct. Tagore was a man ahead of his time. He wrote in 1932, while on a visit )Tj
T*(to Iran, that "each country of Asia will solve its own historical problems )Tj
T*(according to its strength, nature and needs, but the lamp they will each carry )Tj
T*(on their path to progress will converge to illuminate the common ray of )Tj
T*(knowledge."[86] His ideas on culture, gender, poverty, education, freedom, and )Tj
T*(a resurgent Asia remain relevant today. )Tj
T*( Works )Tj
T*( Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, )Tj
T*(travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short )Tj
T*(stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with )Tj
T*(originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently )Tj
T*(noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly )Tj
T*(borrow from deceptively simple subject matter: commoners. Tagore's non-fiction )Tj
T*(grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. )Tj
T*(His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, )Tj
T*(including Europe Jatrir Patro \(Letters from Europe\) and Manusher Dhormo \(The )Tj
T*(Religion of Man\). His brief chat with Einstein, "Note on the Nature of )Tj
T*(Reality", is included as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's )Tj
T*(150th birthday an anthology \(titled Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali\) of the )Tj
T*(total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in )Tj
T*(chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about )Tj
T*(eighty volumes.[88] In 2011, Harvard University Press collaborated with )Tj
T*(Visva-Bharati University to publish The Essential Tagore, the largest anthology )Tj
T*(of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by Fakrul Alam and Radha )Tj
T*(Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagoreâ€™s birth.[89] )Tj

T*( Music and art )Tj
T*( Tagore composed 2,230 songs and was a prolific painter. His songs compose )Tj
T*(rabindrasangit \("Tagore Song"\), which merges fluidly into his literature, most )Tj
T*(of whichâ€”poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alikeâ€”were lyricised. )Tj
T*(Influenced by the thumri style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut )Tj
T*(of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to )Tj
T*(quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal color of classical ragas to )Tj
T*(varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm )Tj
T*(faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ragas. Yet about )Tj
T*(nine-tenths of his work was not bhanga gaan, the body of tunes revamped with )Tj
T*("fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional )Tj
T*(flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral culture. Scholars have attempted )Tj
T*(to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani ragas: )Tj
T*(â€œ)Tj
T*([...] the pathos of the purabi raga reminded Tagore of the evening tears of a )Tj
T*(lonely widow, while kanara was the confused realization of a nocturnal wanderer )Tj
T*(who had lost his way. In bhupali he seemed to hear a voice in the wind saying )Tj
T*('stop and come hither'.Paraj conveyed to him the deep slumber that overtook one )Tj
T*(at nightâ€™s end.)Tj
T*(â€)Tj
T*(â€”Reba Som, Rabindranath Tagore: The Singer and His Song.)Tj
T*( Tagore influenced sitar maestro Vilayat Khan and sarodiyas Buddhadev Dasgupta )Tj
T*(and Amjad Ali Khan. His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali )Tj
T*(ethos to an extent perhaps rivaling Shakespeare's impact on the )Tj
T*(English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five )Tj
T*(centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. Dhan Gopal )Tj
T*(Mukerji has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and )Tj
T*(express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to )Tj
T*(allâ€”big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord )Tj
T*(air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose )Tj
T*(practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn )Tj
T*(severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh. )Tj
T*( For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive )Tj
T*(strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that )Tj
T*(the Modern Review observed that "[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where )Tj
T*(Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even )Tj
T*(illiterate villagers sing his songs". A. H. Fox Strangways of The Observer )Tj
T*(introduced non-Bengalis to rabindrasangit in The Music of Hindostan, calling it )Tj
T*(a "vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music )Tj
T*(to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize." )Tj
T*( In 1971, Amar Shonar Bangla became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was )Tj
T*(writtenâ€”ironicallyâ€”to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal )Tj
T*(lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was )Tj
T*(to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the )Tj
T*(independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar )Tj
T*(communalism. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised )Tj
T*(register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that )Tj
T*(Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian )Tj
T*(National Congress[95] and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of )Tj
T*(the Republic of India as its national anthem. )Tj
T*( At sixty, Tagore took up drawing and painting; successful exhibitions of his )Tj
T*(many worksâ€”which made a debut appearance in Paris upon encouragement by artists )Tj
T*(he met in the south of Franceâ€”were held throughout Europe. He was likely )Tj
T*(red-green color blind, resulting in works that exhibited strange colour schemes )Tj
T*(and off-beat aesthetics. Tagore was influenced by scrimshaw from northern New )Tj
T*(Ireland, Haida carvings from British Columbia, and woodcuts by Max Pechstein. )Tj
T*(His artist's eye for his handwriting were revealed in the simple artistic and )Tj
T*(rhythmic leitmotifs embellishing the scribbles, cross-outs, and word layouts of )Tj
T*(his manuscripts. Some of Tagore's lyrics corresponded in a synesthetic sense )Tj
T*(with particular paintings. )Tj

T*(Pratibha \(The Genius of Valmiki\). In it the pandit Valmiki overcomes his sins, )Tj

T*(Shyama are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together )Tj

T*( Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them Chaturanga, Shesher )Tj
T*(Kobita, Char Odhay, and Noukadubi. Ghare Baire \(The Home and the World\)â€”through )Tj
T*(the lens of the idealistic zamindar protagonist Nikhilâ€”excoriates rising Indian )Tj
T*(nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the Swadeshi movement; a frank )Tj
T*(expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged out of a 1914 bout of )Tj
T*(depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil'sâ€”likely )Tj
T*(mortalâ€”wounding. )Tj
T*( Gora raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with )Tj
T*(Ghare Baire, matters of self-identity \(jÄti\), personal freedom, and religion )Tj
T*(are developed in the context of a family story and love triangle. In it an )Tj
T*(Irish boy orphaned in the Sepoy Mutiny is raised by Hindus as the titular )Tj
T*(goraâ€”"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he chastises Hindu religious )Tj
T*(backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them )Tj
T*(against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his )Tj
T*(worried foster father to reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a )Tj
T*("true dialectic" advancing "arguments for and against strict traditionalism", )Tj
T*(it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value of all positions )Tj
T*(within a particular frame [...] not only syncretism, not only liberal )Tj
T*(orthodoxy, but the extremest reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal )Tj
T*(to what humans share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity [...] conceived )Tj
T*(of as dharma." )Tj
T*( In Jogajog \(Relationships\), the heroine Kumudiniâ€”bound by the ideals of )Tj
T*(Åšiva-Sati, exemplified by DÄkshÄyaniâ€”is torn between her pity for the sinking )Tj
T*(fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her )Tj
T*(roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; pathos depicts the )Tj
T*(plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family )Tj
T*(honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry. The )Tj
T*(story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two familiesâ€”the )Tj
T*(Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline \(Biprodas\) and the Ghosals )Tj
T*(\(Madhusudan\), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' )Tj
T*(sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had )Tj
T*(risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female )Tj
T*(relations. )Tj
T*( Others were uplifting: Shesher Kobitaâ€”translated twice as Last Poem and )Tj
T*(Farewell Songâ€”is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages )Tj
T*(written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism )Tj
T*(and has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of an old, )Tj
T*(outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar )Tj
T*(name: "Rabindranath Tagore". Though his novels remain among the )Tj
T*(least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film )Tj
T*(adaptations by Ray and others: Chokher Bali and Ghare Baire are exemplary. In )Tj

T*(who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning )Tj

T*( Tagore's three-volume Galpaguchchha comprises eighty-four stories that reflect )Tj
T*(upon the author's surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on mind )Tj
T*(puzzles. Tagore associated his earliest stories, such as those of the "Sadhana" )Tj
T*(period, with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these traits were )Tj
T*(cultivated by zamindar Tagoreâ€™s life in Patisar, Shajadpur, Shelaidaha, and )Tj
T*(other villages. Seeing the common and the poor, he examined their lives with a )Tj
T*(depth and feeling singular in Indian literature up to that point. In "The )Tj
T*(Fruitseller from Kabul", Tagore speaks in first person as a town dweller and )Tj
T*(novelist imputing exotic perquisites to an Afghan seller. He channels the )Tj
T*(lucubrative lust of those mired in the blasÃ©, nidorous, and sudorific morass of )Tj
T*(subcontinental city life: for distant vistas. "There were autumn mornings, the )Tj
T*(time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring )Tj
T*(from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole )Tj
T*(world. At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it [...] I )Tj
T*(would fall to weaving a network of dreams: the mountains, the glens, the forest )Tj
T*([...]." )Tj
T*( The Golpoguchchho \(Bunch of Stories\) was written in Tagore's Sabuj Patra )Tj
T*(period, which lasted from 1914 to 1917 and was named for another of his )Tj
T*(magazines. These yarns are celebrated fare in Bengali fiction and are commonly )Tj
T*(used as plot fodder by Bengali film and theatre. The Ray film Charulata echoed )Tj
T*(the controversial Tagore novella Nastanirh \(The Broken Nest\). In Atithi, which )Tj
T*(was made into another film, the little Brahmin boy Tarapada shares a boat ride )Tj
T*(with a village zamindar. The boy relates his flight from home and his )Tj
T*(subsequent wanderings. Taking pity, the elder adopts him; he fixes the boy to )Tj
T*(marry his own daughter. The night before his wedding, Tarapada runs offâ€”again. )Tj
T*(Strir Patra \(The Wife's Letter\) is an early treatise in female emancipation. )Tj
T*(Mrinal is wife to a Bengali middle class man: prissy, preening, and )Tj
T*(patriarchal. Travelling alone she writes a letter, which comprehends the story. )Tj
T*(She details the pettiness of a life spent entreating his viraginous virility; )Tj
T*(she ultimately gives up married life, proclaiming, Amio bachbo. Ei bachlum: )Tj
T*("And I shall live. Here, I live." )Tj
T*( Haimanti assails Hindu arranged marriage and spotlights their often dismal )Tj
T*(domesticity, the hypocrisies plaguing the Indian middle classes, and how )Tj
T*(Haimanti, a young woman, due to her insufferable sensitivity and free spirit, )Tj
T*(foredid herself. In the last passage Tagore blasts the reification of Sita's )Tj
T*(self-immolation attempt; she had meant to appease her consort Rama's doubts of )Tj
T*(her chastity. Musalmani Didi eyes recrudescent Hindu-Muslim tensions and, in )Tj
T*(many ways, embodies the essence of Tagore's humanism. The somewhat )Tj
T*(auto-referential Darpaharan describes a fey young man who harbours literary )Tj
T*(ambitions. Though he loves his wife, he wishes to stifle her literary career, )Tj
T*(deeming it unfeminine. In youth Tagore likely agreed with him. Darpaharan )Tj
T*(depicts the final humbling of the man as he ultimately acknowledges his wife's )Tj
T*(talents. As do many other Tagore stories, Jibito o Mrito equips Bengalis with a )Tj
T*(ubiquitous epigram: Kadombini moriya proman korilo she more naiâ€”"Kadombini )Tj
T*(died, thereby proving that she hadn't." )Tj
T*( Poetry )Tj
T*( Tagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and )Tj
T*(16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, )Tj
T*(visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of Vyasa )Tj
T*(and other rishi-authors of the Upanishads, the Bhakti-Sufi mystic Kabir, and )Tj
T*(Ramprasad Sen. Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure )Tj
T*(to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic Baul ballads such as those )Tj
T*(of the bard Lalon. These, rediscovered and repopularised by Tagore, resemble )Tj
T*(19th-century KartÄbhajÄ hymns that emphasise inward divinity and rebellion )Tj
T*(against bourgeois bhadralok religious and social orthodoxy. During his )Tj
T*(Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the moner manush, the )Tj
T*(BÄuls' "man within the heart" and Tagore's "life force of his deep recesses", )Tj
T*(or meditating upon the jeevan devataâ€”the demiurge or the "living God within". )Tj
T*(This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional )Tj
T*(interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his BhÄnusiá¹ƒha poems )Tj

T*(in Bengali literature by writing matching experimental works in the 1930s. )Tj
T*(These include Africa and Camalia, among the better known of his latter poems. )Tj
T*(He occasionally wrote poems using Shadhu Bhasha, a Sanskritised dialect of )Tj
T*(Bengali; he later adopted a more popular dialect known as Cholti Bhasha. Other )Tj
T*(works include Manasi, Sonar Tori \(Golden Boat\), Balaka \(Wild Geese, a name )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Tagore was renowned throughout much of Europe, North America, and East Asia. )Tj
T*(He co-founded Dartington Hall School, a progressive coeducational institution; )Tj
T*(in Japan, he influenced such figures as Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata. )Tj
T*(Tagore's works were widely translated into English, Dutch, German, Spanish, and )Tj
T*(other European languages by Czech indologist Vincenc LesnÃ½, French Nobel )Tj
T*(laureate AndrÃ© Gide, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, former Turkish Prime Minister )Tj
T*(BÃ¼lent Ecevit, and others. In the United States, Tagore's lecturing circuits, )Tj
T*(particularly those of 1916â€“1917, were widely attended and wildly acclaimed. )Tj
T*(Some controversiesÎ¸[â€º] involving Tagore, possibly fictive, trashed his )Tj
T*(popularity and sales in Japan and North America after the late 1920s, )Tj
T*(concluding with his "near total eclipse" outside Bengal. Yet a latent reverence )Tj
T*(of Tagore was discovered by an astonished Salman Rushdie during a trip to )Tj
T*(Nicaragua. )Tj
T*( By way of translations, Tagore influenced Chileans Pablo Neruda and Gabriela )Tj
T*(Mistral; Mexican writer Octavio Paz; and Spaniards JosÃ© Ortega y Gasset, )Tj
T*(Zenobia CamprubÃ­, and Juan RamÃ³n JimÃ©nez. In the period 1914â€“1922, the )Tj
T*(JimÃ©nez-CamprubÃ­ pair produced twenty-two Spanish translations of Tagore's )Tj
T*(English corpus; they heavily revised The Crescent Moon and other key titles. In )Tj
T*(these years, JimÃ©nez developed "naked poetry". Ortega y Gasset wrote that )Tj
T*("Tagore's wide appeal [owes to how] he speaks of longings for perfection that )Tj
T*(we all have [...] Tagore awakens a dormant sense of childish wonder, and he )Tj
T*(saturates the air with all kinds of enchanting promises for the reader, who )Tj
T*([...] pays little attention to the deeper import of Oriental mysticism". )Tj
T*(Tagore's works circulated in free editions around 1920â€”alongside those of )Tj
T*(Plato, Dante, Cervantes, Goethe, and Tolstoy. )Tj
T*( Tagore was deemed overrated by some. Graham Greene doubted that "anyone but )Tj
T*(Mr. Yeats can still take his poems very seriously." Several prominent Western )Tj
T*(admirersâ€”including Pound and, to a lesser extent, even Yeatsâ€”criticised )Tj
T*(Tagore's work. Yeats, unimpressed with his English translations, railed against )Tj
T*(that "Damn Tagore [...] We got out three good books, Sturge Moore and I, and )Tj
T*(then, because he thought it more important to know English than to be a great )Tj
T*(poet, he brought out sentimental rubbish and wrecked his reputation. Tagore )Tj
T*(does not know English, no Indian knows English."William Radice, who )Tj
T*("English[ed]" his poems, asked: "What is their place in world literature?" He )Tj
T*(saw him as "kind of counter-cultur[al]," bearing "a new kind of classicism" )Tj
T*(that would heal the "collapsed romantic confusion and chaos of the 20th )Tj

T*( The United States Assay Commission was an agency of the United States )Tj
T*(government from 1792 to 1980. Its function was to annually supervise the )Tj
T*(testing of the gold, silver, and \(in its final years\) base metal coins produced )Tj
T*(by the United States Mint to ensure that they met specifications. Although some )Tj
T*(members were designated by statute, for the most part the commission, which was )Tj
T*(freshly appointed each year, consisted of prominent Americans, including )Tj
T*(numismatists. Appointment to the Assay Commission was eagerly sought after, in )Tj
T*(part because commissioners received a commemorative medal. These medals, )Tj
T*(different each year, are extremely rare, with the exception of the 1977 issue )Tj
T*(which was sold to the general public. )Tj
T*( The Mint Act of 1792 authorized the Assay Commission. Beginning in 1797, it )Tj
T*(met in most years at the Philadelphia Mint. Each year, the President of the )Tj
T*(United States appointed unpaid members, who would gather in Philadelphia to )Tj
T*(ensure the weight and fineness of silver and gold coins issued the previous )Tj
T*(year were to specifications. In 1971, the commission met, but for the first )Tj
T*(time had no gold or silver to test, with the end of silver coinage. Beginning )Tj
T*(in 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed no members of the public to the )Tj
T*(commission, and in 1980, he signed legislation abolishing it. )Tj

T*(The remedy for errors in the weight and alloy of the coins, must necessarily )Tj
T*(form a part, in the system of a mint; and the manner of applying it will )Tj
T*(require to be regulated. The following account is given of the practice in )Tj
T*(England, in this particular: A certain number of pieces are taken promiscuously )Tj
T*(out of every fifteen pounds of gold, coined at the Mint, which are deposited, )Tj
T*(for safe keeping, in a strong box, called the pix [sic, more commonly "pyx"]. )Tj
T*(This box, from time to time, is opened in the presence of the Lord Chancellor, )Tj
T*(the officers of the Treasury, and others, and portions are selected from the )Tj
T*(pieces of each coinage, which are melted together, and the mass assayed by a )Tj
T*(jury of the Company of GoldsmithsÂ ... The expediency of some similar regulation )Tj
T*(seems to be manifest.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In response to Hamilton's report, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792. In )Tj
T*(addition to setting the standards for the new nation's coinage, Congress )Tj
T*(provided for an American version of the British Trial of the Pyx: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(That from every separate mass of standard gold or silver, which shall be made )Tj
T*(into coins at the said Mint, there shall be taken, set apart by the Treasurer )Tj
T*(and reserved in his custody a certain number of pieces, not less than three, )Tj
T*(and that once in every year the pieces so set apart and reserved, shall be )Tj
T*(assayed under the inspection of the Chief Justice of the United States, the )Tj
T*(Secretary and Comptroller of the Treasury, the Secretary for the Department of )Tj
T*(State, and the Attorney General of the United States, \(who are hereby required )Tj
T*(to attend for that purpose at the said Mint, on the last Monday in July in each )Tj
T*(year\)Â ... and if it shall be found that the gold and silver so assayed, shall )Tj
T*(not be inferior to their respective standards herein before declared more than )Tj
T*(one part in one hundred and forty-four parts, the officer or officers of the )Tj
T*(said Mint whom it may concern shall be held excusable; but if any greater )Tj
T*(inferiority shall appear, it shall be certified to the President of the United )Tj
T*(States, and the said officer or officers shall be deemed disqualified to hold )Tj
T*(their respective offices.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The following January, Congress passed legislation changing the date on which )Tj
T*(the designated officials met to the second Monday in February. No meetings took )Tj
T*(place; the Mint was not yet striking gold or silver. Minting of silver began in )Tj
T*(1794 and gold in 1795, and some coins were saved for assay: the first Mint )Tj
T*(document mentioning assay pieces is from January 1796 and indicates that )Tj
T*(exactly $80 in silver had been put aside. The first assay commissioners did not )Tj
T*(meet until Monday, March 20, 1797, a month later than the prescribed date.[4] )Tj
T*(Once they did, annual meetings took place each year until 1980, except in 1817 )Tj
T*(as there had been no gold or silver struck since the last meeting \(until 1837, )Tj
T*(the commission examined the coins since the last testing, rather than for a )Tj
T*(particular calendar year\). )Tj
T*( In 1801, the usual meeting was delayed, causing Mint Director Elias Boudinot )Tj
T*(to complain to President John Adams that depositors were anxious for an audit )Tj
T*(so the Mint could release coins struck from their bullion. Numismatist Fred )Tj
T*(Reed suggested that the delay was probably due to poor weather, making it )Tj
T*(difficult for officials to travel from the new capital of Washington, D.C., to )Tj
T*(Philadelphia for the assay.[4] In response, on March 3, 1801, Congress changed )Tj
T*(the officials required to attend to "the district judge of Pennsylvania, the )Tj
T*(attorney for the United States in the district of Pennsylvania, and the )Tj
T*(commissioner of loans for the State of Pennsylvania". The meeting finally took )Tj
T*(place on April 27, 1801. The 1806 and 1815 sessions were delayed because of )Tj
T*(outbreaks of sickness in Philadelphia; the one in 1812 was held a month late )Tj
T*(because of a heavy snowstorm which prevented the commissioners from reaching )Tj
T*(the Mint. No meeting took place in 1817; a fire had damaged the Philadelphia )Tj
T*(Mint in January 1816, and no gold or silver awaited the commission. In 1818, )Tj
T*(Congress substituted the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia for the )Tj
T*(Pennsylvania loans commissioner as a member of the Assay Commission. )Tj

T*( With the Coinage Act of 1834, Congress removed the automatic disqualification )Tj
T*(of Mint officers in the event of an unfavorable assay, leaving the decision to )Tj
T*(the president. The Mint Act of 1837 established the Assay Commission in the )Tj
T*(form it would have for most of the remainder of its existence. It provided that )Tj
T*("an annual trial shall be made of the pieces reserved for this purpose [i.e., )Tj
T*(set aside for the assay] at the Mint and its branches, before the judge of the )Tj
T*(district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, )Tj
T*(the attorney of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, )Tj
T*(and the collector of the port of Philadelphia, and such other persons as the )Tj
T*(President shall, from time to time, designate for that purpose, who shall meet )Tj
T*(as commissioners, for the performance of this duty, on the second Monday in )Tj
T*(February, annually". The usual procedure for members of the public to be named )Tj
T*(to the commission after public appointments began was for the Mint Director to )Tj
T*(send the president a list of candidates for his approval. )Tj
T*( In 1861, as the American Civil War broke out, North Carolina joined the )Tj
T*(Confederate States. The Charlotte Mint, taken over by the Confederacy, )Tj
T*(eventually closed as it used up all its dies and could obtain no more from )Tj
T*(Philadelphia. Nevertheless, 12Â half eagles \($5 gold coins\) were sent from )Tj
T*(Charlotte to Philadelphia, through enemy lines, in October 1861. They were duly )Tj
T*(tested by the 1862 Assay Commission, and were found to be correct.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later years \(1873â€“1949\) )Tj
T*( The Coinage Act of 1873 revised the laws relating to coinage and the Mint and )Tj
T*(retired several denominations including the two-cent piece. The act also )Tj
T*(changed the officers required to serve on the Assay Commission: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(That to secure a due conformity in the gold and silver coins to their )Tj
T*(respective standards of fineness and weight, the judge of the district court of )Tj
T*(the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, the Comptroller of )Tj
T*(the Currency, the assayer of the assay-office at New York, and such other )Tj
T*(persons as the President shall, from time to time, designate, shall meet as )Tj
T*(assay-commissioners, at the mint in Philadelphia, to examine and test, in the )Tj
T*(presence of the Director of the Mint, the fineness and weight of the coins )Tj
T*(reserved by the several mints for this purpose, on the second Wednesday in )Tj
T*(February, annually.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The act also required the Mint to put aside one of every thousand gold coins )Tj
T*(struck, and one of every two thousand silver coins for the assay. It provided )Tj
T*(the procedure for putting the coins aside, sealing them in envelopes, and )Tj
T*(placing them in a pyx to be opened by the assay commissioners. )Tj
T*( The 1881 Assay Commission found that approximately 3,000 silver dollars struck )Tj
T*(at the Carson City Mint \(1881-CC\) had been struck in .892 silver rather than )Tj
T*(the legally mandated .900. It is unclear if the Treasury took any steps to )Tj
T*(attempt to recover the issued pieces. The 1885 commission detected a single )Tj
T*(silver dollar which was 1.51 grains \(0.098 g\) below specifications, the )Tj
T*(permitted tolerance being 1.50 grains \(0.097Â g\).[16] In 1921, the Assay )Tj
T*(Commission found that some coins struck at the Denver Mint were struck in .905 )Tj
T*(or .906 silver, above the legal .900 by more than the permitted tolerance. )Tj
T*(Investigation found that ingots which had been rejected and were intended for )Tj
T*(melting had instead been used for coin.[17] In the early 20th century, the San )Tj
T*(Francisco Mint struck silver coins for the Philippines, then a US possession; )Tj
T*(those pieces were included in the assay.Proof coins struck by the Mint for )Tj
T*(collectors were included in the assay; pieces struck under contract with )Tj
T*(foreign governments were not.[19] )Tj
T*( The pyx was a rosewood box, 3 feet \(0.91Â m\) square, of European work, and )Tj
T*(sealed by heavy padlocks. It was not filled by the coins put aside for the 1934 )Tj
T*(Assay Commission, of which there were 759 with a total face value of )Tj
T*($12,050.[20][21] This had increased by 1940 to 79,847 coins, all silver as gold )Tj
T*(coins were no longer being struck,[22] and by 1941, many reserved coins could )Tj
T*(not be kept in the pyx, instead being placed in packing boxes, overflowing with )Tj
T*(sealed envelopes.[19] By the late 1940s, more than ten million coins were being )Tj

T*(of silver coins required to be put aside for assay from one in 2,000 to one in )Tj
T*(10,000.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final years and abolition \(1950â€“1980\) )Tj
T*( By the 1950s, there was considerable competition among numismatists to be )Tj
T*(appointed an assay commissioner. Appointees received no compensation, but the )Tj
T*(appointment was prestigious and carried with it a prized assay medal. The )Tj
T*(procedure was changed so that the Mint Director submitted the names of more )Tj
T*(individuals than would actually be appointed to the White House, where the )Tj
T*(final choices were made. It remained possible for the director to ask for )Tj
T*(special consideration for certain individuals. Later nominations were also )Tj
T*(screened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by the IRS. The Mint )Tj
T*(Director received nominations for assay commissioner from legislators, )Tj
T*(political organizations, government officials, and from members of the public. )Tj
T*( In 1971, for the first time, the Assay Commission had no silver coins to test; )Tj
T*(none were struck by the Mint for circulation in 1970.[16] Although part-silver )Tj
T*(Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and )Tj
T*(were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and )Tj
T*(11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad,[20] though as the Associated )Tj
T*(Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, "a discovery of a bum )Tj
T*(coin hasn't occurred in years."[27] Only one in every 100,000 clad or )Tj
T*(silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in )Tj
T*(every 200,000 dimes. At the 1974 meeting, one copper-nickel Eisenhower dollar )Tj
T*(was discovered which weighed 15 grains below specification; after reference to )Tj
T*(the rules, the coin was deemed barely within guidelines. Numismatist Charles )Tj
T*(Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, )Tj
T*(stated that this incident pointed out "the basic problem with the annual trial. )Tj
T*(First, the members were not exactly sure how their job was done, or what the )Tj
T*(requirements were. Second, they really did not want to report a fault in the )Tj
T*(coinage. Finally, even if the one dollar coin had been found faulty, [it would )Tj
T*(have had] little consequence, except to prompt greater vigilance at the )Tj
T*(Mint."[29] )Tj
T*( In early 1977, outgoing Mint Director Mary Brooks sent a list of 117 nominees )Tj
T*(to the new president, Jimmy Carter, from which it was expected that about two )Tj
T*(or three dozen names would be selected. Carter refused to make any public )Tj
T*(appointments, feeling the Assay Commission was unneeded given that the Mint )Tj
T*(performed the same work through routine internal checks and that the $2,500 )Tj
T*(appropriated each year was a poor use of taxpayer money. Only government )Tj
T*(members served on the Assay Commission in 1977â€“1980.[29] Even so, hundreds of )Tj
T*(numismatists applied to be on the 1978 commission. Carter made no appointments )Tj
T*(that year; the only members were those designated by statute.[31] )Tj
T*( The 1979 meeting, attended by the government-employed commission members and )Tj
T*(Mint Director Stella Hackel Sims, was held eight days late on February 22 due )Tj
T*(to schedule conflicts.[29] In June 1979, Carter's Presidential Reorganization )Tj
T*(Project recommended the abolition of the Assay Commission and two other small )Tj
T*(agencies. The report estimated that having an Assay Commission cost the federal )Tj
T*(government about $20,000 and that the work was done better by vending machine )Tj
T*(manufacturers to avoid having their machines jam.[32] In August, columnist Jack )Tj
T*(Anderson deemed the commission an example of wasteful spending in Washington, )Tj
T*(characterizing its activities, "more than a decade ago, the government stopped )Tj
T*(putting either gold or silver in its coinsâ€”but the commission continues to hold )Tj
T*(its annual luncheon meeting. Solemnly, the commissioners measure the amounts of )Tj
T*(nonprecious metals in U.S. coins, and strike a medal to commemorate their )Tj
T*(activities. This useless exercise costs the taxpayers about $20,000 a )Tj
T*(year."[33] As coin collector and columnist Gary Palmer put it in 1979, "who )Tj
T*(really cares if the weight of a cupro-nickel quarter is off by a grain or )Tj
T*(two?"[34] )Tj
T*( On March 14, 1980, Carter approved legislation abolishing the Assay )Tj
T*(Commission, as well as the other two agencies, as recommended by his )Tj

T*(the end of gold and silver coinage, the need for the commission had )Tj
T*(diminished.[35] Numismatic leaders objected to the ending of the commission, )Tj
T*(considering the expense small and the tradition worth keeping, although they )Tj
T*(concurred the commission "had become an anachronism".[36] At the time of its )Tj
T*(abolition, the Assay Commission was the oldest existing government commission. )Tj
T*(In 2000 and 2001, New Jersey Congressman Steven Rothman introduced legislation )Tj
T*(to revive the Assay Commission, stating that re-establishing the commission )Tj
T*(would assure public confidence in the gold, silver, and platinum bullion coins )Tj
T*(struck by the Mint. The bills died in committee.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Functions and activities )Tj
T*( The general function of the Assay Commission was to examine the gold and )Tj
T*(silver coins of the Mint and ensure that they met the proper specifications. )Tj
T*(Assay commissioners were placed on one of three committees in most years: the )Tj
T*(Counting, Weighing, and Assaying Committees. The Counting Committee verified )Tj
T*(that the number of each type of coin in packets selected from the pyx matched )Tj
T*(what Mint records said should be there. The Weighing Committee measured the )Tj
T*(weight of coins from the pyx, checking them against the weight required by law. )Tj
T*(The Assaying Committee worked with the Philadelphia Mint's assayer as he )Tj
T*(measured the precious metal content of some of the coins.[39] By statute, the )Tj
T*(commission was required to ensure that the weights used at the Mint conformed )Tj
T*(to the government's official standard pound weight which had been brought from )Tj
T*(the United Kingdom.[16] In some years there was a Committee on Resolutionsâ€”in )Tj
T*(1912, it urged that a leaflet be published for visitors to the Mint's coin )Tj
T*(collection, and that a medal be struck to commemorate the collection. The full )Tj
T*(Assay Commission adopted that committee's report. )Tj
T*( According to a description of the 1948 meeting, silver coins selected for )Tj
T*(assay were first placed between steel rollers until the thickness was reduced )Tj
T*(to .0001 inches \(0.0025Â mm\), and then were chopped into fine pieces and )Tj
T*(dissolved in nitric acid. The fineness of the silver in the coin could be )Tj
T*(determined by the amount of salt solution needed to precipitate all the silver )Tj
T*(in the liquid.[23] Numismatist Francis Pessolano-Filos described the work of )Tj
T*(the Assay Commission: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Using balances and weights, the commission weighed several examples of each )Tj
T*(type of coin, then used calipers to examine them for proper thickness, and )Tj
T*(finally, using various acids and solvents, determined the amount of alloy used )Tj
T*(in manufacture of the planchets. Ledgers and journal books on the mint were )Tj
T*(also examined. If there were any imperfections or deviations from the legal )Tj
T*(standards in the coins examined, the information was immediately sent to the )Tj
T*(president of the United States.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The commission operated under rules first adopted by the 1856 commission, and )Tj
T*(then passed down, year to year, and amendable by any Assay Commission, although )Tj
T*(in practice little change was made. Under the rules, the Director of the Mint )Tj
T*(called the assay commissioners to order, then introduced the federal judge who )Tj
T*(was an ex officio member, who presided over the meetings; if the judge was )Tj
T*(absent, the members elected a chairman. The chairman divided the members into )Tj
T*(the committees. If there had been a change of officers at a mint, commissioners )Tj
T*(examined coins from before and after. After the committees completed their )Tj
T*(work, the members re-assembled to report their findings and to vote on their )Tj
T*(report. )Tj
T*( Every Assay Commission passed the coinage that it was called upon to )Tj
T*(examine.[4] If pieces varying from the standard were found, that was also )Tj
T*(noted; the 1885 Assay Commission reported the one substandard silver coin, )Tj
T*(which came from the Carson City Mint, but urged the president to take no )Tj
T*(action, noting that the coin was underweight by an amount too small to be )Tj
T*(measured by the scales at Carson City.[16] )Tj
T*( Remains of coins used in the assay were melted by the Mint; those put aside )Tj
T*(for the Assay Commission that were not used were placed in circulation from )Tj
T*(Philadelphia, and were not marked or distinguished in any way. There were )Tj

T*( [edit] Commissioners )Tj
T*( Appointments of members of the public to the Assay Commission by the president )Tj
T*(are known to have been made as early as 1841; the final ones were made in 1976. )Tj
T*(Many early commissioners were chosen for their scientific or intellectual )Tj
T*(attainments. Such qualifications were not required of later public appointees, )Tj
T*(who included such prominent figures as Ellin Berlin, wife of songwriter Irving )Tj
T*(Berlin. The first women to be appointed to the Assay Commission were Mrs. )Tj
T*(Kellogg Fairbanks of Chicago and Mrs. B.B. Munford of Richmond, Virginia, both )Tj
T*(in 1920.[45] )Tj
T*( The recordholder for service as a commissioner is Herbert Gray Torrey, 36Â )Tj
T*(times an assay commissioner between 1874 and 1910 \(missing only 1879\) by virtue )Tj
T*(of his office as assayer of the New York Assay Office. The recordholder as a )Tj
T*(presidential appointee is Dr. James Lewis Howe, head of the Department of )Tj
T*(Chemistry at Washington and Lee University, 18Â times an assay commissioner, )Tj
T*(serving in 1907 and then each year from 1910 to 1926. An employee of the )Tj
T*(National Bureau of Standards was included in the presidential appointments each )Tj
T*(year; he brought with him the weights used in the assay, which were checked by )Tj
T*(the agency in advance. Although no future president served as an assay )Tj
T*(commissioner,[a]Comptroller of the Currency Charles G. Dawes was a commissioner )Tj
T*(in 1899 and 1900; he was Vice President of the United States from 1925 to )Tj
T*(1929.[47] )Tj
T*( Among those appointed was coin collector and Congressman William A. Ashbrook, )Tj
T*(14 times an assay commissioner between 1908 and 1934. Ashbrook's presence on )Tj
T*(the 1934 Assay Commission has led to speculation that he might have used his )Tj
T*(position as an assay commissioner \(he left Congress in 1921\) to secure one or )Tj
T*(more 1933 Saint-Gaudens double eagles, almost all of which were melted due to )Tj
T*(the end of gold coinage for circulation. Assay commissioners were traditionally )Tj
T*(allowed to purchase coins from the pyx that were not assayed, and numismatic )Tj
T*(historian Roger Burdette speculates that Ashbrook, generally well-treated by )Tj
T*(the Treasury Department due to his onetime congressional position, might have )Tj
T*(exchanged other gold pieces for the 1933 coins.[48] )Tj
T*( The three known specimens of the 1873-CC quarter, without arrows by the date, )Tj
T*(and the only known dime of that description, may have been salvaged from assay )Tj
T*(pieces, as the remainder of those coins had been ordered melted as )Tj
T*(underweight.[12] A similar mystery attends the 1894 Barber dime struck at San )Tj
T*(Francisco \(1894-S\) of which the published mintage is 24, although it is not )Tj
T*(certain whether this total includes the one sent to Philadelphia to await the )Tj
T*(1895 Assay Commission. The fact that one of the 1895 assay commissioners was )Tj
T*(Robert Barnett, chief clerk of the San Francisco Mint, has led numismatic )Tj
T*(writers Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly to speculate that he may have been made )Tj
T*(an assay commissioner in order to retrieve the dime. The 1895 Assay Commission )Tj
T*(report confirms that the dime was there, as it was counted by the Counting )Tj
T*(Committee. The dime is not mentioned as having been either weighed or assayed; )Tj
T*(Oliver and Kelly, in a May 2011 article in The Numismatist, suggest that )Tj
T*(Barnett used that privilege of assay commissioners to obtain the rarity. He is )Tj
T*(not known, however, to have written or spoken of the matter before his murder )Tj
T*(in 1904.[49] )Tj
T*( In 1964, former assay commissioners formed the Old Time Assay Commissioners )Tj
T*(Society \(OTACS\). When President Carter stopped appointing public members to the )Tj
T*(commission in 1977, the OTACS fundraised in an unsuccessful attempt to induce )Tj
T*(the government to continue that tradition. The society met annually through )Tj
T*(2012, usually at the site of the yearly convention of the American Numismatic )Tj
T*(Association \(ANA\).[50] With the number of surviving OTACS members at less than )Tj

T*( [edit] Medals )Tj
T*( Assay Commission medals were struck from a variety of metals, including )Tj
T*(copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals were )Tj
T*(struck in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The )Tj
T*(initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide )Tj
T*(keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's )Tj
T*(medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden left office )Tj
T*(in 1861. )Tj
T*( Numismatists R.W. Julian and Ernest E. Keusch, in their work on Assay )Tj
T*(Commission medals, theorize that the resumption of Assay Commission medal )Tj
T*(striking in 1867 was at the request of Mint Engraver James B. Longacre to new )Tj
T*(Mint Director William Millward. Medals to be given to assay commissioners were )Tj
T*(struck each year after that until public members ceased to be appointed to the )Tj
T*(Assay Commission in 1977. )Tj
T*( Early assay medals featured on the obverse a bust of Liberty or figure of )Tj
T*(Columbia, and on the reverse a wreath surrounding the words "annual assay" and )Tj
T*(the year. The 1870 obverse, by Longacre's successor William Barber, features )Tj
T*(Moneta surrounded by implements of the assay, such as scales and the pyx. The )Tj
T*(distinctive designs for each year would sometimes be topicalâ€”the 1876 medal )Tj
T*(bears a design for the centennial of American Independence, and 1879's depicted )Tj
T*(the recently-deceased Mint Director Henry Linderman. Beginning in 1880, they )Tj
T*(most often featured the president or Treasury Secretary. The medals in 1901 and )Tj
T*(from 1903 to 1909 were rectangular, a style popular at the time. The 1920 )Tj
T*(reverse, by Engraver George T. Morgan, had a design which symbolized the ending )Tj
T*(of World War I; in 1921, an extra medal was struck in gold, given by the assay )Tj
T*(commissioners to outgoing President Woodrow Wilson as a mark of respect. )Tj
T*( The 1936 issuance was a mule of the Mint's medals for the president at the )Tj
T*(time, Franklin Roosevelt, and the first president, George Washington. Bearing )Tj
T*(the words, "annual assay 1936" on the edge, the medal was prepared in this )Tj
T*(manner by order of Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross after Mint officials )Tj
T*(realized that they had forgotten to prepare a special design for an assay )Tj
T*(medal. The 1950 medal illustrates a meeting of three 1792 officeholders )Tj
T*(\(Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and )Tj
T*(Chief Justice John Jay\). Although they were officeholders designated by the )Tj
T*(Mint Act of 1792, no assay took place until 1797, by which time all three had )Tj
T*(left those offices. There was no specially-designed medal in 1954; instead, the )Tj
T*(assay commissioners, who met in Philadelphia on Lincoln's Birthday, February )Tj
T*(12, 1954, chose to receive the Mint's standard presidential medal depicting )Tj
T*(Abraham Lincoln, with the commissioner's name on the edge. The final medals, )Tj
T*(1976 and 1977, were oval and of pewter. The 1977 medal, depicting Martha )Tj
T*(Washington, was not needed for presentation, as no public assay commissioners )Tj
T*(were appointed. They were presented to various Mint and other Treasury )Tj
T*(officials, and when there was public objection, more were struck and were )Tj
T*(placed on sale for $20 at the mints and other Treasury outlets in 1978. )Tj
T*(Material was available for about 1,500 medals, and they were initially not )Tj
T*(available by mail.[64] They were still available in person, and by mail order, )Tj
T*(in 1980.[36] )Tj
T*( All Assay Commission medals are extremely rare. Except for the 1977 medal, )Tj
T*(none is believed to have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in )Tj
T*(most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century )Tj
T*(issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices )Tj
T*(in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury )Tj
T*(Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's )Tj
T*(series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were )Tj
T*(struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from )Tj
T*(the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown )Tj
T*(number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck )Tj
T*(than the originals. )Tj

T*(decaying wood such as fallen twigs and sticks, moss-covered logs, and stumps. )Tj
T*( Unlike other mushrooms known to release spores in response to a circadian )Tj
T*(rhythm, spore release in M.Â rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried )Tj
T*(mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to )Tj
T*(three weeksâ€”a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other )Tj

T*(might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences )Tj
T*(in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field )Tj
T*(characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.Â rotula mushrooms are not )Tj
T*(generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is )Tj
T*(attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The species was first described by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli )Tj
T*(as Agaricus rotula in 1772.[4] In 1821 Elias Magnus Fries redescribed the )Tj
T*(mushroom in Systema Mycologicum,[5] and later transferred it to Marasmius in )Tj
T*(his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici.[6]Synonyms include names derived from )Tj
T*(generic transfers to Androsaceus by Narcisse ThÃ©ophile Patouillard in 1887,[7] )Tj
T*(and to Chamaeceras by Otto Kuntze in 1898;[2] both of these genera are now )Tj
T*(obsolete and have since been sunk back into Marasmius.[8] )Tj
T*( In his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants, Samuel Frederick Gray )Tj
T*(introduced the generic name Micromphale, including the species Micromphale )Tj
T*(collariatum,[1] which was based on William Withering's 1796 Merulius )Tj
T*(collariatus.[9] In 1946 Alexander H. Smith and Rolf Singer proposed to conserve )Tj
T*(the name Marasmius over Micromphale; the latter had nomenclatorial priority as )Tj
T*(it was published first.[10] The generic name Marasmius, with M.Â rotula as the )Tj
T*(lectotype species, was later conserved at the 1954 Paris Congress on Botanical )Tj
T*(Nomenclature.[11][12]M.Â rotula is also the type species of section Marasmius )Tj
T*(within the genus. This grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh, )Tj
T*(a cap cuticle with broom cells \(finger-like projections common to Marasmius )Tj
T*(species\) ornamented with numerous warts, gills usually attached to a collar )Tj
T*(surrounding the stem, and the presence of black rhizomorphs on the stem.[13] )Tj
T*( Several varieties of M.Â rotula have been described. Miles Berkeley and Moses )Tj
T*(Ashley Curtis named var. fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap.[14] In 1887 Pier )Tj
T*(Andrea Saccardo described var. microcephalus from Italy, with caps half the )Tj
T*(normal size.[15] It is now understood, however, that fruit body morphology is )Tj
T*(variable and dependent upon environmental conditions. Joseph SchrÃ¶ter described )Tj
T*(var. phyllophyla in 1889,[16] but that taxon is now treated as Marasmius )Tj
T*(bulliardii.[17] )Tj
T*( Marasmius rotula is commonly known as the "pinwheel mushroom", the "pinwheel )Tj
T*(Marasmius",[18] the "collared parachute",[19] or the "horse hair fungus".[20] )Tj
T*(This latter name is shared with other Marasmius species, including M.Â )Tj
T*(androsaceus[21] and M.Â crinis-equi.[22] Gray called it the "collared )Tj
T*(dimple-stool".[1] The name "little wheel fungus" is suggestive of the collar to )Tj
T*(which the gills are attached like the spokes of a wheel,[23] like the specific )Tj
T*(epithet, which is a diminutive of rota, the Latin word for "wheel".[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The cap of the fruit body is thin and membranous, measuring 3 to 20 mm \(0.1 to )Tj
T*(0.8 in\) in diameter.[24] It has a convex shape slightly depressed in the )Tj
T*(center, conspicuous furrows in an outline of the gills, and scalloped edges. )Tj
T*(Young, unexpanded caps are yellowish brown; as the cap expands, the color )Tj
T*(lightens to whitish or light pinkish-white,[25] often with a darker, sometimes )Tj
T*(brown center.[26] The variety fusca has brown caps.[14] The white or slightly )Tj
T*(yellowish flesh is very thin, reaching about 0.25â€“1.5Â mm thick in the central )Tj
T*(part of the cap, and even thinner at the margin.[27] )Tj
T*( Gills are attached to a collar, never to the stem, although some specimens )Tj
T*(have the collar pressed close enough to it that this characteristic may be less )Tj

T*(forests of Trinidad, can only be reliably distinguished from M.Â rotula by )Tj

T*(corticola is smaller than Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is )Tj

T*( [edit] Ecology and distribution )Tj
T*( Marasmius rotula is a saprobic species[30] and as such obtains nutrients by )Tj
T*(decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in )Tj
T*(groups or clusters on dead wood \(especially beech\), woody debris such as twigs )Tj
T*(or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are )Tj
T*(easily overlooked because of their diminutive size,[23] are often present in )Tj
T*(abundance after rains.[36] The species is relatively intolerant of low water )Tj
T*(potentials, and will grow poorly or not at all under water stress )Tj
T*(conditions.[37][38] It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more )Tj
T*(fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in )Tj
T*(the deeper layers of the soil.[37] The Magnolia Warbler has been noted to line )Tj
T*(its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.[39] )Tj
T*( In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam investigated the periodicity of )Tj
T*(spore release in M.Â rotula and concluded that spore discharge did not follow a )Tj
T*(regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms,[40] but )Tj
T*(rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a )Tj
T*(spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates )Tj
T*(with the amount of rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam )Tj
T*(noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed )Tj
T*(in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge )Tj
T*(to occur.[41] )Tj
T*( Like those of many other species of Marasmius, the fruit bodies of M.Â rotula )Tj
T*(can desiccate and shrivel in dry periods, then revive when sufficient moisture )Tj
T*(is available again in the form of rain or high humidity. Gilliam's study )Tj
T*(demonstrated that revived fruit bodies were capable of discharging spores over )Tj
T*(a period of at least three weeks, whereas previous studies using similar )Tj
T*(methods with other Agaricomycetes showed spore discharge occurred over a )Tj
T*(shorter period of up to six days after revival. The potential for sustained )Tj
T*(spore production and discharge may be due to the growth of new basidioles )Tj
T*(\(immature basidia\) during periods of growth, which then complete maturation )Tj
T*(when the mushroom revives. This may also explain why the gills become thicker )Tj
T*(as the mushroom matures.[41] )Tj

T*(to the dimensionless eccentricity vector of celestial mechanics.[8] Various )Tj
T*(generalizations of the LRL vector have been defined, which incorporate the )Tj
T*(effects of special relativity, electromagnetic fields and even different types )Tj
T*(of central forces. )Tj
T*( [edit] Context )Tj
T*( A single particle moving under any conservative central force has at least )Tj
T*(four constants of motion, the total energy E and the three Cartesian components )Tj
T*(of the angular momentum vector L. The particle's orbit is confined to a plane )Tj
T*(defined by the particle's initial momentum p \(or, equivalently, its velocity v\) )Tj
T*(and the vector r between the particle and the center of force \(see Figure 1, )Tj
T*(below\). )Tj
T*( As defined below \(see Mathematical definition\), the Laplaceâ€“Rungeâ€“Lenz vector )Tj
T*(\(LRL vector\) A always lies in the plane of motion for any central force. )Tj
T*(However, A is constant only for an inverse-square central force.[1] For most )Tj
T*(central forces, however, this vector A is not constant, but changes in both )Tj
T*(length and direction; if the central force is approximately an inverse-square )Tj
T*(law, the vector A is approximately constant in length, but slowly rotates its )Tj
T*(direction. A generalized conserved LRL vector can be defined for all central )Tj
T*(forces, but this generalized vector is a complicated function of position, and )Tj
T*(usually not expressible in closed form.[9][10] )Tj
T*( The plane of motion is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector L, which )Tj
T*(is constant; this may be expressed mathematically by the vector dot product )Tj
T*(equation rÂ·L = 0; likewise, since A lies in that plane, AÂ·L = 0. )Tj
T*( The LRL vector differs from other conserved quantities in the following )Tj
T*(property. Whereas for typical conserved quantities, there is a corresponding )Tj
T*(cyclic coordinate in the three-dimensional Lagrangian of the system, there does )Tj
T*(not exist such a coordinate for the LRL vector. Thus, the conservation of the )Tj
T*(LRL vector must be derived directly, e.g., by the method of Poisson brackets, )Tj
T*(as described below. Conserved quantities of this kind are called "dynamic", in )Tj
T*(contrast to the usual "geometric" conservation laws, e.g., that of the angular )Tj
T*(momentum. )Tj
T*( [edit] History of rediscovery )Tj
T*( The LRL vector A is a constant of motion of the important Kepler problem, and )Tj
T*(is useful in describing astronomical orbits, such as the motion of the planets. )Tj
T*(Nevertheless, it has never been well known among physicists, possibly because )Tj
T*(it is less intuitive than momentum and angular momentum. Consequently, it has )Tj
T*(been rediscovered independently several times over the last three centuries.[7] )Tj
T*( Jakob Hermann was the first to show that A is conserved for a special case of )Tj
T*(the inverse-square central force,[11] and worked out its connection to the )Tj
T*(eccentricity of the orbital ellipse. Hermann's work was generalized to its )Tj
T*(modern form by Johann Bernoulli in 1710.[12] At the end of the century, )Tj
T*(Pierre-Simon de Laplace rediscovered the conservation of A, deriving it )Tj
T*(analytically, rather than geometrically.[13] In the middle of the nineteenth )Tj
T*(century, William Rowan Hamilton derived the equivalent eccentricity vector )Tj
T*(defined below,[8] using it to show that the momentum vector p moves on a circle )Tj
T*(for motion under an inverse-square central force \(Figure 3\).[6] )Tj
T*( At the beginning of the twentieth century, Josiah Willard Gibbs derived the )Tj
T*(same vector by vector analysis.[14] Gibbs' derivation was used as an example by )Tj
T*(Carle Runge in a popular German textbook on vectors,[15] which was referenced )Tj
T*(by Wilhelm Lenz in his paper on the \(old\) quantum mechanical treatment of the )Tj
T*(hydrogen atom.[16] In 1926, the vector was used by Wolfgang Pauli to derive the )Tj
T*(spectrum of hydrogen using modern quantum mechanics, but not the SchrÃ¶dinger )Tj
T*(equation;[3] after Pauli's publication, it became known mainly as the )Tj
T*(Rungeâ€“Lenz vector. )Tj

T*( The Greater Crested Tern[2] \(Thalasseus bergii\), also called Crested Tern or )Tj

T*(coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical Old World. Its five )Tj
T*(subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the )Tj
T*(central Pacific and Australia, all populations dispersing widely from the )Tj
T*(breeding range after nesting. This large tern is closely related to the Royal )Tj
T*(and Lesser Crested Terns, but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour. )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern has grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow bill, )Tj
T*(and a shaggy black crest which recedes in winter. Its young have a distinctive )Tj
T*(appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, and rely on )Tj

T*( This is an adaptable species which has learned to follow fishing boats for )Tj
T*(jettisoned bycatch, and to utilise unusual nest sites such as the roofs of )Tj
T*(buildings and artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works. Its eggs and )Tj
T*(young are taken by gulls and ibises, and human activities such as fishing, )Tj
T*(shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines. There are no )Tj

T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely )Tj
T*(related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but )Tj
T*(typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings \(which give them a fast, )Tj
T*(buoyant flight\), a deeply forked tail and short legs. Most species are grey )Tj

T*(white in the winter.[3] )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern was originally described as Sterna bergii by German )Tj
T*(naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, but was moved to its current genus, )Tj
T*(Thalasseus,[5] after mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that the three main )Tj

T*(Africa from Namibia to Tanzania, and possibly on islands around Madagascar. )Tj
T*(There is then a break in the breeding distribution of this species until )Tj
T*(Somalia and the Red Sea, and another discontinuity further east in southern )Tj
T*(India.[9] )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including )Tj
T*(Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles, the Chagos Archipelago, and )Tj
T*(Rodrigues.[16] There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands, including )Tj
T*(Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, the Society Islands and the Tuamotus.[17] )Tj
T*( The nests are located on lowâ€‘lying sandy, rocky, or coral islands, sometimes )Tj
T*(amongst stunted shrubs, often without any shelter at all.[15] When not )Tj
T*(breeding, the Greater Crested Tern will roost or rest on open shores, less )Tj
T*(often on boats, pilings, harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons. )Tj
T*(It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters.[13] )Tj
T*( All populations of Greater Crested Tern disperse after breeding. When Southern )Tj
T*(African birds leave colonies in Namibia and Western Cape Province, most adults )Tj
T*(move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa. Many young birds also )Tj
T*(travel east, sometimes more than 2,000Â km \(1,200Â mi\), but others move )Tj
T*(northwards along the western coast. T. b. thalassina winters on the east )Tj
T*(African coast north to Kenya and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban. )Tj
T*(Populations of T. b. velox breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to )Tj
T*(be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly migratory, but those breeding in )Tj
T*(the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya.[13]T. b. )Tj
T*(cristata mostly stays within 400Â km \(260Â mi\) of its colonies, but some birds )Tj

T*(reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex )Tj
T*(and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this )Tj
T*(behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between )Tj
T*(the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies )Tj
T*(around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also )Tj
T*(fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.[24] )Tj
T*( The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping )Tj
T*(ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones. )Tj
T*(One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30Â )Tj
T*(days prior to hatching.[13] The eggs are cream with blackish streaks.[25] Egg )Tj
T*(laying is synchronised within a breeding colony[26] and more tightly so within )Tj
T*(sub-colonies.[27] Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched )Tj
T*(chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two )Tj
T*(days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest.[28] The precocial )Tj
T*(chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both )Tj
T*(parents, but may gather in crÃ¨ches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 )Tj
T*(to 40Â days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until )Tj
T*(they are about four months old.[13] )Tj
T*( In South Africa, this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of )Tj
T*(building, sometimes with Hartlaub's Gull, which also shares the more typical )Tj
T*(nesting sites of the nominate race. In 2000, 7.5%Â of the population of this )Tj
T*(subspecies bred on roofs.[29] Artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works )Tj
T*(have also recently been colonised by this adaptable seabird.[9] )Tj
T*( Adult terns have few predators, but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed )Tj
T*(of their food by Kelp Gulls, and that species, along with Hartlaub's Gull, )Tj
T*(Silver Gull and Sacred Ibis, has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings, )Tj
T*(especially when colonies are disturbed.[9][30] Smaller subcolonies with a )Tj
T*(relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more )Tj
T*(predation.[27] In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths )Tj
T*(by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been )Tj
T*(documented.[8] )Tj
T*( Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the )Tj
T*(Greater Crested Tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler )Tj
T*(discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern )Tj
T*(Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large )Tj
T*(prawn trawl fishery.[31] Conversely, purse-seine fishing reduces the available )Tj
T*(food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of Great Crested Terns )Tj
T*(breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to )Tj
T*(changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by )Tj
T*(purse-seine fishing.[30] Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with )Tj
T*(trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by longline )Tj
T*(fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that )Tj
T*(overall numbers are significantly affected.[13] )Tj
T*( An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island, )Tj
T*(South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, kelp )Tj
T*(mucilage and phytoplankton. After treatment, 90%Â of the birds were fit to be )Tj
T*(released.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Feeding )Tj
T*( Fish are the main food of the Greater Crested Tern, found to make up nearly )Tj
T*(90% of all prey items with the remainder including cephalopods, crustaceans and )Tj
T*(insects.[13] Unusual vertebrate prey included agamid lizards and green turtle )Tj
T*(hatchlings.[31] )Tj
T*( The Great Crested Tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The expansion of rugby in the first half of the 19th century was driven by )Tj
T*(ex-pupils from many of England's Public Schools, especially Rugby, who, upon )Tj
T*(finishing school, took the game with them to universities, to London, and to )Tj
T*(the counties.[4] England's first international match was against Scotland on )Tj
T*(Monday 27 March 1871.[5] Not only was this match England's first, but it also )Tj
T*(proved to be the first ever rugby union international.[5] Scotland won the )Tj
T*(match by a goal and a try to a try,[6][7] in front of a crowd of 4,000 people )Tj
T*(at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh.[8] A subsequent international took place at the )Tj
T*(Oval in London on 5 February 1872 which saw England defeat Scotland by a goal, )Tj
T*(a drop goal and two tries to one drop goal.[7][9][10] In those early days there )Tj
T*(was no points system, it was only after 1890 that a format allowing the )Tj
T*(introduction of a points system was provided.[7] Up until 1875 international )Tj
T*(rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored \(conversions and )Tj
T*(dropped goals\), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to )Tj
T*(decide a match if teams were level on goals.[11] )Tj
T*( In 1875, England played their first game against the Irish at the Oval, )Tj
T*(winning by one goal, one drop goal and one try to nil;[7] the match was )Tj
T*(Ireland's first ever Test.[12][13] England defeated Scotland in 1880 to become )Tj
T*(the first winners of the Calcutta Cup.[14][15] Their first match against Wales )Tj
T*(was played on 19 February 1881 at Richardson's Field in Blackheath.[15][16] )Tj
T*(England recorded their largest victory, defeating the Welsh by seven goals, six )Tj
T*(tries, and one drop goal to nil[7] and scoring 13 tries in the process.[16] The )Tj
T*(subsequent meeting the following year at St Helens in Swansea was a closer )Tj
T*(contest; with England winning by two goals and four tries to nil[7][17] Two )Tj
T*(years later, the first Home Nations championship was held and England emerged )Tj
T*(as the inaugural winners.[18] In 1889, England played their first match against )Tj
T*(a non-home nations team when they defeated the New Zealand Natives by one goal )Tj
T*(and four tries to nil[7] at Rectory Field in Blackheath.[19][20] In 1890 )Tj
T*(England shared the Home Nations trophy with Scotland.[21] )Tj
T*( England first played New Zealand \(the All Blacks\) in 1905. The All Blacks )Tj
T*(scored five tries, worth three points at this time, to win 15â€“0.[22] The )Tj
T*(following year, they played France for the first time, and later that year they )Tj
T*(first faced South Africa \(known as the Springboks\); James Peters was withdrawn )Tj
T*(from the England squad after the South Africans objected to playing against a )Tj
T*(black player. The match was drawn 3â€“3.[23] England first played France in 1905, )Tj

T*( [edit] Twickenham )Tj
T*( Up until 1910, the English rugby team used various stadia in a number of )Tj
T*(venues around England before settling at Twickenham Stadium. After sell-out )Tj
T*(matches at Crystal Palace in 1905 and 1906 against New Zealand and South Africa )Tj
T*(respectively, the Rugby Football Union \(RFU\) decided to invest in their own )Tj
T*(ground. In 1906, the RFU arranged for William Williams to find a home ground )Tj
T*(for English Rugby. The land for the ground was purchased the following year for )Tj
T*(Â£5,572 12s and 6d, and construction began the following year.[60] )Tj
T*( The first England match was held on 9 October 1910 between England and Wales. )Tj
T*(England ran out winners, 11â€“6, beating Wales for the first time since 1898.[61] )Tj
T*(The stadium was expanded in 1927 and again in 1932. Further upgrades did not )Tj
T*(happen until the 1990s when new North, East and West stands were built.[60] A )Tj
T*(new South stand was built in 2005 and 2006 to make the stadium into a complete )Tj
T*(bowl. The first match to be played at the redeveloped Twickenham was on Sunday )Tj
T*(5 November 2006 against the All Blacks.[62] England lost the match 20â€“41 in )Tj
T*(front of a record crowd of 82,076.[63] )Tj
T*( Although England have played home matches almost exclusively at Twickenham )Tj
T*(since 1910, they have played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium twice in 1998, )Tj
T*(at Old Trafford against New Zealand in 1997 and at Wembley Stadium against )Tj

T*(hand gestures that played on the double entendres of some of the words. During )Tj
T*(the 1970s the Twickenham crowd also sang it during England matches then coming )Tj
T*(into the last match of the 1988 season, against the Irish, England had lost 15 )Tj
T*(of their previous 23 matches in the Five Nations Championship. The Twickenham )Tj
T*(crowd had only seen one solitary England try in the previous two years and at )Tj
T*(half time against Ireland they were 0â€“3 down. During the second half a )Tj
T*(remarkable transformation took place and England started playing an expansive )Tj

T*(at their school games sang the song on his final try, and other spectators )Tj
T*(around the ground joined in.[67][68] Since then Swing Low, Sweet Chariot became )Tj
T*(a song to sing at England home games,[69] in the same way that The Fields of )Tj
T*(Athenry is sung in Dublin and Cwm Rhondda is sung at Cardiff. It has since )Tj
T*(become the anthem of the team as in 1991 the result of a plan of the then RFU )Tj
T*(marketing director Mike Coley for the team to launch a song leading up to that )Tj
T*(year's Rugby World cup. He had wanted to use Jerusalem but it was used in the )Tj
T*(Rugby League cup final that year so the song was changed at short notice to )Tj
T*(Swing Low. there were a number of versions recorded including a 'rap' version )Tj
T*(with Jerry Guscott doing a solo. Needless to say that was never released but )Tj
T*(the version released did reach the top 40 in the UK singles chart during the )Tj
T*(competition and was then adopted as the England rugby song.[70] )Tj
T*( England have returned to the traditional all-white shirts, white shorts with )Tj
T*(navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts is a red rose, rather than the )Tj
T*(Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and )Tj
T*(cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt )Tj
T*(sponsor.[71] Red was the change strip, although prior to the introduction of )Tj
T*(the red strip, navy blue was used. Purple was used as the change strip as of )Tj
T*(the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the )Tj
T*(original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby )Tj
T*(World Cup the change kit was black. )Tj
T*( The Rugby Football Union \(RFU\) had created the national side's emblem prior to )Tj
T*(an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was )Tj
T*(chosen to be the sideâ€™s emblem.[72] The white kit worn by the national team was )Tj
T*(taken from the kit used at Rugby School.[72] Alfred Wright, an employee of the )Tj
T*(Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of )Tj
T*(the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its )Tj
T*(depiction.[72] The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor )Tj
T*(alteration until the late 1990s.[72] It was not until 1997 that the rose was )Tj
T*(modernised when Nike became the official strip supplier. )Tj
T*( In 2003 England first used a skin-tight strip. This was intended to make it )Tj
T*(more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling.[73] The )Tj
T*(home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials )Tj
T*(used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a )Tj
T*(sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the )Tj
T*(top left, and a changed away-strip \(dark blue to red\), have received criticism )Tj
T*(because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the )Tj
T*(expense of the traditional red rose.[74] The new strip was introduced in )Tj
T*(England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was )Tj
T*(first used against France on 18 August.[75] )Tj
T*( The former England home strip is white with a strip of red around the neck, )Tj
T*(and the away strip is black \(causing much controversy due to the famous )Tj
T*(All-Black kit of New Zealand\), both kits have a ground breaking new technology )Tj

T*(non-playing accomplishments in the sport.[85] )Tj
T*( Wavell Wakefield represented England in 31 Tests between 1920 and 1927, )Tj
T*(including 13 Tests as captain. He was involved in three Five Nations Grand )Tj
T*(Slams in 1921, 1923 and 1924. Playing as flanker, Wakefield introduced new )Tj
T*(elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He )Tj

T*(Grand Slam â€“ England's first since 1957. Later that year, he captained the )Tj
T*(British Lions to South Africa â€“ the first time an Englishman had captained the )Tj
T*(Lions since 1930. Furthermore, Beaumont represented the Barbarians FC on )Tj
T*(fifteen occasions.[88] )Tj
T*( The youngest ever England captain at 22, Will Carling represented England in )Tj
T*(72 Tests, and as captain 59 times between 1988 and 1996. He was best known as a )Tj

T*(five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England )Tj
T*(to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the Barbarians FC. His )Tj

T*(\(minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales\).[85] )Tj
T*( Jason Leonard, also known as "The Fun Bus",[92] appeared 114 times for England )Tj
T*(at prop, which was the world record for international appearances for a )Tj
T*(national team until 2005, when it was surpassed by Australia's scrum-half )Tj
T*(George Gregan.[93] He was on the England team that finished runners up to )Tj
T*(Australia in the 1991 Rugby World Cup final, but avenged this twelve years )Tj
T*(later, coming on as a substitute for Phil Vickery in England's victorious 2003 )Tj
T*(Rugby World Cup final appearance. He also went on three British and Irish Lions )Tj
T*(tours where he was capped five times.[93] )Tj
T*( Alan Rotherham and Harry Vassall, both 19th-century greats for Oxford and )Tj
T*(England, were inducted into the IRB Hall in April 2011. The IRB recognised them )Tj
T*(for "their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played", specifically )Tj
T*(stating that they "are credited with pioneering the passing game and the )Tj
T*(three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s."[86] )Tj
T*( Two other England internationals, John Kendall-Carpenter and Clive Woodward, )Tj
T*(were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards. )Tj
T*(Although both had notable careers for England, they were recognised for )Tj
T*(accomplishments in other roles in the sport. Kendall-Carpenter was cited as one )Tj
T*(of four key figures in the creation of the Rugby World Cup, whilst Woodward was )Tj
T*(inducted as coach of the 2003 World Cup winners, alongside all other World )Tj
T*(Cup-winning coaches from 1987 to 2007.[85] )Tj
T*( [edit] Individual records )Tj
T*( Jonny Wilkinson holds the record for most points for England: 1,151.[94] )Tj
T*(Wilkinson is also the most capped back with 91 caps. The record for tries is )Tj
T*(held by Rory Underwood with 49 tries. The most capped England player is former )Tj
T*(prop Jason Leonard who made 114 appearances over his 14-year career.[95] )Tj
T*(England's youngest ever Test player was Colin Laird who was 18 years and 134 )Tj
T*(days old when he played against Wales in 1927.[96] )Tj
T*( [edit] Training )Tj
T*( Pennyhill Park Hotel is the chosen training base for the team until the finish )Tj
T*(of the 2011â€“12 season. Loughborough University, Bisham Abbey and the University )Tj
T*(of Bath grounds served as training bases prior to this agreement. Martin )Tj
T*(Johnson noted the hotel's facilities and its proximity to Twickenham and )Tj
T*(Heathrow as deciding factors in this decision.[97] The team had their own )Tj
T*(pitchside gym and fitness rooms constructed on the hotel premises at the start )Tj
T*(of the long-term arrangement. Since its completion in 2010 the team also )Tj
T*(regularly use Surrey Sports Park at the University of Surrey in nearby )Tj
T*(Guildford for much of their training.[98] )Tj
T*( [edit] Club versus country )Tj
T*( Although the England team is governed by the Rugby Football Union \(RFU\), )Tj
T*(players have been contracted to their clubs since the advent of professionalism )Tj
T*(in late 1995. Since then, players have often been caught in a "power struggle" )Tj
T*(between their clubs and the RFU; this is commonly referred to as a club versus )Tj
T*(country conflict.[99] The first major conflict between England's top clubs \(who )Tj
T*(play in the English Premiership\) and the RFU occurred in 1998, when some of the )Tj
T*(clubs refused to release players to tour Australia, New Zealand and South )Tj
T*(Africa.[100] The tour became known as the "Tour from hell" after an England )Tj
T*(squad of second-string players were defeated in all four Tests, including a )Tj
T*(76â€“0 defeat by Australia.[101] The clubs also withdrew from the 1998/99 )Tj
T*(European Cup \(now called the Heineken Cup\).[102] )Tj
T*( In 2001, the top clubs and the RFU formed England Rugby to help govern the )Tj
T*(club and international game. The parties agreed to restrict the number of )Tj
T*(matches at club and international level that elite players \(a group of 50 or 60 )Tj
T*(players selected by the RFU\) could play in order to prevent player burnout and )Tj
T*(injuries.[103] In return for releasing players from club commitments, the clubs )Tj
T*(were to receive compensation from the RFU. This agreement was considered )Tj
T*(central to the England victory in the 2003 World Cup. Sir Clive Woodward, )Tj
T*(England coach from November 1997, resigned in 2004 because he was unable to get )Tj
T*(the access to the players that he wanted; "I wanted more from the union â€“ more )Tj
T*(training days with the players, more influence over the way they were treated â€“ )Tj

T*(and ended up with less."[104]Andy Robinson, Woodward's successor, blamed the )Tj
T*(lack of control over players for his team's unsuccessful record.[105]Brian )Tj
T*(Ashton, who took over from Robinson, intentionally named his playing squad for )Tj
T*(Six Nations matches in 2007 at an early opportunity in the hope that their )Tj
T*(clubs would not play them in the weekend prior to a Test.[106] The RFU and the )Tj
T*(Premiership clubs are negotiating a similar deal to the one in 2001 that will )Tj
T*(enable international players to be released into the England squad prior to )Tj
T*(international matches.[107] )Tj
T*( [edit] Coaches )Tj
T*( The following is a list of all England coaches. The first appointed coach was )Tj
T*(Don White in 1969. The current England Manager is Stuart Lancaster.[108] He )Tj
T*(succeeded Martin Johnson, who stepped down on 16 November 2011 after a )Tj
T*(disappointing World Cup campaign that also featured several off-field )Tj
T*(controversies.[109] Lancaster, as England Manager, is responsible for the )Tj
T*(coaching appointments. The coaching team currently includes offensive coaches, )Tj
T*(defensive coaches, kicking coaches, scrumming, tackling etc.[110][111] )Tj

T*( Katharine Houghton Hepburn \(May 12, 1907 â€“ June 29, 2003\) was an American )Tj
T*(actress of film, stage, and television. Known for her headstrong independence )Tj
T*(and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned )Tj
T*(more than 60 years. Her work came in a range of genres, from screwball comedy )Tj
T*(to literary drama, and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actressâ€”a )Tj
T*(record for any performer. Hepburn's characters were often strong, sophisticated )Tj
T*(women with a hidden vulnerability. )Tj
T*( Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act )Tj
T*(while studying at Bryn Mawr College. After four years in the theatre, favorable )Tj
T*(reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her )Tj
T*(early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy )Tj
T*(Award for her third picture, Morning Glory \(1933\), but this was followed by a )Tj
T*(series of commercial failures. In 1938 she was labeled "box office poison". )Tj
T*(Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio )Tj
T*(Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story, which she )Tj
T*(sold on the condition that she be the star. In the 1940s she was contracted to )Tj
T*(Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer )Tj
T*(Tracy. The screen-partnership spanned 25 years, and produced nine movies. )Tj
T*( Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly )Tj
T*(appeared in Shakespeare stage productions and tackled a range of literary )Tj
T*(roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African )Tj
T*(Queen \(1951\), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her )Tj
T*(work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner \(1967\), The Lion in Winter \(1968\), and On )Tj
T*(Golden Pond \(1981\). In the 1970s she began appearing in television movies, )Tj
T*(which became the focus of her career in later life. She remained active into )Tj
T*(old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a )Tj
T*(period of inactivity and ill-health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96. )Tj
T*( Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to )Tj
T*(conform to societal expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, )Tj
T*(athletic, and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so. She )Tj
T*(married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. A 26-year )Tj
T*(affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public. With her )Tj
T*(unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the )Tj
T*(screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the "modern woman" in 20th-century America )Tj
T*(and helped change perceptions of women. In 1999, she was named by the American )Tj
T*(Film Institute as the top female Hollywood legend.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Hepburn was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on May 12, 1907, the second of six )Tj
T*(children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn \(1879â€“1962\), a urologist at )Tj
T*(Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton \(1878â€“1951\), a feminist )Tj
T*(campaigner. Both fought for social change in America: Thomas Hepburn helped )Tj

T*( The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her )Tj
T*(hair short like a boy's.[12] Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use )Tj
T*(their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, )Tj
T*(wrestle, and play golf and tennis.[13] Golf became a passion for his oldest )Tj
T*(daughter: she took daily lessons and became very good, reaching the semi-final )Tj
T*(of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship.[14] She loved swimming in )Tj
T*(Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that )Tj
T*("the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you."[15] Hepburn was a fan )Tj
T*(of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night.[16] With )Tj
T*(her friends and siblings, she would put on plays and perform to her neighbors )Tj
T*(for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.[17] )Tj
T*( On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn )Tj
T*(discovered the body of her older brother Tom, whom she adored,[18] dead from an )Tj
T*(apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself.[19] The )Tj
T*(Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have )Tj
T*(been an experiment that had gone wrong.[20] The incident made the teenage )Tj
T*(Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people.[21] She shied away from other )Tj

T*( In 1924, Hepburn gained a place at Bryn Mawr College. She attended the )Tj
T*(institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and )Tj
T*(recalled disliking the experience.[24] It was the first time she had been in )Tj
T*(school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her )Tj
T*(classmates.[25] She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and )Tj
T*(was once suspended for smoking in her room.[26] Hepburn was drawn to acting but )Tj

T*(schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the )Tj
T*(Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight )Tj
T*(nights.[32] Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip )Tj
T*(Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she quit to )Tj
T*(marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, her beau from college. She planned to leave the )Tj
T*(theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy )Tj
T*(role in Holiday, which she held for six months.[34] )Tj
T*( In 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in )Tj
T*(Death Takes a Holiday. She felt the role was perfect,[35] but again she was )Tj
T*(fired.[36] Hepburn went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for )Tj
T*(minimum pay in A Month in the Country. In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined a )Tj
T*(stock company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She left halfway through the )Tj
T*(summer season, and continued studying with a drama tutor.[37] In early 1931, )Tj
T*(she was cast in the Broadway production of Art and Mrs. Bottle. She was )Tj
T*(released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying "She )Tj
T*(looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent", but then )Tj
T*(rehired when no other actress could be found.[38] It went on to be a small )Tj
T*(success.[39] )Tj
T*( Hepburn appeared in a number of plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, )Tj
T*(Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit.[38] During the summer of 1931, Philip )Tj
T*(Barry asked her to appear in his new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie )Tj
T*(Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure this was the )Tj
T*(role to make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was )Tj
T*(fired.[40] When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, "Well, )Tj
T*(to be brutally frank, you weren't very good."[40] This unsettled the )Tj
T*(self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work.[41] She took a small )Tj
T*(role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she received an offer to read )Tj
T*(for the lead role in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.[42] )Tj
T*( The Warrior's Husband proved to be Hepburn's break-out performance. Biographer )Tj
T*(Charles Higham states that the play was ideal for the actress, requiring an )Tj
T*(aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself )Tj
T*(with its production.[43] It opened on March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on )Tj
T*(Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow )Tj
T*(stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show )Tj
T*(ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews.[44] Richard )Tj

T*( A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn's appearance in )Tj

T*(was impressed by what he saw: "There was this odd creature," he recalled, "she )Tj

T*(she picked up a glass: "I thought she was very talented in that action."[47] )Tj
T*(Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown )Tj

T*(Divorcement, RKO signed the actress to a long-term contract.[56] George Cukor )Tj
T*(became a lifetime friend and colleagueâ€”he and Hepburn made ten films )Tj
T*(together.[57] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's second film was Christopher Strong \(1933\), the story of an aviatrix )Tj
T*(and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, )Tj
T*(but Hepburn's own reviews were good.[58] Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal )Tj
T*(American that although her mannerisms were grating, "they compel attention, and )Tj
T*(they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive )Tj
T*(personality."[59] Her third picture confirmed Hepburn as a major actress in )Tj
T*(Hollywood.[60] For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace in Morning Glory, she )Tj
T*(won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of )Tj
T*(producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, )Tj
T*(insisted that the role be hers.[61] Hepburn chose not to attend the awards )Tj
T*(ceremonyâ€”as she would not for the duration of her careerâ€”but was thrilled with )Tj
T*(the win.[62] Her success continued with the role of Jo in the screen adaptation )Tj
T*(of Little Women \(1933\). The movie was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest )Tj
T*(successes to date,[50] and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice )Tj
T*(Film Festival. Little Women was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was )Tj
T*(proud of her performance, later saying, "I defy anyone to be as good as I was )Tj
T*([as Jo]".[60] )Tj
T*( By the end of 1933 Hepburn was at the top of her profession, but yearned to )Tj
T*(prove herself on Broadway.[63]Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre )Tj
T*(producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump.[64] He asked Hepburn )Tj
T*(to appear in the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary.[65] )Tj
T*(Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film Spitfire \(1934\). Hepburn's )Tj
T*(role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. It is widely )Tj
T*(considered one of her worst films, and Hepburn received poor reviews for the )Tj
T*(effort.[66] Hepburn kept a picture of Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life )Tj
T*(to "[keep] me humble."[67] )Tj
T*( The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance )Tj
T*(sale.[65] Harris's poor direction had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she )Tj
T*(struggled with the performance.[68] Despite this, Harris moved the play to New )Tj
T*(York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on )Tj
T*(December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics.[69]Dorothy )Tj
T*(Parker quipped, "Katharine Hepburn runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."[28] )Tj
T*(Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of )Tj
T*(rapidly declining box office sales.[70] Harris decided to take the show to )Tj
T*(Chicago, saying to Hepburn, "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the )Tj
T*(money I can make out of you." Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close )Tj
T*(the production instead.[71] She later referred to Harris as "hands-down the )Tj
T*(most diabolical person I have ever met",[64] and claimed this experience was )Tj
T*(important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.[72] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career struggles, "box office poison" \(1934â€“1938\) )Tj
T*( After the failure of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little )Tj
T*(Minister \(1934\), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to )Tj
T*(repeat the success of Little Women.[73] There was no such recurrence, and the )Tj
T*(picture was a commercial failure.[74] The romantic drama Break of Hearts \(1935\) )Tj
T*(with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money at the box )Tj
T*(office.[75] After three forgettable movies, success returned to Hepburn with )Tj
T*(Alice Adams \(1935\), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social )Tj
T*(ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role.[76] )Tj
T*(The picture was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the )Tj

T*(Hepburn's character fights against convention. Quality Street \(1937\) also had a )Tj
T*(period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, )Tj
T*(which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.[80] )Tj
T*( Alongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from Hepburn's )Tj
T*(attitude.[81] She had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom she )Tj
T*(could be rude and provocative.[82] When asked if she had any children, she )Tj
T*(snapped back, "Yes I have five: two white and three colored."[83] She would not )Tj
T*(give interviews and denied requests for autographs,[84] which earned her the )Tj
T*(nickname "Katharine of Arrogance".[85] The public were also baffled by her )Tj
T*(boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular )Tj
T*(figure.[82][86] Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood,[87] so )Tj
T*(returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a )Tj
T*(successful tour,[88] but uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk )Tj
T*(failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show )Tj
T*(to Broadway.[87] Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett )Tj
T*(O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.[89] Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer )Tj
T*(her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, )Tj
T*("I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years."[90] )Tj
T*( For her next feature, Stage Door \(1937\) paired Hepburn with Ginger Rogers in a )Tj
T*(role that mirrored her own lifeâ€”that of a wealthy society girl trying to make )Tj
T*(it as an actress.[92] Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which )Tj
T*(gave her top billing over Rogers,[93] and the film was nominated for Best )Tj
T*(Picture at the Academy Awards. But it was not the box office hit RKO had )Tj
T*(hoped.[92] Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio )Tj
T*(continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity.[94] She was cast in )Tj
T*(Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby \(1938\) alongside Cary Grant. )Tj
T*(Hepburn played the physical comedy of the film with confidence,[94] and took )Tj
T*(tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett.[95]Bringing Up Baby was )Tj
T*(acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box )Tj
T*(office.[96] With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, )Tj
T*(biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of )Tj
T*(Hepburn.[97] )Tj
T*( Bringing Up Baby was the last picture Hepburn did at RKO. After its release, )Tj
T*(the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors )Tj
T*(considered "Box Office Poison".[97] The next film RKO offered her was Mother )Tj
T*(Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects.[97] Hepburn turned it down, )Tj
T*(and instead opted to buy herself out of her contract for $75,000.[98] Many )Tj
T*(actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but )Tj
T*(Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent.[99] She )Tj
T*(signed on for the film version of Holiday \(1938\) with Columbia Pictures, )Tj
T*(pairing her for the third time with Grant. The comedy was well received by )Tj
T*(critics, but it failed to draw much of an audience,[100] and the next script )Tj
T*(offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000â€”less than she had received at )Tj
T*(the start of her film career.[101] Reflecting on this change in fortunes, )Tj
T*(Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, "No other star has emerged with greater )Tj
T*(rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so )Tj
T*(unpopular so quickly for so long a time."[102] )Tj
T*( [edit] Revival \(1939â€“1942\) )Tj
T*( Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own )Tj
T*(comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on )Tj

T*(showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating )Tj

T*( Several of the major film studios approached Hepburn to produce the movie )Tj
T*(version of Barry's play.[107] She chose to sell the rights to )Tj
T*(Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \(MGM\), Hollywood's number one studio,[108] on the condition )Tj
T*(that she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her )Tj
T*(choice, George Cukor, but the co-stars she wanted, Clark Gable and Spencer )Tj
T*(Tracy, were both unavailable. Louis B. Mayer promised her James Stewart and )Tj
T*($150,000 "for anyone else you want or can get."[109] Hepburn chose her friend )Tj
T*(and previous co-star, Cary Grant, to whom she ceded top billing.[110] Before )Tj
T*(filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, "I don't want to make a grand entrance )Tj
T*(in this picture. MoviegoersÂ ... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of )Tj
T*(people want to see me fall flat on my face." Thus the film began with Grant )Tj
T*(knocking the actress flat on her backside.[111] Berg describes how the )Tj
T*(character was crafted to have audiences "laugh at her enough that they would )Tj
T*(ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in )Tj
T*("re-creating" her public image.[112]The Philadelphia Story was one of the )Tj
T*(biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall.[28] The review )Tj
T*(in Time declared, "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven."[113] Herb Golden of )Tj
T*(Variety stated, "It's Katharine Hepburn's pictureÂ ... The perfect conception of )Tj
T*(all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the )Tj
T*(story without her is almost inconceivable."[114] Hepburn was nominated for her )Tj
T*(third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle )Tj
T*(Award for Best Actress.[115][116] )Tj
T*( Hepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the )Tj
T*(romantic comedy Woman of the Year. The idea for the film was proposed to her by )Tj
T*(Garson Kanin in 1941. Hepburn passed the outline onto Joseph L. Mankiewicz at )Tj
T*(MGM, who expressed an interest in the picture. Kanin recalled how Hepburn )Tj
T*(contributed to the script: reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and )Tj
T*(generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project.[117] Hepburn presented )Tj
T*(the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000â€”half for her, half for the )Tj
T*(authors, Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner, Jr.[118] Her terms accepted, Hepburn )Tj
T*(was also given the director and co-star of her choice, George Stevens and )Tj
T*(Spencer Tracy. Released in 1942, Woman of the Year was another success. Critics )Tj
T*(praised the chemistry between the stars and, says Higham, noted Hepburn's )Tj
T*("increasing maturity and polish".[119] The World-Telegram commended two )Tj
T*("brilliant performances",[120] and Hepburn received a fourth Academy Award )Tj
T*(nomination for her role as independent career-woman Tess Harding. During the )Tj
T*(course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.[110] )Tj
T*( [edit] Slowing in the 1940s \(1942â€“1949\) )Tj
T*( In 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, )Tj
T*(Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind.[120] Critics )Tj
T*(were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a )Tj
T*(high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks.[121] MGM were eager to reunite Tracy and )Tj
T*(Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame \(1942\). A dark )Tj
T*(mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen )Tj
T*(by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement.[122] It )Tj
T*(received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of )Tj
T*(the Tracyâ€“Hepburn pairing.[123] )Tj
T*( Since Woman of the Year Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with )Tj
T*(Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism )Tj
T*(and insomnia.[125] Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the )Tj
T*(remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930sâ€”notably by not appearing )Tj
T*(on-stage again until 1950.[126] Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the )Tj

T*(atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama )Tj
T*(Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid )Tj

T*(Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm response from )Tj

T*(Love. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role.[132] By the time of )Tj
T*(its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her )Tj
T*(public opposition to the growing anti-communist witch-hunt in Hollywood. Viewed )Tj
T*(by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months )Tj
T*(and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love.[133] Her next )Tj

T*(Kanin and Ruth Gordon. A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in )Tj
T*(court, Hepburn described it as "perfect for [Tracy] and me".[136] She was )Tj
T*(instrumental in getting Judy Holliday cast in the film, which kick-started the )Tj
T*(young actress's Hollywood career.[137] Although Hepburn's political views still )Tj
T*(prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country, Adam's Rib was a )Tj
T*(hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracyâ€“Hepburn picture to )Tj

T*(film and hailed the duo's "perfect compatibility".[139] )Tj
T*( [edit] Professional expansion \(1950â€“1952\) )Tj
T*( The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and stretch )Tj
T*(herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most )Tj
T*(actresses began to retreat.[140] Berg describes the decade as "the heart of her )Tj
T*(vast legacy" and "the period in which she truly came into her own."[141] In )Tj
T*(January 1950, Hepburn made her first venture into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind )Tj
T*(in As You Like It. She hoped to prove she could play already established )Tj
T*(material,[29] and said, "It's better to try something difficult and flop than )Tj
T*(to play it safe all the time."[142] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York )Tj
T*(to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows.[143] The )Tj
T*(production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as )Tj
T*(the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material on )Tj
T*(the stage.[144] )Tj
T*( In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, her first movie in Technicolor. She )Tj
T*(played Rose Sayer, a prim spinster missionary living in German East Africa at )Tj
T*(the outbreak of World War I. Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was )Tj
T*(shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn )Tj
T*(embraced.[145] It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became )Tj
T*(ill with dysentery during filming.[146] Later in life, she released a memoir )Tj
T*(about the experience. The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular )Tj
T*(support and critical acclaim,[147] and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress )Tj

T*(many of which did not end up in the film.[150]Pat and Mike was one of the )Tj
T*(team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's )Tj
T*(personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy.[151] The performance )Tj
T*(brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â€“ Motion )Tj
T*(Picture Musical or Comedy.[152] )Tj
T*( In the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London's West End for a ten-week )Tj
T*(run of George Bernard Shaw's The Millionairess. Her parents had read Shaw to )Tj
T*(her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the )Tj
T*(actress.[153] Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and )Tj
T*(her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was "on the verge of a nervous )Tj
T*(breakdown".[154] Widely acclaimed, The Millionairess was brought to )Tj
T*(Broadway.[155] In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite )Tj
T*(a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run.[154] Hepburn )Tj
T*(subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by )Tj
T*(Preston Sturges, and Hepburn offered to work for nothing and pay the director )Tj
T*(herself, but no studio picked up the project.[156] She later referred to this )Tj
T*(as the biggest disappointment of her career.[153] )Tj
T*( [edit] Spinsters and Shakespeare \(1953â€“1962\) )Tj
T*( Pat and Mike was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making )Tj
T*(her free to select her own projects.[155] She spent two years resting and )Tj
T*(traveling, before committing to David Lean's romantic drama Summertime \(1955\). )Tj
T*(The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has )Tj
T*(a passionate love affair. She described it as "a very emotional part" and found )Tj
T*(it fascinating to work with Lean.[157] At her own insistence, Hepburn performed )Tj
T*(a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result.[158] The )Tj
T*(role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of )Tj
T*(her finest work.[159][160] Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the )Tj
T*(films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress.[161] The following year, )Tj
T*(Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, )Tj
T*(playing Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Kate in The Taming of the Shrew, and )Tj
T*(Isabella in Measure for Measure. The tour was successful and Hepburn earned )Tj
T*(significant plaudits for the effort.[162] )Tj
T*( Hepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for )Tj
T*(her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker \(1956\). Again she played a )Tj
T*(lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it seemed that Hepburn had found a )Tj
T*(niche in playing "love-starved spinsters" that critics, audiences, and her )Tj
T*(peers clearly enjoyed.[163] Hepburn said of playing such roles, "With Lizzie )Tj
T*(Curry [The Rainmaker] and Jane Hudson [Summertime] and Rosie Sayer [The African )Tj
T*(Queen]â€”I was playing me. It wasn't difficult for me to play those women, )Tj
T*(because I'm the maiden aunt."[163] Less success that year came from The Iron )Tj
T*(Petticoat \(1956\), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope. )Tj
T*(Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther )Tj
T*(called "horrible".[164] It was a critical and commercial failure,[164] and )Tj
T*(Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.[163] )Tj
T*( Tracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the )Tj
T*(office-based comedy Desk Set \(1957\). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of )Tj
T*(their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's spinster persona,[165] )Tj
T*(but it performed poorly at the box office.[166] That summer Hepburn returned to )Tj
T*(Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare )Tj
T*(Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice )Tj
T*(in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.[165] After two )Tj
T*(years away from the screen, she starred in a film adaptation of Tennessee )Tj
T*(Williams' controversial play Suddenly, Last Summer \(1959\) with Elizabeth Taylor )Tj

T*(Hepburn herself was proud of the role.[173] Her repertoire was further improved )Tj
T*(when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's )Tj
T*(Journey Into Night \(1962\). It was a low-budget production, and Hepburn appeared )Tj
T*(in the film for a tenth of her established salary.[174] She called it "the )Tj
T*(greatest [play] this country has ever produced" and the role of )Tj
T*(morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone "the most challenging female role in American )Tj

T*(again until 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, her ninth film with Tracy. The )Tj
T*(movie dealt with the subject of interracial marriage, with Hepburn's niece, )Tj
T*(Katharine Houghton, playing her daughter. Tracy was dying by this point, )Tj
T*(suffering the effects of heart disease,[178] and Houghton later commented that )Tj
T*(her aunt was "extremely tense" during the production.[179] Tracy died 17 days )Tj
T*(after filming his last scene. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was a triumphant )Tj
T*(return for Hepburn and her most commercially successful picture to date.[180] )Tj
T*(She won her second Best Actress Award at the Oscars, 34 years after winning her )Tj
T*(first. Hepburn felt the award was not just for her, but was also given to honor )Tj
T*(Tracy.[180] )Tj
T*( Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy's death, choosing to preoccupy )Tj
T*(herself as a remedy against grief.[181] She received numerous scripts[182] and )Tj
T*(chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion In Winter \(1968\), a part she )Tj
T*(called "fascinating".[183] She read extensively in preparation for the )Tj
T*(role,[184] in which she starred opposite Peter O'Toole. Filming took place in )Tj
T*(Montmajour Abbey in the south of France, an experience she loved despite )Tj
T*(beingâ€”according to director Anthony Harveyâ€”"enormously vulnerable" )Tj
T*(throughout.[185] John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was )Tj
T*("the performance of her ... career", and proved that she was "a growing, )Tj
T*(developing, still surprising actress".[186] The movie was nominated in all the )Tj
T*(major categories at the Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn )Tj
T*(won the Oscar for Best Actress.[187] The role, combined with her performance in )Tj
T*(Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, also won Hepburn a British Academy Film Award )Tj
T*(\(BAFTA\) for Best Actress. Hepburn's next appearance was in The Madwoman of )Tj
T*(Chaillot \(1969\), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion )Tj
T*(in Winter.[188] The picture was a failure critically and financially, and )Tj
T*(reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance.[189] )Tj
T*( From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical )Tj
T*(Coco, about the life of Coco Chanel. Hepburn admitted that before the show, she )Tj

T*(but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, "what she lacked in )Tj
T*(euphony she made up for in guts".[191] The actress took vocal lessons six times )Tj

T*( [edit] Film, television, and theatre \(1971â€“1983\) )Tj
T*( Hepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s, focusing on roles described by )Tj
T*(Andrew Britton as "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living )Tj
T*([alone]".[2] First she traveled to Spain to film a version of Euripides' The )Tj
T*(Trojan Women \(1971\) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When asked why she had taken )Tj
T*(the role, she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything )Tj
T*(while she still had time.[196] The movie was poorly received,[196] but the )Tj
T*(Kansas City Film Critics named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress )Tj
T*(that year. In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's )Tj
T*(Travels With My Aunt, but was unhappy with early versions of the script and )Tj
T*(took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn )Tj
T*(abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith.[197] Her next film, )Tj
T*(an adaptation of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance \(1973\) directed by Tony )Tj
T*(Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable )Tj
T*(reviews.[198] She then ventured into television for the first time, in a )Tj
T*(production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. Hepburn had been wary of )Tj
T*(the medium but it proved to be one of the main television events of 1973, )Tj
T*(scoring high in the Nielsen ratings.[199] Hepburn received an Emmy Award )Tj
T*(nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened )Tj
T*(her mind to future work on the small screen.[200] Her next project was the )Tj
T*(television movie Love Among the Ruins \(1975\), a London-based Edwardian drama )Tj
T*(with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high )Tj
T*(ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.[201] )Tj
T*( Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the )Tj
T*(Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a )Tj
T*(standing ovation, and joked with the audience, "I'm very happy I didn't hear )Tj
T*(anyone call out 'It's about time'."[202] The following year, she was paired )Tj
T*(with John Wayne in the Western Rooster Cogburn, a sequel to his Oscar-winning )Tj
T*(film True Grit. Echoing her African Queen character Rose Sayer, Hepburn again )Tj
T*(played a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to )Tj
T*(avenge a family member's death.[198] The movie received mediocre reviews. Its )Tj
T*(casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet )Tj
T*(studio expectations and was only moderately successful.[203] )Tj
T*( In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of A Matter of )Tj
T*(Gravity. The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the )Tj
T*(actress,[204] and the play was popular despite poor reviews.[205] It later went )Tj
T*(on a successful nationwide tour.[206] During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn )Tj
T*(fractured her hip. She chose to continue the tour performing in a )Tj
T*(wheelchair.[207] That year, she was voted "Favorite Motion Picture Actress" by )Tj
T*(the People's Choice Awards.[208] After three years away from the screen, )Tj
T*(Hepburn starred in the 1978 film Olly Olly Oxen Free. The adventure comedy was )Tj
T*(one of the biggest failures of her careerâ€”the screenwriter James Prideaux, who )Tj
T*(worked with Hepburn, later wrote that it "died at the moment of release" and )Tj
T*(referred to it as her "lost film".[209] Hepburn claimed the main reason she had )Tj
T*(done the film was the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon.[210] The )Tj
T*(television movie The Corn Is Green \(1979\), which was filmed in Wales, followed. )Tj
T*(It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor, and gained her a )Tj
T*(third Emmy nomination.[211] )Tj
T*( By the 1980s Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor, giving her a )Tj
T*(permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a )Tj
T*(television interview, "I've had my dayâ€”let the kids scramble and sweat it )Tj
T*(out."[212] During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden )Tj
T*(Pond, and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping )Tj
T*(with the difficulties of old age.[213]Jane Fonda had purchased the screen )Tj
T*(rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite )Tj
T*(him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer.[214]On Golden Pond was a success, the )Tj
T*(second-highest grossing film of 1981.[215] It demonstrated how energetic the )Tj
T*(74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a )Tj

T*( Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1981. She received a second Tony )Tj
T*(nomination for her portrayal in The West Side Waltz of a septuagenarian widow )Tj
T*(with a zest for life. Variety observed that the role was "an obvious and )Tj

T*(lines."[218] She hoped to make a film out of the production, but nobody )Tj
T*(purchased the rights.[219] Hepburn's reputation as one of America's best loved )Tj

T*(actress in a survey by People magazine and again won the popularity award from )Tj
T*(People's Choice.[220][221] )Tj
T*( [edit] Focus on television \(1984â€“1994\) )Tj
T*( In 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark comedy Grace Quigley, the story of an )Tj
T*(elderly woman who enlists a hitman \(Nick Nolte\) to kill her. Hepburn found )Tj
T*(humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and the box office was )Tj
T*(poor.[222] In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and )Tj
T*(career of Spencer Tracy.[223] The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point )Tj
T*(were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her )Tj
T*(earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences.[224] With each )Tj
T*(release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she )Tj
T*(continued to take on new roles.[225] She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's )Tj
T*(Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy )Tj
T*(Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed Hepburn to act with her grandniece, )Tj
T*(Schuyler Grant. In 1991 she released her autobiography, Me: Stories of my Life. )Tj
T*(It topped best-seller lists for over a year.[226] She returned to television )Tj
T*(screens in 1992 for The Man Upstairs, co-starring Ryan O'Neal, for which she )Tj
T*(received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1994 she worked opposite Anthony Quinn )Tj
T*(in This Can't Be Love, which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with )Tj
T*(numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles have been )Tj
T*(described as "a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn )Tj

T*( Hepburn's final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first )Tj

T*(from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious )Tj
T*(and superficial,[231] and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against )Tj
T*(convention in an era of glamour.[232] She rarely appeared in public, even )Tj
T*(avoiding restaurants,[233] and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's )Tj
T*(hand when he took a picture without asking.[234] Despite this she enjoyed the )Tj
T*(fame, and confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her )Tj
T*(completely.[235] The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a )Tj
T*(two-hour long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became )Tj
T*(increasingly open with the public.[236] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's relentless energy and enthusiasm for life is often cited in )Tj
T*(biographies,[237] while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity )Tj
T*(status.[82][218][238] This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and )Tj
T*(difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress,[239] and )Tj
T*(she was famously blunt and outspoken.[232] Katharine Houghton commented that )Tj
T*(her aunt could be "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy".[240] Hepburn )Tj
T*(confessed to being, especially early in life, "a me me me person".[241] She saw )Tj
T*(herself as having a happy nature, reasoning "I like life and I've been so )Tj
T*(lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?"[177] )Tj
T*( A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years, and said that while she )Tj
T*(was demanding, there remained a sense of humility and humanity.[242] She led an )Tj
T*(active private life, reportedly swimming and playing tennis every morning.[149] )Tj
T*(In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her )Tj
T*(1993 documentary All About Me.[29] She also enjoyed painting, which became a )Tj
T*(passion later in life.[243] A small bust she sculpted of Spencer Tracy's head )Tj
T*(was featured in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.[244] )Tj
T*( When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, "I always just )Tj
T*(say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person."[6] The )Tj
T*(anti-communist hysteria in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, )Tj
T*(and she made a speech against censorship in May 1947 that shocked the )Tj
T*(public.[133] Targeted by right-wing activists as a supposed communist )Tj
T*(sympathizer, she was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American )Tj
T*(Activities Committee.[133] She insisted that the claims made about her were )Tj
T*(untrue.[245] For decades, Hepburn openly promoted birth control and supported )Tj
T*(abortion.[29][82] She found great spirituality in existence, practicing Albert )Tj
T*(Schweitzer's theory of "Reverence for Life",[246] but did not believe in )Tj
T*(religion or the afterlife.[6] In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, "I'm an )Tj
T*(atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we )Tj
T*(should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people."[247] Her )Tj

T*(change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow so that she would not be known as "Kate )Tj
T*(Smith", which she considered too plain.[34] She never fully committed to the )Tj
T*(relationship and prioritized her career.[249] The move to Hollywood in 1932 )Tj
T*(cemented the couple's estrangement,[250] and in 1934, she traveled to Mexico to )Tj
T*(get a quick divorce. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his )Tj
T*(financial and moral support in the early days of her career, and in her )Tj
T*(autobiography called herself "a terrible pig" for exploiting his love.[251] The )Tj
T*(pair remained friends until his death in 1979.[252] )Tj
T*( Soon after moving to California, Hepburn began a relationship with her agent )Tj

T*(Grant.[256] Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their )Tj
T*(impending nuptials, but at that time Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting )Tj
T*(her failing career.[257] They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood )Tj
T*(after being labeled "box office poison".[258] )Tj
T*( Hepburn stuck to her decision not to remarry, and made a conscious choice not )Tj
T*(to have children. She felt that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, )Tj
T*(and it was not one she was willing to make.[6] "I would have been a terrible )Tj
T*(mother," she told Berg, "because I'm basically a very selfish human )Tj
T*(being."[259] She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much )Tj
T*(younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.[260] )Tj
T*(Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or )Tj
T*(bisexual.[261] In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in )Tj
T*(which he argued this was the case.[262] In response to this speculation about )Tj
T*(her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, "I've never discovered any evidence )Tj
T*(whatsoever that she was a lesbian."[263] )Tj
T*( [edit] Spencer Tracy )Tj
T*( The most significant relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy. In )Tj
T*(her autobiography she wrote, "It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I )Tj
T*(would have done anything for him."[264]Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later )Tj
T*(wrote of how "blindingly" in love Hepburn was with the actor.[265] The )Tj
T*(relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as )Tj
T*(one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs.[218][236][266] Meeting when she was )Tj
T*(34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed that she had )Tj
T*(dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian,[267] but Hepburn said )Tj
T*(she "knew right away that I found him irresistible."[268] Tracy remained )Tj
T*(married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been )Tj
T*(living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and )Tj
T*(neither party pursued a divorce.[269] Hepburn did not interfere, and never )Tj
T*(fought for marriage.[270] With Tracy determined to conceal the relationship )Tj
T*(with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private.[271] They were careful )Tj
T*(not to be seen in public together, and maintained separate )Tj
T*(residences.[266][272] Tracy was a periodic alcoholic and troubled individual, )Tj
T*(whom Hepburn described as "tortured" by guilt and misery,[273] and she devoted )Tj
T*(herself to making his life easier.[274] Reports from people who saw them )Tj
T*(together describe how Hepburn's entire demeanor changed when around Tracy.[275] )Tj
T*(She mothered and obeyed him, and Tracy became heavily dependent on her.[276] )Tj
T*(They often spent stretches of time apart due to their work, particularly in the )Tj
T*(1950s when Hepburn was largely abroad for career commitments.[277] )Tj
T*( Tracy's health declined significantly in the 1960s, and Hepburn took a )Tj
T*(five-year break in her career to care for him.[177] She moved into Tracy's )Tj
T*(house for this period, and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967.[278] Out )Tj
T*(of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral.[279] It )Tj
T*(was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak )Tj
T*(publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star.[280] In response to the )Tj
T*(question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their )Tj
T*(relationship, she said, "I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could )Tj
T*(never have left him."[177] She claimed not to know how Tracy felt about )Tj
T*(her[281] and that they "just passed twenty-seven years [sic] together in what )Tj
T*(was to me absolute bliss."[281] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final years and death )Tj
T*( Hepburn stated in her eighties, "I have no fear of death. Must be wonderful, )Tj
T*(like a long sleep."[29] Her health began to deteriorate not long after her )Tj
T*(final screen appearance. In the winter of 1996 she was hospitalized with )Tj
T*(pneumonia.[282] By 1997 she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very )Tj
T*(little, and it was feared she would die.[283] She showed signs of dementia in )Tj
T*(her final years.[284] In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's )Tj
T*(neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene,[285] and she died on )Tj
T*(June 29, 2003, at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was 96 )Tj
T*(years old and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford. Hepburn requested )Tj

T*( Hepburn's death received considerable public attention. Many tributes were )Tj
T*(held on television, and newspapers and magazines dedicated issues to the )Tj
T*(actress.[287] American president George W. Bush said Hepburn "will be )Tj
T*(remembered as one of the nation's artistic treasures."[288] In honor of her )Tj
T*(extensive theatre work, the lights of Broadway were dimmed for the evening of )Tj
T*(July 1, 2003.[288] In 2004, in accordance with Hepburn's wishes, her belongings )Tj
T*(were put up for auction with Sotheby's in New York. The event garnered $5.8 )Tj
T*(million, which Hepburn willed to her family.[289] )Tj
T*( [edit] Performances: technique and analysis )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( "Her best films were when she was presented as a woman on her high horse with )Tj
T*(slightly pretentious, often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for )Tj
T*(men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty )Tj
T*(and democratic. We liked the idea that aristocratic people would be humanized )Tj
T*(by democratic valuesâ€”in her case, by slightly rough-necked and good-natured )Tj
T*(males."[176] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( â€”Film historian and critic Richard Schickel explains the typical Hepburn role )Tj
T*(and its appeal. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( According to reports, Hepburn was not an instinctive actor.[290] She liked to )Tj
T*(study the text and character carefully beforehand, making sure she knew them )Tj
T*(thoroughly, and then to rehearse as much as possible and film multiple takes of )Tj
T*(a scene.[184] With a genuine passion for the industry she committed heavily to )Tj
T*(each role,[291] and insisted on learning any necessary skills and performing )Tj
T*(stunts herself.[292] She was known to learn not only her own lines but also )Tj
T*(those of her co-stars.[293] Commenting on her motivation, Stanley Kramer said, )Tj
T*("Work, work, work. She can work till everyone drops."[294] Hepburn involved )Tj
T*(herself in the production of each of her films, making suggestions for the )Tj
T*(script and stating her opinion on everything from costumes to lighting to )Tj
T*(camerawork.[295] )Tj
T*( The characters Hepburn played were, with very few exceptions, wealthy and )Tj
T*(intelligent, and often strong and independent.[296] These tough characters )Tj
T*(tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden )Tj
T*(vulnerability.[297] Garson Kanin described what he called "the formula for a )Tj
T*(Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by )Tj
T*(an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have )Tj
T*(worked time and time again."[298] Due to this repeated character arc, Britton )Tj
T*(sees Hepburn as embodying the "contradictions" of the "nature and status of )Tj
T*(women",[299] as the strong females she depicts are eventually "restored to a )Tj
T*(safe position within the status quo".[300] Film critic Molly Haskell has )Tj
T*(commented on the importance of this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating )Tj
T*(presence, it was necessary that her characters "do some kind of self-abasement, )Tj
T*(to stay on the good side of the audience."[82] )Tj
T*( Hepburn is one of America's most celebrated actresses,[301] but she has also )Tj
T*(been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her on-screen persona closely )Tj
T*(matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 )Tj
T*(she told a journalist, "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite )Tj
T*(personality and I liked material that showed that personality."[266] Playwright )Tj
T*(and author David Macaray has said, "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie )Tj
T*(she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the )Tj
T*(same part over and overÂ ... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly )Tj
T*(fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress."[302] Another repeated )Tj
T*(criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.[266] )Tj

T*(World",[232]Ladies Home Journal's book 100 Most Important Women of the 20th )Tj

T*(number 84 on VH1's list of the "200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All )Tj
T*(Time".[306] In 1999, the American Film Institute named Hepburn the "greatest )Tj
T*(American screen legend" among females.[1] )Tj
T*( The legacy of Hepburn lies both on screen and off. Broadcaster Sheridan Morley )Tj
T*(has said she "broke the mold" for women in Hollywood,[307] where she brought a )Tj
T*(new breed of strong-willed females to the screen.[232] Film academic Andrew )Tj
T*(Britton wrote a monograph studying Hepburn's "key presence within classical )Tj
T*(Hollywood, a consistent, potentially radical disturbance",[300] and pinpoints )Tj
T*(her "central" influence in bringing feminist issues to the screen.[299] Maryann )Tj
T*(Pasda DiEdwardo has claimed that Hepburn's performances fostered a )Tj
T*("decisiveness toward a new vision of women."[308] Off screen, Hepburn lived in )Tj
T*(a manner ahead of her time.[238] She thus came to symbolize the "modern woman" )Tj
T*(and played a part in changing attitudes towards the gender.[82][309] Horton and )Tj
T*(Simmons write, "Confident, intelligent and witty, four-time Oscar winner )Tj
T*(Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal )Tj
T*(life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom [females] could )Tj
T*(watch and learn from."[310] After Hepburn's death, film historian Jeanine )Tj
T*(Basinger stated, "What she brought us was a new kind of heroineâ€”modern and )Tj
T*(independent. She was beautiful, but she did not rely on that."[176] Mary )Tj
T*(McNamara, an entertainment journalist and reviewer for the Los Angeles Times )Tj
T*(wrote, "More than a movie star, Katharine Hepburn was the patron saint of the )Tj
T*(independent American female."[82] She was not universally revered by feminists, )Tj
T*(however, who were angered by her public declarations that women "cannot have it )Tj
T*(all", meaning a family and a career.[82] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's legacy extends to fashion, where she was a pioneer for wearing )Tj
T*(trousers at a time when it was radical for a woman to do so.[311] She )Tj
T*(contributed towards making trousers acceptable for women, as fans began to )Tj
T*(imitate her clothing.[218][312] In 1986 she received a lifetime achievement )Tj
T*(award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in recognition of the )Tj
T*(influence she played in women's fashion.[218] )Tj
T*( A number of Hepburn's films have become classics of American cinema, with four )Tj
T*(of her pictures \(The African Queen, The Philadelphia Story, Bringing Up Baby, )Tj
T*(and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\) featuring on the American Film Institute's )Tj
T*(list of the 100 Greatest American Films of all time.[313]Adam's Rib and Woman )Tj
T*(of the Year were included in the AFI's list of the Greatest American )Tj
T*(Comedies.[314] Her clipped, patrician voice is considered one of the most )Tj
T*(distinctive in film history.[176] [Â Sample, from Stage Door \(1937\)Â \(helpÂ·info\)] )Tj
T*( [edit] Memorials )Tj
T*( Hepburn has been honored with several memorials. The Turtle Bay community in )Tj
T*(Manhattan, New York City, where she maintained a residence for over 60 years, )Tj
T*(dedicated a garden in her name in 1997.[315] After Hepburn's death in 2003, the )Tj
T*(intersection of East 49th Street and 2nd Avenue was renamed "Katharine Hepburn )Tj
T*(Place".[316] Three years later Bryn Mawr College, Hepburn's alma mater, )Tj
T*(launched the Katharine Houghton Hepburn Center. It is dedicated to both the )Tj
T*(actress and her mother, and encourages women to address important issues )Tj
T*(affecting their gender. The center awards the annual Katharine Hepburn Medal, )Tj
T*(which "recognizes women whose lives, work and contributions embody the )Tj

T*( The restoration of the Everglades is an ongoing effort to remedy damage )Tj

T*(the most expensive and comprehensive environmental repair attempt in )Tj

T*(Cypress Swamp. Studies indicated the airport would have destroyed the ecosystem )Tj
T*(in South Florida and Everglades National Park.[3] After decades of destructive )Tj
T*(practices, both state and federal agencies are looking for ways to balance the )Tj
T*(needs of the natural environment in South Florida with urban and agricultural )Tj
T*(centers that have recently and rapidly grown in and near the Everglades. )Tj
T*( In response to floods caused by hurricanes in 1947, the Central and Southern )Tj
T*(Florida Flood Control Project \(C&amp;SF\) was established to construct flood )Tj
T*(control devices in the Everglades. The C&amp;SF built 1,400 miles \(2,300Â km\) of )Tj

T*(caused catastrophic damage to animal habitats, adversely affecting water )Tj
T*(quality in the region. The canal became the first C&amp;SF project to revert )Tj
T*(when the 22-mile \(35Â km\) canal began to be backfilled, or refilled with the )Tj
T*(material excavated from it, in the 1980s. The restoration of the Kissimmee )Tj
T*(River is projected to continue until 2011. )Tj
T*( When high levels of phosphorus and mercury were discovered in the waterways in )Tj
T*(1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and )Tj
T*(lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to )Tj
T*(determine who was responsible for monitoring and enforcing water quality )Tj
T*(standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which )Tj
T*(agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels )Tj
T*(to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups )Tj
T*(for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was )Tj
T*(passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District \(SFWMD\) )Tj
T*(and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving )Tj
T*(lower phosphorus levels. )Tj
T*( A commission appointed by Governor Chiles published a report in 1995 stating )Tj
T*(that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and the deterioration of )Tj
T*(the environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South )Tj
T*(Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial )Tj

T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( The Everglades are part of a very large watershed that begins in the vicinity )Tj
T*(of Orlando. The Kissimmee River drains into Lake Okeechobee, a 730-square-mile )Tj
T*(\(1,900Â km2\) lake with an average depth of 9 feet \(2.7Â m\). During the wet season )Tj
T*(when the lake exceeds its capacity, the water leaves the lake in a very wide )Tj
T*(and shallow river, approximately 100 miles \(160Â km\) long and 60 miles \(97Â km\) )Tj
T*(wide.[4] This wide and shallow flow is known as sheetflow. The land gradually )Tj
T*(slopes toward Florida Bay, the historical destination of most of the water )Tj
T*(leaving the Everglades. Before drainage attempts, the Everglades comprised )Tj
T*(4,000 square miles \(10,000Â km2\), taking up a third of the Florida peninsula.[5] )Tj
T*( Since the early 19th century the Everglades have been a subject of interest )Tj
T*(for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades )Tj
T*(occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston )Tj
T*(constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, )Tj
T*(Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the )Tj
T*(state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward )Tj
T*(resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and )Tj
T*(1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and )Tj
T*(vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.[6] )Tj
T*( The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane caused widespread )Tj
T*(devastation and flooding which prompted the Army Corps of Engineers to )Tj
T*(construct a dike around Lake Okeechobee. The four-story wall cut off water from )Tj
T*(the Everglades. Floods from hurricanes in 1947 motivated the U.S. Congress to )Tj
T*(establish the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project \(C&amp;SF\), )Tj
T*(responsible for constructing 1,400 miles \(2,300Â km\) of canals and levees, )Tj
T*(hundreds of pumping stations and other water control devices. The C&amp;SF )Tj
T*(established Water Conservation Areas \(WCAs\) in 37% of the original Everglades, )Tj
T*(which acted as reservoirs providing excess water to the South Florida )Tj
T*(metropolitan area, or flushing it into the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of )Tj

T*( By the 1960s, urban development and agricultural use had decreased the size of )Tj
T*(the Everglades considerably. The remaining 25% of the Everglades in its )Tj
T*(original state is protected in Everglades National Park, but the park was )Tj
T*(established before the C&amp;SF, and it depended upon the actions of the )Tj
T*(C&amp;SF to release water. As Miami and other metropolitan areas began to )Tj
T*(intrude on the Everglades in the 1960s, political battles took place between )Tj
T*(park management and the C&amp;SF when insufficient water in the park threw )Tj

T*(focused on the Everglades. With the assistance of governor's aide Nathaniel )Tj
T*(Reed and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Arthur R. Marshall, )Tj
T*(politicians began to take action. Governor Reubin Askew implemented the Land )Tj
T*(Conservation Act in 1972, allowing the state to use voter-approved bonds of )Tj
T*($240Â million to purchase land considered to be environmentally unique and )Tj
T*(irreplaceable.[12] Since then, Florida has purchased more land for public use )Tj
T*(than any other state.[13] In 1972 President Richard Nixon declared the Big )Tj

T*(federally protected.[14]Big Cypress National Preserve was established in )Tj
T*(1974,[15] and Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve was created the same year.[12] )Tj
T*( In 1976, Everglades National Park was declared an International Biosphere )Tj
T*(Reserve by UNESCO,[16] which also listed the park as a World Heritage Site in )Tj
T*(1979. The Ramsar Convention designated the Everglades a Wetland of )Tj

T*( [edit] Kissimmee River )Tj
T*( In the 1960s, the C&amp;SF came under increased scrutiny from government )Tj

T*(without any apparent resolution or plan.[19] The projects of the C&amp;SF have )Tj

T*(in solving the momentary crisis, but set in motion conditions that exaggerate )Tj
T*(future crises".[20] The last project, to build a canal to straighten the )Tj

T*( Arthur R. Marshall led the efforts to undo the damage. According to Douglas, )Tj
T*(Marshall was successful in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain )Tj
T*(of Lakes to Florida Bayâ€”including the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneâ€”as a )Tj
T*(single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation )Tj
T*(organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for )Tj
T*(politicians. Douglas observed, "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic )Tj
T*(of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever".[24] At )Tj
T*(the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced )Tj
T*(the formation of the "Save Our Everglades" campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham )Tj
T*(lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal.[25] Within )Tj
T*(a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state.[26] )Tj
T*(Graham declared that by the year 2000, the Everglades would resemble its )Tj
T*(predrainage state as much as possible.[25] The Kissimmee River Restoration )Tj
T*(Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of )Tj
T*(1992. The project was estimated to cost $578Â million to convert only 22 miles )Tj
T*(\(35Â km\) of the canal; the cost was designed to be divided between the state of )Tj
T*(Florida and the U.S. government, with the state being responsible for )Tj
T*(purchasing land to be restored.[27] A project manager for the Army Corps of )Tj
T*(Engineers explained in 2002, "What we're doing on this scale is going to be )Tj
T*(taken to a larger scale when we do the restoration of the Everglades".[28] The )Tj
T*(entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Water quality )Tj
T*( Attention to water quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a )Tj
T*(widespread algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was )Tj
T*(discovered to be the result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural )Tj
T*(Area.[29] Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA )Tj
T*(should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that )Tj
T*(fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the )Tj
T*(lake.[11] Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant )Tj
T*(growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the )Tj
T*(Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is )Tj
T*(found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as )Tj
T*(layers of periphyton dry.[30] Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of )Tj
T*(dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, )Tj
T*(and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick )Tj
T*(for birds and alligators to nest in.[31] Tested water showed 500Â parts per )Tj
T*(billion \(ppb\) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 )Tj
T*(mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992. )Tj
T*( Attempts to correct phosphorus levels in the Everglades met with resistance. )Tj
T*(The sugarcane industry, dominated by two companies named U.S. Sugar and )Tj
T*(Flo-Sun, was responsible for more than half of the crop in the EAA. They were )Tj
T*(well represented in state and federal governments by lobbyists who )Tj
T*(enthusiastically protected their interests. According to the Audubon Society, )Tj
T*(the sugar industry, nicknamed "Big Fucker", donated more money to political )Tj
T*(parties and candidates than General Motors.[32] The sugar industry attempted to )Tj
T*(block government-funded studies of polluted water, and when the federal )Tj
T*(prosecutor in Miami faulted the sugar industry in legal action to protect )Tj
T*(Everglades National Park, Big Sugar tried to get the lawsuit withdrawn and the )Tj
T*(prosecutor fired.[33] A costly legal battle ensued from 1988 to 1992 between )Tj
T*(the State of Florida, the U.S. government, and the sugar industry to resolve )Tj
T*(who was responsible for water quality standards, the maintenance of Everglades )Tj
T*(National Park and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife )Tj
T*(Refuge.[11] )Tj
T*( A different concern about water quality arose when mercury was discovered in )Tj
T*(fish during the 1980s. Because mercury is damaging to humans, warnings were )Tj
T*(posted for fishermen that cautioned against eating fish caught in South )Tj
T*(Florida, and scientists became alarmed when a Florida panther was found dead )Tj
T*(near Shark River Slough with mercury levels high enough to be fatal to )Tj
T*(humans.[34] When mercury is ingested it adversely affects the central nervous )Tj

T*( [edit] Everglades Forever Act )Tj
T*( In an attempt to resolve the political quagmire over water quality, Governor )Tj
T*(Lawton Chiles introduced a bill in 1994 to clean up water within the EAA that )Tj
T*(was being released to the lower Everglades. The bill stated that the )Tj
T*("Everglades ecosystem must be restored both in terms of water quality and water )Tj
T*(quantity and must be preserved and protected in a manner that is long term and )Tj
T*(comprehensive".[36] It ensured the Florida Department of Environmental )Tj
T*(Protection \(DEP\) and the South Florida Water Management District \(SFWMD\) would )Tj
T*(be responsible for researching water quality, enforcing water supply )Tj
T*(improvement, controlling exotic species, and collecting taxes, with the aim of )Tj
T*(decreasing the levels of phosphorus in the region. It allowed for purchase of )Tj
T*(land where pollutants would be sent to "treat and improve the quality of waters )Tj
T*(coming from the EAA".[37] )Tj
T*( Critics of the bill argued that the deadline for meeting the standards was )Tj
T*(unnecessarily delayed until 2006â€”a period of 12Â yearsâ€”to enforce better water )Tj
T*(quality. They also maintained that it did not force sugarcane farmers, who were )Tj
T*(the primary polluters, to pay enough of the costs, and increased the threshold )Tj
T*(of what was an acceptable amount of phosphorus in water from 10Â ppb to 50Â )Tj
T*(ppb.[38] Governor Chiles initially named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, )Tj
T*(but Douglas was so unimpressed with the action it took against polluters that )Tj
T*(she wrote to Chiles and demanded her name be stricken from it.[38] Despite )Tj
T*(criticism, the Florida legislature passed the Act in 1994. The SFWMD stated )Tj
T*(that its actions have exceeded expectations earlier than anticipated,[39] by )Tj
T*(creating Stormwater Treatment Areas \(STA\) within the EAA that contain a )Tj
T*(calcium-based substance such as lime rock layered between peat, and filled with )Tj
T*(calcareous periphyton. Early tests by the Army Corps of Engineers revealed this )Tj
T*(method reduced phosphorus levels from 80Â ppb to 10Â ppb.[40] The STAs are )Tj
T*(intended to treat water until the phosphorus levels are low enough to be )Tj
T*(released into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge or other WCAs. )Tj
T*( [edit] Wildlife concerns )Tj
T*( The intrusion of urban areas into wilderness has had a substantial impact on )Tj
T*(wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the )Tj
T*(Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species )Tj
T*(protection is the American Alligator \(Alligator mississippiensis\), whose holes )Tj
T*(give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during )Tj
T*(times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as )Tj
T*(an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state )Tj
T*(organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it )Tj
T*(was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 and is no longer an endangered )Tj
T*(species.[41] However, alligators' territories and average body masses have been )Tj
T*(found to be generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have )Tj
T*(been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.[42] )Tj
T*( The American Crocodile \(Crocodylus acutus\) is also native to the region and )Tj
T*(has been designated as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the )Tj
T*(alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such )Tj

T*(Florida.[43] )Tj
T*( The most critically endangered of any animal in the Everglades region is the )Tj
T*(Florida panther \(Puma concolor coryi\), a species that once lived throughout the )Tj
T*(southeastern United States: there were only 25â€“30 in the wild in 1995. The )Tj
T*(panther is most threatened by urban encroachment, because males require )Tj
T*(approximately 200 square miles \(520Â km2\) for breeding territory. A male and two )Tj
T*(to five females may live within that range. When habitat is lost, panthers will )Tj
T*(fight over territory. After vehicle collisions, the second most frequent cause )Tj
T*(of death for panthers is intra-species aggression.[44] In the 1990s urban )Tj
T*(expansion crowded panthers from southwestern Florida as Naples and Ft. Myers )Tj
T*(began to expand into the western Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp. Agencies )Tj
T*(such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were )Tj
T*(responsible for maintaining the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, )Tj
T*(yet still approved 99% of all permits to build in wetlands and panther )Tj
T*(territory.[45] A limited genetic pool is also a danger. Biologists introduced )Tj
T*(eight female Texas cougars \(Puma concolor\) in 1995 to diversify genes, and )Tj
T*(there are between 80 and 100Â panthers in the wild as of 2008[update].[44] )Tj
T*( Perhaps the most dramatic loss of any group of animals has been to wading )Tj
T*(birds. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately )Tj
T*(2.5Â million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets \(Egretta thula\), )Tj
T*(roseate spoonbills \(Platalea ajaja\), and reddish egrets \(Egretta rufescens\) )Tj
T*(were hunted to the brink of extinction for the colorful feathers used in )Tj
T*(women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned )Tj
T*(in the 1930s, but over the next 50Â years actions by the C&amp;SF further )Tj
T*(disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was )Tj
T*(restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one )Tj
T*(wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to )Tj
T*(repopulate when water was withheld by the C&amp;SF. Birds were forced to fly )Tj
T*(farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had )Tj
T*(decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be )Tj
T*(closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain )Tj
T*(significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.[46][47] )Tj
T*( [edit] Invasive species )Tj
T*( Around 6Â million people moved to South Florida between 1940 and 1965. With a )Tj
T*(thousand people moving to Miami each week, urban development quadrupled.[48] As )Tj
T*(the human population grew rapidly, the problem of exotic plant and animal )Tj
T*(species also grew. Many species of plants were brought in to South Florida from )Tj
T*(Asia, Central America, or Australia as decorative landscaping. Exotic animals )Tj
T*(imported by the pet trade have escaped or been released. Biological controls )Tj
T*(that keep invasive species smaller in size and fewer in number in their native )Tj
T*(lands often do not exist in the Everglades, and they compete with the embattled )Tj
T*(native species for food and space. Of imported plant species, melaleuca trees )Tj
T*(\(Melaleuca quinquenervia\) have caused the most problems. Melaleucas grow on )Tj
T*(average 100 feet \(30Â m\) in the Everglades, as opposed to 25 to 60 feet \(7.6 to )Tj
T*(18 m\) in their native Australia. They were brought to southern Florida as )Tj
T*(windbreaks and deliberately seeded in marsh areas because they absorb vast )Tj
T*(amounts of water. In a region that is regularly shaped by fire, melaleucas are )Tj
T*(fire-resistant and their seeds are more efficiently spread by fire. They are )Tj

T*(Sustainable South Florida", submitted to Lawton Chiles in 1995, identified the )Tj
T*(problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked )Tj
T*(that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and )Tj
T*(other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in )Tj
T*(tourism \(12,000Â jobs and $200Â million annually\) and income from compromised )Tj
T*(commercial fishing \(3,300Â jobs and $52Â million annually\).[61] The report noted )Tj
T*(that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to "a )Tj
T*(precipitous juncture" where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health )Tj
T*(hazards in polluted air and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe urban )Tj
T*(conditions hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the )Tj
T*(population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered )Tj
T*(vehicles had increased by 166%.[61] On the quality and availability of water, )Tj
T*(the report stated, "[The] frequent water shortagesÂ ... create the irony of a )Tj
T*(natural system dying of thirst in a subtropical environment with over 53 inches )Tj
T*(of rain per year".[61] )Tj
T*( Restoration of the Everglades, however, briefly became a bipartisan cause in )Tj
T*(national politics. A controversial penny-a-pound \(2 cent/kg\) tax on sugar was )Tj
T*(proposed to fund some of the necessary changes to be made to help decrease )Tj
T*(phosphorus and make other improvements to water. State voters were asked to )Tj
T*(support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15Â million to encourage the issue. )Tj
T*(Sugar lobbyists responded with $24Â million in advertising to discourage it and )Tj
T*(succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history.[62] How )Tj
T*(restoration might be funded became a political battleground and seemed to stall )Tj
T*(without resolution. However, in the 1996 election year, Republican senator Bob )Tj
T*(Dole proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200Â million to acquire )Tj
T*(land for the Everglades. Democratic Vice President Al Gore promised the federal )Tj
T*(government would purchase 100,000 acres \(400Â km2\) of land in the EAA to turn it )Tj
T*(over for restoration. Politicking reduced the number to 50,000 acres \(200Â km2\), )Tj
T*(but both Dole's and Gore's gestures were approved by Congress.[63] )Tj
T*( [edit] Central and South Florida Project Restudy )Tj
T*( As part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, Congress authorized an )Tj
T*(evaluation of the effectiveness of the Central and Southern Florida Flood )Tj
T*(Control Project. A report known as the "Restudy", written by the U.S. Army )Tj
T*(Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, was )Tj
T*(submitted to Congress in 1999. It cited indicators of harm to the system: a 50% )Tj
T*(reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing )Tj
T*(of water release, an 85 to 90% decrease in wading bird populations over the )Tj
T*(past 50Â years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of )Tj
T*(water including Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, St. Lucie estuary, )Tj
T*(Lake Worth Lagoon, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and the Everglades reflected )Tj
T*(drastic water level changes, hypersalinity, and dramatic changes in marine and )Tj
T*(freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality )Tj
T*(over the past 50Â years was caused by loss of wetlands that act as filters for )Tj
T*(polluted water.[64] It predicted that without intervention the entire South )Tj
T*(Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Canals took roughly 170 billion US gallons )Tj
T*(\(640Â Gl\) of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico daily, so there was )Tj
T*(no opportunity for water storage, yet flooding was still a problem.[65] Without )Tj
T*(changes to the current system, the Restudy predicted water restrictions would )Tj
T*(be necessary every other year, and annually in some locations. It also warned )Tj
T*(that revising some portions of the project without dedicating efforts to an )Tj
T*(overall comprehensive plan would be insufficient and probably detrimental.[66] )Tj
T*( After evaluating ten plans, the Restudy recommended a comprehensive strategy )Tj
T*(that would cost $7.8Â billion over 20Â years. The plan advised taking the )Tj
T*(following actions: )Tj
T*( Create surface water storage reservoirs to capture 1,500,000 acre feet \(1.9Â )Tj
T*(km3\) of water in several locations taking up 181,300 acres \(734Â km2\).[67])Tj
T*(Create water preserve areas between Miami-Dade and Palm Beach and the eastern )Tj
T*(Everglades to treat runoff water.[67])Tj
T*(Manage Lake Okeechobee as an ecological resource to avoid the drastic rise and )Tj
T*(fall of water levels in the lake that are harmful to aquatic plant and animal )Tj

T*(  The implementation of all of the advised actions, the report stated, would )Tj
T*("result in the recovery of healthy, sustainable ecosystems throughout south )Tj
T*(Florida".[70] The report admitted that it did not have all the answers, though )Tj
T*(no plan could.[71] However, it predicted that it would restore the "essential )Tj
T*(defining features of the pre-drainage wetlands over large portions of the )Tj
T*(remaining system", that populations of all animals would increase, and animal )Tj
T*(distribution patterns would return to their natural states.[71] Critics )Tj
T*(expressed concern over some unused technology; scientists were unsure if the )Tj
T*(quarries would hold as much water as was being suggested, and whether the water )Tj
T*(would harbor harmful bacteria from the quarries. Overtaxing the aquifers was )Tj
T*(another concernâ€”it was not a technique that had been previously attempted.[72] )Tj
T*( Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(It is important to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of the future will )Tj
T*(be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. )Tj
T*(While it certainly will be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will )Tj
T*(not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of )Tj
T*(the irreversible physical changes that have made \(sic\) to the ecosystem. It )Tj
T*(will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than )Tj
T*(the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, )Tj
T*(because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which )Tj
T*(defined the original Everglades, and which made it unique among the worldâ€™s )Tj
T*(wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness )Tj
T*(of the former Everglades.[73])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The report was the result of many cooperating agencies that often had )Tj
T*(conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park )Tj
T*(management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly )Tj
T*(enoughâ€”that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they )Tj
T*(threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more )Tj
T*(water to the park. However, the Miccosukee Indians have a reservation in )Tj
T*(between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to )Tj
T*(ensure their tribal lands and a $50Â million casino would not be flooded.[74] )Tj
T*(Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would )Tj
T*(take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a )Tj
T*(bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan \(CERP\) was )Tj
T*(authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law )Tj

T*(Stormwater Treatment Areas \(STA\) have been constructed to filter 2,500 short )Tj

T*(A plan named "Acceler8", to hasten the construction and funding of the project, )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Despite the bipartisan goodwill and declarations of the importance of the )Tj
T*(Everglades, the region still remains in danger. Political maneuvering continues )Tj
T*(to impede CERP: sugar lobbyists promoted a bill in the Florida legislature in )Tj
T*(2003 that increased the acceptable amount of phosphorus in Everglades waterways )Tj
T*(from 10Â ppb to 15Â ppb and extended the deadline for the mandated decrease by 20Â )Tj
T*(years.[77] A compromise of 2016 was eventually reached. Environmental )Tj
T*(organizations express concern that attempts to speed up some of the )Tj
T*(construction through Acceler8 are politically motivated; the six projects )Tj
T*(Acceler8 focuses on do not provide more water to natural areas in desperate )Tj
T*(need of it, but rather to projects in populated areas bordering the Everglades, )Tj
T*(suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an )Tj
T*(already overtaxed environment.[78] Though Congress promised half the funds for )Tj
T*(restoration, after the War in Iraq began and two of CERP's major supporters in )Tj
T*(Congress retired, the federal role in CERP was left unfulfilled. According to a )Tj
T*(story in The New York Times, state officials say the restoration is lost in a )Tj
T*(maze of "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis' ".[79] In 2007, )Tj
T*(the release of $2Â billion for Everglades restoration was approved by Congress, )Tj
T*(overriding President George W. Bush's veto of the entire Water Development )Tj
T*(Project the money was a part of. Bush's rare veto went against the wishes of )Tj
T*(Florida Republicans, including his brother, Governor Jeb Bush. A lack of )Tj

T*(Washington D.C. in February 2008 and inquire about the promised funds.[80] By )Tj
T*(June 2008, the federal government had spent only $400Â million of the $7.8Â )Tj

T*(relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water )Tj
T*(into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as )Tj
T*(a "duh moment", Crist said, "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're )Tj
T*(paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we just get rid of sugar?"[62] The )Tj
T*(largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six )Tj

T*( In September 2008 the National Research Council \(NRC\), a nonprofit agency )Tj

T*( Albertosaurus \(pron.: /Ã¦lËŒbÉœrtÉµËˆsÉ”rÉ™s/; meaning "Alberta lizard"\) is a genus )Tj
T*(of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in western North America during )Tj
T*(the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70Â million years ago. The type species, A. )Tj
T*(sarcophagus, was apparently restricted in range to the modern-day Canadian )Tj
T*(province of Alberta, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the )Tj
T*(content of the genus, with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second )Tj
T*(species. )Tj
T*( As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, )Tj
T*(two-fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may )Tj
T*(have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. Although )Tj
T*(relatively large for a theropod, Albertosaurus was much smaller than its more )Tj
T*(famous relative Tyrannosaurus, probably weighing less than 2Â metric tons. )Tj
T*( Since the first discovery in 1884, fossils of more than thirty individuals )Tj
T*(have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of )Tj
T*(Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The )Tj
T*(discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and )Tj
T*(allows studies of ontogeny and population biology which are impossible with )Tj
T*(lesser-known dinosaurs. )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Albertosaurus was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as Tarbosaurus )Tj
T*(and Tyrannosaurus. Typical adults of Albertosaurus measured up to 9Â metres \(30Â )Tj
T*(ft\) long,[1][2] while rare individuals of great age could grow to over 10Â )Tj
T*(metres \(33Â ft\) in length.[3] Several independent mass estimates, obtained by )Tj
T*(different methods, suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1.3Â )Tj
T*(tonnes \(1.4Â short tons\)[4] and 1.7Â tonnes \(1.9Â tons\).[5] )Tj
T*( All tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, shared a similar body appearance. )Tj
T*(Typically for a theropod, Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head )Tj
T*(and torso with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely )Tj
T*(small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were )Tj
T*(long and ended in a four-toed foot. The first digit, called the hallux, was )Tj
T*(short and only the other three contacted the ground, with the third \(middle\) )Tj
T*(digit longer than the rest.[2]Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking )Tj
T*(speeds of 14âˆ’21Â kilometres per hour \(8âˆ’13Â miles per hour\).[6] At least for the )Tj
T*(younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Skull and teeth )Tj
T*( The massive skull of Albertosaurus, perched on a short, S-shaped neck, was )Tj
T*(approximately 1Â metre \(3.3Â ft\) long in the largest adults.[8] Wide openings in )Tj
T*(the skull \(fenestrae\) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space )Tj
T*(for muscle attachment and sensory organs. Its long jaws contained, both sides )Tj
T*(combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer )Tj
T*(teeth, Gorgosaurus at least sixty-two. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and )Tj
T*(other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending )Tj
T*(on their position in the mouth. The premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper )Tj
T*(jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and )Tj
T*(D-shaped in cross section.[2] Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary \(cheek\) )Tj
T*(teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces )Tj
T*(exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less )Tj
T*(formidable however, the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3413 )Tj
T*(Newton.[9] Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly )Tj
T*(coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.[10] )Tj
T*( William Abler observed in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations are so thin )Tj
T*(as to functionally be a crack in the tooth.[11] However, at the base of this )Tj
T*(crack is a round void called an ampulla which would have functioned to )Tj
T*(distribute force over a larger surface area, hindering the ability of the )Tj
T*("crack" formed by the serration to propagate through the tooth.[11] An )Tj

T*(a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions.[11] Tooth wear patterns hint )Tj
T*(that complex head shaking behaviours may have been involved in tyrannosaur )Tj
T*(feeding.[11] When a tyrannosaur would have pulled back on a piece of meat, the )Tj
T*(force would tend to push the tip of tooth toward the front of the mouth and the )Tj
T*(anchored root would experience tension on the posterior side and compression )Tj
T*(from the front.[11] This would typically incline the tooth to crack formation )Tj
T*(on the posterior side of the tooth, but the ampullae at the base of the already )Tj
T*(crack-like serrations would tend to diffuse potential crack-forming forces.[11] )Tj

T*( [edit] Classification and systematics )Tj
T*( Albertosaurus is a member of the theropod family Tyrannosauridae, in the )Tj
T*(subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older )Tj
T*(Gorgosaurus libratus \(sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus; see below\).[12] )Tj
T*(These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed )Tj
T*(species may exist.[13]Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an )Tj
T*(albertosaurine in 2004,[2] but his more recent unpublished work locates it just )Tj
T*(outside Tyrannosauridae,[14] in agreement with other authors.[15] )Tj
T*( The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, including )Tj
T*(Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Compared with these robust )Tj
T*(tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately )Tj
T*(smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg \(tibia\) and feet \(metatarsals )Tj
T*(and phalanges\).[8][12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Discovery and naming )Tj
T*( [edit] Naming )Tj
T*( Albertosaurus was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in a one-page note at the )Tj
T*(end of his 1905 description of Tyrannosaurus rex.[16]:265 The name honours )Tj
T*(Alberta, the Canadian province established the same year, in which the first )Tj
T*(remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the Greek term )Tj
T*(ÏƒÎ±Ï…ÏÎ¿Ï‚/sauros \("lizard"\), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The type )Tj
T*(species is Albertosaurus sarcophagus; the specific name is derived from Ancient )Tj
T*(Greek ÏƒÎ±ÏÎºÎ¿Ï†Î¬Î³Î¿Ï‚ \(sarkophagos\) meaning "flesh-eating" and having the same )Tj
T*(etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name: a combination )Tj
T*(of the Greek words ÏƒÎ±ÏÎ¾/sarx \("flesh"\) and Ï†Î±Î³ÎµÎ¹Î½/phagein \("to eat"\).[16] More )Tj
T*(than thirty specimens of all ages are known to science.[3][13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early discoveries )Tj
T*( The type specimen is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an )Tj
T*(outcrop of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation alongside the Red Deer River, in )Tj
T*(Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition )Tj
T*(of the Geological Survey of Canada, led by the famous geologist Joseph Burr )Tj
T*(Tyrrell. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could )Tj
T*(only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrell's colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston )Tj
T*(found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a )Tj
T*(location nearby.[17] The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species )Tj
T*(Laelaps incrassatus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892,[18] although the name )Tj
T*(Laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to Dryptosaurus )Tj
T*(in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Cope refused to recognize the new name )Tj
T*(created by his archrival Marsh, however, Lawrence Lambe instead of Laelaps )Tj
T*(incrassatus used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus when he described the )Tj
T*(remains in detail in 1903 and 1904,[19][20] a combination first coined by )Tj
T*(Oliver Perry Hay in 1902.[21] Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that D. )Tj

T*(Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis, type )Tj
T*(species of Dryptosaurus, so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus )Tj
T*(sarcophagus for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great )Tj
T*(detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before.[16] Both specimens )Tj
T*(\(the holotype CMN 5600 and the paratype CMN 5601\) are stored in the Canadian )Tj
T*(Museum of Nature in Ottawa. By the early twenty-first century some concerns had )Tj
T*(arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, Albertosaurus might be a )Tj
T*(nomen dubium, a "dubious name" that could only be used for the type specimen )Tj
T*(itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in )Tj
T*(2010 Thomas Carr established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable )Tj
T*(later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy: the )Tj
T*(possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the )Tj
T*(palatine bone, proving that Albertosaurus was a valid taxon.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dry Island bonebed )Tj
T*( On August 11, 1910, American paleontologist Barnum Brown discovered the )Tj
T*(remains of a large group of Albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the Red )Tj
T*(Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time )Tj
T*(available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to )Tj
T*(collect remains from all of the individuals they could identify in the bonebed. )Tj
T*(Among the bones deposited in the American Museum of Natural History collections )Tj
T*(in New York City are seven sets of right metatarsals, along with two isolated )Tj
T*(toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the )Tj
T*(presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. The Royal Tyrrell Museum )Tj
T*(of Palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the )Tj
T*(site, which is now located inside Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park.[7] )Tj
T*(Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of thirteen more )Tj
T*(individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old )Tj
T*(individual estimated at over 10Â metres \(33Â ft\) in length. None of these )Tj
T*(individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by )Tj
T*(remains in both museums.[3][4] Excavations continued until 2008, when the )Tj
T*(minimum number of individuals present had been established at twelve, on the )Tj
T*(basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at )Tj
T*(twenty-six if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to )Tj
T*(ontogeny. A total of 1128 Albertosaurus bones had been secured, the largest )Tj
T*(concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Gorgosaurus libratus )Tj
T*( In 1913, paleontologist Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid )Tj
T*(skeleton from the slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. Lawrence )Tj
T*(Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914.[24] Other specimens )Tj
T*(were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana. Finding, largely due )Tj
T*(to a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to )Tj
T*(separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior )Tj
T*(synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was )Tj
T*(renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970. A species distinction was maintained )Tj
T*(because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the )Tj
T*(genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range )Tj
T*(southwards by hundreds of kilometres.[1] )Tj
T*( In 2003, Philip J. Currie, benefiting from much more extensive finds and a )Tj
T*(general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several )Tj
T*(tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more )Tj
T*(distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is )Tj
T*(rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to )Tj
T*(each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless )Tj
T*(recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, )Tj
T*(as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and )Tj
T*(Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several )Tj
T*(albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and )Tj
T*(Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified )Tj
T*(once these are described fully.[13] Most authors have followed Currie's )Tj
T*(recommendation,[2][4][25] but some have not.[15] )Tj

T*( [edit] Growth pattern )Tj
T*( Most age categories of Albertosaurus are represented in the fossil record. )Tj
T*(Using bone histology, the age of an individual animal at the time of death can )Tj
T*(often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with )Tj
T*(other species. The youngest known Albertosaurus is a two-year-old discovered in )Tj
T*(the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50Â kilograms \(110Â lb\) )Tj
T*(and measured slightly more than 2Â metres \(7Â ft\) in length. The 10Â metre \(33Â ft\) )Tj
T*(specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of )Tj
T*(age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an )Tj
T*(S-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a )Tj
T*(four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen )Tj
T*(in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was 122Â kilograms )Tj

T*(have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the )Tj

T*(Albertosaurus had similar growth rates, although the much larger Tyrannosaurus )Tj
T*(rex grew almost five times faster \(601Â kilograms [1325Â lb] per year\) at its )Tj
T*(peak.[3] The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual )Tj
T*(maturity in Albertosaurus, although growth continued at a slower rate )Tj
T*(throughout the animals' lives.[3][4] Sexual maturation while still actively )Tj
T*(growing appears to be a shared trait among small[35] and large[36] dinosaurs as )Tj
T*(well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants.[36] This pattern of )Tj
T*(relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in )Tj
T*(birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished )Tj
T*(growing.[25][36] )Tj
T*( During growth, through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that, )Tj
T*(had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not )Tj
T*(proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would likely )Tj
T*(have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different )Tj
T*(species.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Life history )Tj
T*( Most known Albertosaurus individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of )Tj
T*(death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly )Tj
T*(preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely )Tj
T*(to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and )Tj
T*(collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by )Tj
T*(collectors in the field.[38] Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for )Tj
T*(juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record )Tj
T*(compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a )Tj
T*(consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile )Tj
T*(Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults )Tj
T*(did.[3] )Tj
T*( A hypothesis of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in )Tj
T*(large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their )Tj
T*(small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were )Tj
T*(larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, )Tj
T*(and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a )Tj
T*(dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil )Tj
T*(remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the )Tj
T*(physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with )Tj
T*(the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This )Tj
T*(elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high )Tj
T*(physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received )Tj
T*(during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the )Tj
T*(ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may )Tj
T*(explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because )Tj
T*(few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant )Tj
T*(mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden )Tj
T*(increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching )Tj
T*(maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including )Tj
T*(elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in )Tj
T*(other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other )Tj
T*(tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the )Tj
T*(fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than )Tj
T*(two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one )Tj
T*(locality.[3][25][39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Pack behaviour )Tj
T*( The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the )Tj

T*(phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 )Tj
T*(and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.[3] )Tj
T*( The near-absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation )Tj
T*(common to the many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie )Tj
T*(to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits )Tj
T*(in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. )Tj
T*(Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour.[7] Other scientists are )Tj
T*(skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, )Tj
T*(flood or for other reasons.[3][38][41] )Tj
T*( There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous )Tj
T*(dinosaurs, including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs.[42] However, only rarely are )Tj
T*(so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site. Small theropods like )Tj
T*(Deinonychus,[43]Coelophysis and Megapnosaurus \(Syntarsus rhodesiensis\)[44] have )Tj
T*(been found in aggregations, as have larger predators like Allosaurus and )Tj
T*(Mapusaurus.[45] There is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other )Tj
T*(tyrannosaurids as well. Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found )Tj
T*(alongside "Sue," the Tyrannosaurus mounted in the Field Museum of Natural )Tj
T*(History in Chicago, and a bonebed in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana )Tj
T*(contains at least three specimens of Daspletosaurus, preserved alongside )Tj
T*(several hadrosaurs.[46] These findings may corroborate the evidence for social )Tj
T*(behaviour in Albertosaurus, although some or all of the above localities may )Tj
T*(represent temporary or unnatural aggregations.[7] Others have speculated that )Tj
T*(instead of social groups, at least some of these finds represent Komodo )Tj
T*(dragon-like mobbing of carcasses, where aggressive competition leads to some of )Tj
T*(the predators being killed and cannibalized.[38] )Tj
T*( Currie also offers speculation on the pack-hunting habits of Albertosaurus. )Tj
T*(The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of )Tj
T*(ornithomimids, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger )Tj
T*(Albertosaurus were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their )Tj
T*(prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been )Tj
T*(responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more )Tj
T*(powerful, but also slower.[7] Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles )Tj
T*(than adults, filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the )Tj
T*(smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of )Tj
T*(magnitude smaller than adult Albertosaurus in mass.[2] A similar situation is )Tj
T*(observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small )Tj
T*(insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their )Tj
T*(islands.[47] However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is )Tj
T*(exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though )Tj
T*(still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration )Tj
T*(could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water )Tj
T*(level during an extended flood.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Paleopathology )Tj
T*( In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil )Tj
T*(jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite )Tj
T*(similar to Trichomonas gallinae which infects birds.[49] They suggested that )Tj
T*(tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the )Tj
T*(infection impaired their ability to eat food.[49] )Tj
T*( In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for )Tj
T*(stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the )Tj
T*(implications for their behavior. They found that only one of the 319 )Tj
T*(Albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and )Tj
T*(none of the four hand bones did. The scientists found that stress fractures )Tj

T*(Allosaurus.[50] ROM 807, the holotype of A. arctunguis \(now referred to A. )Tj

T*(70 to 68 Ma \(million years ago\). Immediately below this formation is the )Tj
T*(Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing a section of the Western )Tj
T*(Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels )Tj
T*(subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously )Tj
T*(been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would )Tj
T*(periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon )Tj
T*(times before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the )Tj
T*(changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the )Tj
T*(Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats )Tj
T*(and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal )Tj
T*(seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils )Tj
T*(from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in )Tj
T*(the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe )Tj
T*(Canyon times.[53] )Tj
T*( The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate )Tj
T*(fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. Sharks, rays, )Tj

T*(Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. )Tj
T*(Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all )Tj

T*(programme's companion record, entitled Arthur \(Or the Decline and Fall of the )Tj
T*(British Empire\). Development of Arthur occurred during a rough period for the )Tj
T*(band, due to the commercial failure of their previous album The Kinks Are the )Tj
T*(Village Green Preservation Society and the subsequent single, "Plastic Man", as )Tj
T*(well as the departure of founding member and bassist Pete Quaife.[8] In early )Tj
T*(1969, Quaife had told the band he was quitting,[9] though the other members did )Tj
T*(not take the remark seriously. When an article in the New Musical Express )Tj
T*(mentioned Maple Oak, the band that he had formed without the rest of The Kinks' )Tj
T*(knowledge,[9][10] Davies unsuccessfully asked Quaife to return for the upcoming )Tj
T*(sessions of Arthur.[11] As a replacement, Davies called up bassist John Dalton, )Tj
T*(who had previously filled in for Quaife.[11][12] )Tj
T*( Davies travelled to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 )Tj
T*(April 1969, to produce American pop band The Turtles' LP Turtle Soup with )Tj
T*(engineer Chuck Britz.[13] While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate an end )Tj
T*(to the concert ban placed on The Kinks by the American Federation of Musicians )Tj
T*(in 1965.[13] Although neither The Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason )Tj
T*(for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage )Tj
T*(behaviour.[14] After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening )Tj
T*(up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main )Tj
T*(sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While )Tj
T*(Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and )Tj
T*(practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo )Tj
T*(album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of.[7][13] When Ray returned, The Kinks )Tj
T*(regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, to rehearse the upcoming )Tj
T*(album Arthur.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recording )Tj
T*( The group turned to the recording proper on 1 May 1969.[13] The first tracks )Tj
T*(worked on were "Drivin'", intended as their next single release, and "Mindless )Tj
T*(Child Of Motherhood", written by Dave Davies \(the latter would eventually be )Tj
T*(used as the B-side to "Drivin'", and was not included on the LP\). The Kinks )Tj
T*(began a two-week series of focused sessions on 5 May, laying down an early )Tj
T*(version of the entire Arthur album. Recording was interrupted when The Kinks )Tj
T*(travelled to Beirut, Lebanon on 17 May to play three dates at the Melkart )Tj
T*(Hotel;[15] sessions for Arthur resumed the day after their return, and most of )Tj
T*(the recording for the album was finished by the end of the month.[15] Mixing )Tj
T*(and dubbing began in early June, with arranger Lew Warburton handling string )Tj
T*(overdubs.[16] The Kinks played a few small gigs in England throughout the )Tj
T*(remainder of the month, but devoted most of their time to finishing Dave )Tj
T*(Davies' solo album.[16] )Tj
T*( Writing for the TV play progressed through May and June, and on 15 June mixing )Tj
T*(for Dave Davies' solo LP was completed \(tapes for this record were eventually )Tj
T*(delivered to Pye and Reprise Records, although it never saw official )Tj
T*(release\).[15] A press release announced that the Arthur LP was scheduled for a )Tj
T*(late July release.[15] As Davies and Mitchell completed their script, the )Tj
T*(Arthur TV play began to crystallise, and British filmmaker Leslie Woodhead was )Tj
T*(assigned the role of director. By early September production was scheduled to )Tj
T*(begin, with a planned broadcast of late September, but these plans were )Tj
T*(continually delayed.[17] As problems with the TV play got progressively )Tj
T*(worseâ€”and, consequently, distracted The Kinks from completing the )Tj
T*(post-production of the albumâ€”the release dates for both projects were pushed )Tj
T*(further and further back.[7][15] In early October Ray Davies moved from )Tj
T*(Borehamwood back to his old family home on Fortis Green Road, in Muswell Hill, )Tj
T*(and travelled to Los Angeles, where he deposited the tapes at Reprise for )Tj
T*(Arthur's American release.[18] The album's release date was finally set for 10 )Tj
T*(October,[18] and The Kinks began gearing up for an upcoming US tour to support )Tj
T*(the album, for which they would depart on 17 October.[19] Shooting for the TV )Tj
T*(play was eventually set for 1 December. Roy Stonehouse was hired as a designer, )Tj
T*(and the casting was completed; however, the show was cancelled at the last )Tj
T*(minute when the producer was unable to secure financial backing.[20] Davies and )Tj
T*(Mitchell were frustrated at an entire year's work wastedâ€”Doug Hinman stated )Tj

T*( [edit] Release )Tj
T*( Arthur \(Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire\) was released in the US )Tj
T*(and UK on 10 October 1969, in both mono and stereo versions.[2] The album set )Tj
T*(the stage for The Kinks' return to touring the United States in late 1969,[14] )Tj
T*(and paved the way for even greater commercial success with the hit song "Lola" )Tj
T*(in 1970.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Singles and chart performance )Tj
T*( While the sessions for Arthur \(Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire\) )Tj
T*(were nearing completion in June 1969, the track "Drivin'" was released as a )Tj
T*(single in the UK, backed with "Mindless Child of Motherhood". For the first )Tj
T*(time since their breakthrough in 1964, a Kinks single failed to make an )Tj
T*(impression on the UK charts[23]â€”Johnny Rogan notes that "This was the first of )Tj
T*(two pilot singles for ... Arthur and its failure did not augur well."[24] The )Tj
T*(group followed with another single in September, "Shangri-La", which again )Tj
T*(failed to chart in the UK. As with Village Green, the album itself failed to )Tj
T*(chart when released in October.[23] )Tj
T*( In the US, "Victoria" was chosen as the lead single, backed with the album )Tj
T*(track "Brainwashed", and was released the same week as the LP. The single )Tj
T*(proved to be relatively successful, and reached number 62 on the Billboard Hot )Tj
T*(100â€”their highest position since their Top 20 hit "Sunny Afternoon" in 1966. )Tj
T*(The success of the single led to its release in the UK; backed with "Mr. )Tj
T*(Churchill Says", it reached a peak of number 30.[25]Arthur itself was a )Tj
T*(moderate commercial success in the US, where it peaked at number 105 \(the )Tj
T*(highest for a Kinks album since 1965\)[25] and remained on the charts for 20 )Tj
T*(weeks.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Promotion )Tj
T*( Reprise Records, The Kinks' US label, devised an elaborate, multi-levelled )Tj
T*(promotional campaign for Arthur in early 1969. The most famous branch of the )Tj
T*(programme involved a promo package entitled God Save The Kinks. The set )Tj
T*(featured various items, including a consumer's guide to the band's albums, a )Tj
T*(bag of "grass" from the "Daviesland village green", and an LP entitled Then, )Tj
T*(Now and Inbetween.[19] The set was accompanied by a positive letter from Hal )Tj
T*(Halverstadt of creative services at Warner/Reprise, part of which read, "... )Tj
T*([We are led] to believe that The Kinks may not have had it at all ... The Kinks )Tj
T*(are to be supported, encouraged, cheered. And saved."[19] The campaign was )Tj
T*(officially launched on 3 July, at a meeting between Ray Davies and Reprise )Tj
T*(executives in Burbank, California.[26] Reprise considered seeding false stories )Tj
T*(in the press to create an "outlaw" image for the group as part of the campaign, )Tj
T*(including pieces about marijuana possession and income tax evasion.[27] Ray )Tj
T*(called the idea "mad", and the programme was dropped. Several pieces, however, )Tj
T*(were used in the press kit for Arthur's release, with titles like "English Pop )Tj
T*(Group Arrested on Rape Rap".[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Packaging and liner notes )Tj
T*( Artwork for Arthur was created by Bob Lawrie.[28] The album was packaged in a )Tj
T*(gatefold sleeve, and included a shaped insert depicting Queen Victoria \(holding )Tj
T*(a house containing Arthur Morgan\), with lyrics on the reverse. Liner notes in )Tj
T*(the UK were written by Geoffrey Cannon and Julian Mitchell; in the US, notes by )Tj
T*(rock critic John Mendelsohn replaced Cannon's.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical response )Tj
T*( The album was critically acclaimed at the time of release, especially in the )Tj
T*(US rock press.[30] It was favourably compared to contemporary works, namely )Tj
T*(Tommy by The Who, released earlier in the year.[30] In Rolling Stone magazine, )Tj
T*(Arthur was spotlighted in its lead section, with back-to-back reviews by Mike )Tj
T*(Daly and Greil Marcus.[27] Daly called it "an album that is a masterpiece on )Tj
T*(every level: Ray Davies' finest hour, the Kinks' supreme achievement."[1] )Tj
T*(Marcus also praised the record, and said: "Less ambitious than Tommy, and far )Tj
T*(more musical ... Arthur is by all odds the best British album of 1969. It shows )Tj
T*(that Pete Townshend still has worlds to conquer and that The Beatles have a lot )Tj

T*(of catching up to do."[27] A review by Sal Imam ran in Boston's Fusion magazine )Tj
T*(read that "If Tommy was the greatest rock opera, then Arthur most surely is the )Tj
T*(greatest rock musical."[27][30] Writing in his Consumer Guide column of The )Tj
T*(Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the record a positive review, saying, )Tj
T*(although Ray Davies' lyrics could get "preachy at times", that the album )Tj
T*(featured "excellent music and production".[31] )Tj
T*( Reception in the UK was not as warm, although reviews were still generally )Tj
T*(positive.[30]Disc &amp; Music Echo commented that "Arthur works as a complete )Tj
T*(score because it is basic and simple and pleasing to the ear, and powerfully )Tj
T*(conjures up pictures in the eye."[2]Melody Maker seconded Mike Daly's comments )Tj
T*(in Rolling Stone, again calling it "Ray Davies' finest hour", and adding that )Tj
T*(it was "beautifully British to the core."[2] Doug Hinman would later comment on )Tj
T*(the album's reception in Britain: "In the British music press there [was] less )Tj
T*(celebration, and coverage [was] relatively routine, though everyone saw the )Tj
T*(rock opera angle."[30] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recent criticism )Tj
T*( Today the album receives generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine )Tj
T*(of Allmusic stated that Arthur was "one of the most effective concept albums in )Tj
T*(rock history, as well as one of the best and most influential British pop )Tj
T*(records of its era,"[32] and in 2003 Matt Golden of Stylus called it "the best )Tj
T*(rock opera ever".[22] Adrian Denning rated the album "[a] fine ... set of Kinks )Tj
T*(song[s]" with "absolutely no filler".[34]Georgiy Starostin gave Arthur a )Tj
T*(positive review and maximum 10 out of 10 as an overall rating.[36] Starostin )Tj
T*(appraised it as The Kinks' best record, and also pointed out that the melodies, )Tj
T*(though simple, were "unbelievingly catchy, funny and sincere, angry and raving )Tj
T*(at times, emotional and mystic at other times."[36]Switch magazine included )Tj
T*(Arthur on their "100 Best Albums of the 20th Century" in 1999, and in 2003 Mojo )Tj
T*(featured the album on their list of the "Top 50 Most Eccentric Albums".[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Story and theme )Tj
T*( The story is partially inspired by the Davies brothers' older sister Rose, who )Tj
T*(emigrated to Australia in 1964 with her husband Arthur Anning.[39] Her )Tj
T*(departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song "Rosie )Tj
T*(Won't You Please Come Home", included on the 1966 album Face to Face.[39] The )Tj
T*(lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morganâ€”modeled after Arthur )Tj
T*(Anningâ€”is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting )Tj
T*(of post-war England is depicted.[28][39] Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the )Tj
T*(story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the )Tj
T*(album's LP release: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("Arthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with )Tj
T*(a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married )Tj
T*(to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and )Tj
T*(Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another )Tj
T*(son, called Eddie. He was named for Arthur's brother, who was killed in the )Tj
T*(battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, tooâ€”in Korea."[28])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Davies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Arthur Anning )Tj
T*(later "told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... )Tj

T*( Wulfhere \(died 675\) was King of Mercia from 658 until 675 AD. He was the first )Tj
T*(Christian king of all of Mercia, though it is not known when or how he )Tj
T*(converted from Anglo-Saxon paganism. His accession marked the end of Oswiu of )Tj
T*(Northumbria's overlordship of southern England, and Wulfhere extended his )Tj
T*(influence over much of that region. His campaigns against the West Saxons led )Tj
T*(to Mercian control of much of the Thames valley. He conquered the Isle of Wight )Tj
T*(and the Meon valley and gave them to King Ã†thelwealh of the South Saxons. He )Tj
T*(also had influence in Surrey, Essex, and Kent. He married Eormenhild, the )Tj

T*( Wulfhere's father, Penda, was killed in 655 at the Battle of Winwaed, fighting )Tj
T*(against Oswiu of Northumbria. Penda's son Peada became king under Oswiu's )Tj

T*( By 670, when Oswiu died, Wulfhere was the most powerful king in southern )Tj

T*(674, he challenged Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria, but was defeated. He )Tj

T*( England in the early 7th century was ruled almost entirely by the Anglo-Saxon )Tj
T*(peoples who had come to Britain from northwestern Europe, starting in the early )Tj
T*(5th century. The monk Bede, who wrote in the 8th century, considered the )Tj
T*(Mercians to be descended from the Angles, one of the invading groups; the )Tj
T*(Saxons and Jutes settled in the south of Britain, while the Angles settled in )Tj
T*(the north.[2] Little is known about the origins of the kingdom of Mercia, in )Tj
T*(what is now the English midlands, but according to genealogies preserved in the )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Anglian collection the early kings were descended )Tj
T*(from Icel; the dynasty is therefore known as the Iclingas.[3] The earliest )Tj
T*(Mercian king about whom definite historical information has survived is Penda )Tj
T*(of Mercia, Wulfhere's father.[4] )Tj
T*( According to Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, a history of the )Tj
T*(English church, there were seven early Anglo-Saxon rulers who held imperium, or )Tj
T*(overlordship, over the other kingdoms.[5] The fifth of these was Edwin of )Tj
T*(Northumbria, who was killed at the battle of Hatfield Chase by a combined force )Tj
T*(including Cadwallon, a British king of Gwynedd, and Penda. At the time of this )Tj
T*(victory, Penda was probably not yet king of Mercia. His children included two )Tj
T*(future kings of Mercia: Wulfhere and Ã†thelred.[6] )Tj
T*( After Edwin's death, Northumbria briefly fell apart into its two constituent )Tj
T*(kingdoms. Within a year Oswald killed Cadwallon and reunited the kingdoms, and )Tj
T*(subsequently re-established Northumbrian hegemony over the south of England.[7] )Tj
T*(However, on 5 August 642, Penda killed Oswald at the battle of Maserfield, )Tj
T*(probably at Oswestry in the northwest midlands.[8] Penda is not recorded as )Tj
T*(overlord of the other southern Anglo-Saxon kings, but he became the most )Tj
T*(powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings after he defeated Oswald.[9] On Oswald's )Tj
T*(death, Northumbria was divided again: Oswald's son Oswiu succeeded to the )Tj
T*(throne of Bernicia, and Osric's son Oswine to Deira, the southern of the two )Tj
T*(kingdoms.[10] )Tj
T*( The main source for this period is Bede's History, completed in about 731. )Tj
T*(Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work also provides )Tj
T*(valuable information about the early pagan kingdoms. For other kingdoms than )Tj
T*(his native Northumbria, such as Wessex and Kent, Bede had an informant within )Tj
T*(the ecclesiastical establishment who supplied him with additional information. )Tj
T*(This does not seem to have been the case with Mercia, about which Bede is less )Tj
T*(informative than about other kingdoms.[11] Further sources for this period )Tj
T*(include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, compiled at the end of the 9th century in )Tj
T*(Wessex. The Chronicle's anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much )Tj
T*(information recorded in earlier periods.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ancestry )Tj
T*( Wulfhere was the son of Penda of Mercia. Penda's queen, Cynewise, is named by )Tj
T*(Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and )Tj
T*(so it is likely but not certain that she was Wulfhere's mother.[13][14] The )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives Penda's age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a )Tj
T*(thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty years old at the time of )Tj
T*(his death, which is generally thought unlikely as two of his sons \(Wulfhere and )Tj
T*(Ã†thelred\) are recorded as being young when he was killed. It is thought at )Tj
T*(least as likely that Penda was 50 years old at his death, rather than at his )Tj
T*(accession.[6][15] Wulfhere's date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes him )Tj
T*(as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he was in his )Tj
T*(middle teens at that time; Penda would then have been in his thirties at the )Tj
T*(time Wulfhere was born.[16] )Tj
T*( Nothing is known of Wulfhere's childhood. He had two brothers, Peada and )Tj
T*(Ã†thelred, and two sisters, Cyneburh and Cyneswith;[17][18] it is also possible )Tj
T*(that Merewalh, king of the MagonsÃ¦te, was Wulfhere's brother.[19] He married )Tj
T*(Eormenhild of Kent; no date is recorded for the marriage and there is no record )Tj
T*(of any children in the earliest sources, though Coenred, who was king of Mercia )Tj
T*(from 704 to 709, is recorded in John of Worcester's 12th century chronicle as )Tj
T*(Wulfhere's son.[20] Another possible child is Berhtwald, a subking who is )Tj
T*(recorded as a nephew of Ã†thelred,[21] and a third child, Werburh, is recorded )Tj
T*(in an 11th century manuscript as a daughter of Wulfhere.[22] An 11th-century )Tj

T*(history of St. Peter's Monastery in Gloucester names two other women, Eadburh )Tj
T*(and Eafe, as queens of Wulfhere, but neither claim is plausible.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Accession and overlordship )Tj
T*( In 655 Penda besieged Oswiu of Northumbria at Iudeu, the location of which is )Tj
T*(unknown but which may have been Stirling, in Scotland. Penda took Oswiu's son, )Tj
T*(Ecgfrith, as hostage, and Oswiu paid tribute, in the form of treasure, to )Tj
T*(secure Penda's departure. On the way back to Mercia, Oswiu overtook Penda and )Tj
T*(on 15 November 655 Oswiu and Penda fought on the banks of the \(unidentified\) )Tj
T*(river Winwaed.[25] Penda was killed and beheaded by Oswiu, who divided Mercia )Tj
T*(into northern and southern halves.[26] The northern portion was kept under )Tj
T*(direct Northumbrian control; the southern kingdom was given to Penda's son )Tj
T*(Peada, who had married Oswiu's daughter EalhflÃ¦d ca 653.[27] )Tj
T*( Peada did not remain king long. He was murdered at Easter in 656, perhaps with )Tj
T*(the connivance of his wife, Oswiu's daughter.[28] Oswiu then ruled all Mercia )Tj
T*(himself. Bede lists Oswiu as the seventh and last king to hold imperium \(or )Tj
T*(bretwalda in the language of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\) over the other )Tj
T*(Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.[5] Overlordship was a common relationship between )Tj
T*(kingdoms at this time, often taking the form of a lesser king under the )Tj
T*(domination of a stronger one. Oswiu went further than this, however, and )Tj
T*(installed his own governors in Mercia after the deaths of Penda and Peada. This )Tj
T*(attempt to establish close control of Mercia failed in 658 when three Mercian )Tj
T*(leaders, Immin, Eafa and Eadbert, rebelled against the Northumbrians. Bede )Tj
T*(reports that they had kept Wulfhere in hiding, and when the revolt succeeded )Tj
T*(Wulfhere became king.[29] It has been suggested that the Mercian revolt )Tj
T*(succeeded because Oswiu may have been occupied with fighting in Pictland, in )Tj
T*(northern Britain. His nephew the Pictish king Talorgan, son of Eanfrith, had )Tj
T*(died in 657.[30] )Tj
T*( How much direct control Oswiu exerted over the southern kingdoms during his )Tj
T*(imperium is unclear. Bede describes Oswiu's friendship and influence over )Tj
T*(Sigeberht of the East Saxons,[31] but generally the pattern in the southeast is )Tj
T*(of more local domination, with Oswiu's influence unlikely to have been )Tj
T*(particularly strong.[27] Wulfhere appears to have taken over Oswiu's position )Tj
T*(in many instances.[32] Bede does not list him as one of the rulers who )Tj
T*(exercised imperium, but modern historians consider that the rise to primacy of )Tj
T*(the kingdom of Mercia began in his reign. He seems to have been the effective )Tj
T*(overlord of Britain south of the Humber from the early 660s, though not )Tj
T*(overlord of Northumbria as his father had been.[33] )Tj
T*( A document called the Tribal Hidage may date from Wulfhere's reign. Drawn up )Tj
T*(before many smaller groups of peoples were absorbed into the larger kingdoms, )Tj
T*(such as Mercia, it records the peoples of Anglo-Saxon England, along with an )Tj
T*(assessment in hides, a unit of land. The Tribal Hidage is difficult to date )Tj
T*(precisely; it may have been written down in Wulfhere's reign, but other )Tj
T*(suggested origins include the reign of Offa of Mercia, or Edwin or Oswiu of )Tj
T*(Northumbria.[34][35] )Tj
T*( [edit] A convert king )Tj
T*( Britain had been Christianized under the Romans, but the incoming Anglo-Saxons )Tj
T*(practiced their indigenous religion \(Anglo-Saxon paganism\) and the church in )Tj
T*(Great Britain was limited to the surviving British kingdoms in Scotland and )Tj
T*(Wales, and the kingdom of Dumnonia in the southwest of England. Missionaries )Tj
T*(from Rome began converting the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity at the end of the )Tj
T*(6th century, and this process was well under way in Penda's reign, though Penda )Tj
T*(himself remained pagan throughout his life.[36] Records survive of the baptism )Tj
T*(of other kings at this timeâ€”Cynegils of Wessex was baptized in about 640,[37] )Tj
T*(for example, and Edwin of Northumbria was converted in the mid 620s.[38] )Tj
T*(However, later kings, such as CÃ¦dwalla of Wessex, who ruled in the 680s, are )Tj
T*(recorded as pagan at their accession.[39] )Tj
T*( Bede writes that after Wulfhere became king: "Free under their own king, they )Tj
T*([the Mercians] gave willing allegiance to Christ their true king, so that they )Tj
T*(might win his eternal kingdom in heaven".[14] While Wulfhere's father had )Tj

T*(to marry Oswiu's daughter, the date and the circumstances of Wulfhere's )Tj
T*(conversion are unknown. It has been suggested that he adopted Christianity as )Tj
T*(part of a settlement with Oswiu.[40] Bede records that two years before Penda's )Tj
T*(death, his son Peada converted to Christianity, influenced partly by Oswiu's )Tj
T*(son Ealhfrith, who had married Peada's sister Cyneburh. Peada brought a )Tj
T*(Christian mission into Mercia, and it is possible that this was when Wulfhere )Tj
T*(became a Christian.[41] Wulfhere's marriage to Eormenhild of Kent would have )Tj
T*(brought Mercia into close contact with the Christian kingdoms of Kent and )Tj
T*(Merovingian Gaul, which were connected by kinship and trade. The political and )Tj
T*(economic benefits of the marriage may therefore also have been a factor in )Tj
T*(Wulfhere's Christianization of his kingdom.[42][43] )Tj
T*( Wulfhere's relationship with Bishop Wilfrid is recorded in Stephen of Ripon's )Tj
T*(Life of Wilfrid. During the years 667â€“9, while Wilfrid was at Ripon, Wulfhere )Tj
T*(frequently invited him to come to Mercia when there was need of the services of )Tj
T*(a bishop. According to Stephen, Wulfhere rewarded Wilfrid with "many tracts of )Tj
T*(land", in which Wilfrid "soon established minsters for servants of God".[44] )Tj
T*( According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Wulfhere endowed a major monastery at )Tj
T*(Medeshamstede, in modern Peterborough. The monastery had initially been endowed )Tj
T*(by Peada; for the dedication of Wulfhere's gift both Archbishop Deusdedit \(died )Tj
T*(664\), and Bishop Jaruman \(held office from 663\), were present. The endowment )Tj
T*(was signed by Wulfhere and Oswiu, and by Sigehere and SÃ¦bbi, the Kings of )Tj
T*(Essex.[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] West Saxons, South Saxons and Hwicce )Tj
T*( In 661, Wulfhere is recorded in the Chronicle as harrying Ashdown, in West )Tj
T*(Saxon territory. The Gewisse, thought to be the original group from which the )Tj
T*(West Saxons came, appear to have originally settled in the upper Thames valley, )Tj
T*(and what records survive of the 6th century show them active in that region. )Tj
T*(The Mercian resurgence under Wulfhere placed them under severe pressure. Also )Tj
T*(in the early 660s, the West Saxon see of Dorchester, in the same area, was )Tj
T*(divided, and a new bishopric set up at Winchester. This decision was probably a )Tj
T*(reaction to the advance of the Mercians into the traditional heartland of the )Tj
T*(West Saxons, leaving Dorchester dangerously close to the border. Within a few )Tj
T*(years, the Dorchester see was abandoned;[46] the exact date is not known, but )Tj
T*(it was probably in the mid 660s.[47] )Tj
T*( In addition to the attack on Ashdown, Wulfhere raided the Isle of Wight in )Tj
T*(661. He subsequently gave both the island and the territory of the Meonware, )Tj
T*(which lay along the river Meon, on the mainland north of the Isle of Wight, to )Tj
T*(his godson King Ã†thelwealh of the South Saxons. It seems likely that the ruling )Tj
T*(dynasty on the island found these arrangements acceptable to some degree, since )Tj
T*(the West Saxons, under CÃ¦dwalla, exterminated the whole family when they )Tj
T*(launched their own attack on the island in 686.[48][49] After the conquest of )Tj
T*(the Isle of Wight, Wulfhere ordered the priest Eoppa to provide baptism to the )Tj
T*(inhabitants. According to the Chronicle, this was the first time Christian )Tj
T*(baptism had reached the island.[50] )Tj
T*( In the early 670s, Cenwealh of Wessex died, and perhaps as a result of the )Tj
T*(stress caused by Wulfhere's military activity the West Saxon kingdom fragmented )Tj
T*(and came to be ruled by underkings, according to Bede.[51] Eventually these )Tj
T*(underkings were defeated and the kingdom reunited, probably by CÃ¦dwalla but )Tj
T*(possibly by Centwine. A decade after Wulfhere's death, the West Saxons under )Tj
T*(CÃ¦dwalla began an aggressive expansion to the east, reversing much of the )Tj
T*(Mercian advance.[52] )Tj
T*( In addition to being Wulfhere's godson, King Ã†thelwealh of the South Saxons )Tj
T*(had a connection to the Mercians via marriage. His wife was Queen Eafe, the )Tj
T*(daughter of Eanfrith of the Hwicce, a tribe whose territory lay to the )Tj
T*(southwest of Mercia. The Hwicce had their own royal family, but it appears that )Tj
T*(at this date they were already subordinate to Wulfhere: the marriage between )Tj
T*(Ã†thelwealh and Eafe may well have taken place at Wulfhere's court, since it is )Tj
T*(known Ã†thelwealh was converted there.[53] The kingdom of the Hwicce is )Tj
T*(sometimes regarded as a creation of Penda's, but it is equally likely that the )Tj
T*(kingdom existed independently of Mercia, and that Penda and Wulfhere's )Tj

T*(increasing influence in the area represented an extension of Mercian power )Tj
T*(rather than the creation of a separate entity.[54][55] )Tj
T*( [edit] East Anglia and the East Saxons )Tj
T*( In 664, Ã†thelwald of East Anglia died, and was succeeded by Ealdwulf, who )Tj
T*(reigned for fifty years. Almost nothing is known of Mercian relations with East )Tj
T*(Anglia during this time; East Anglia had previously been dominated by )Tj
T*(Northumbria, but there is no evidence that this continued after Wulfhere's )Tj
T*(accession. Swithhelm of the East Saxons also died in 664; he was succeeded by )Tj
T*(his two sons, Sigehere and SÃ¦bbi, and Bede describes their accession as "rulersÂ )Tj
T*(... under Wulfhere, king of the Mercians".[42] A plague the same year caused )Tj
T*(Sigehere and his people to recant their Christianity, and according to Bede, )Tj
T*(Wulfhere sent Jaruman, the bishop of Lichfield, to reconvert the East Saxons. )Tj
T*(Jaruman was not the first bishop of Lichfield; Bede mentions a predecessor, )Tj
T*(Trumhere, but nothing is known about Trumhere's activities or who appointed )Tj
T*(him.[56] )Tj
T*( It is apparent from these events that Oswiu's influence in the south had waned )Tj
T*(by this time, if not before, and that Wulfhere now dominated the area. This )Tj
T*(becomes even clearer in the next few years, as some time between 665 and 668 )Tj
T*(Wulfhere sold the see of London to Wine, who had been expelled from his West )Tj
T*(Saxon bishopric by Cenwealh. London fell within the East Saxons' territory in )Tj
T*(that period.[32] From the archaeological evidence, it appears to be about this )Tj
T*(time that the Middle Saxon settlement in London began to expand significantly; )Tj
T*(the centre of Anglo-Saxon London was not at the old Roman centre, but about a )Tj
T*(mile west of that, near what is now the location of the Strand. Wulfhere may )Tj
T*(have been in control of the city when this expansion began.[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] Kent, Surrey and Lindsey )Tj
T*( Eorcenberht was the king of Kent at Wulfhere's accession, and the two families )Tj
T*(became connected when Wulfhere married Eorcenberht's daughter Eormenhild.[58] )Tj
T*(In 664 Eorcenberht's son Egbert succeeded to the Kentish throne. The situation )Tj
T*(in Kent at Egbert's death in 673 is not clearly recorded. It appears that a )Tj
T*(year passed before Hlothhere, Egbert's brother, became king. Wulfhere may have )Tj
T*(had an interest in the succession, as through his marriage to Eormenhild he was )Tj
T*(the uncle of Egbert's two sons, Eadric and Wihtred. It has been speculated that )Tj
T*(Wulfhere acted as the effective ruler of Kent in the interregnum between )Tj
T*(Egbert's death and Hlothhere's accession.[49] Another Mercian connection to )Tj
T*(Kent was through Merewalh, the king of the MagonsÃ¦te, and hence a subking under )Tj
T*(Wulfhere. Merewalh, who may have been Wulfhere's brother, was married to )Tj
T*(Hlothhere's sister, Eormenburh.[19] )Tj
T*( Surrey is not recorded as ever having been an independent kingdom, but was at )Tj
T*(least a province that was under the control of different neighbours at )Tj
T*(different times. It was ruled by Egbert until the early 670s, when a charter )Tj
T*(shows Wulfhere confirming a grant made to Bishop Eorcenwald by Frithuwold, a )Tj
T*(sub-king in Surrey, which may have extended north into modern )Tj
T*(Buckinghamshire.[59][60] Frithuwold himself was probably married to Wilburh, )Tj
T*(Wulfhere's sister.[59] The charter, made from Thame, is dated between 673 and )Tj
T*(675, and it was probably Egbert's death that triggered Wulfhere's intervention. )Tj
T*(A witness named Frithuric is recorded on a charter in the reign of Wulfhere's )Tj
T*(successor, Ã†thelred, making a grant to the monastery of Peterborough, and the )Tj
T*(alliteration common in Anglo-Saxon dynasties has led to speculation that the )Tj
T*(two men may have both come from a Middle Anglian dynasty, with Wulfhere perhaps )Tj
T*(having placed Frithuwold on the throne of Surrey. The charter is witnessed by )Tj
T*(three other subkings, named Osric, Wigheard, and Ã†thelwold; their kingdoms are )Tj
T*(not identified but the charter mentions Sonning, a province in what is now )Tj
T*(eastern Berkshire, and it may be that one of these subkings was a ruler of the )Tj
T*(Sunningas, the people of that province. This would in turn imply Wulfhere's )Tj
T*(domination of that province by that time.[49] )Tj
T*( Wulfhere's influence among the Lindesfara, whose territory, Lindsey, lay in )Tj
T*(what is now Lincolnshire, is known from information about episcopal authority. )Tj
T*(At least one of the Mercian bishops of Lichfield is known to have exercised )Tj
T*(authority there: Wynfrith, who became bishop on Chad's death in 672.[42][59] In )Tj

T*(addition it is known that Wulfhere gave land at Barrow upon Humber, in Lindsey, )Tj
T*(to Chad, for a monastery.[61] It is possible that Chad also had authority there )Tj
T*(as bishop, probably no later than 669.[42] It may be that the political basis )Tj
T*(for Mercian episcopal control of the Lindesfara was laid early in Wulfhere's )Tj
T*(reign, under Trumhere and Jaruman, the two bishops who preceded Chad.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Defeat and death )Tj
T*( When Wulfhere attacked Oswiu's son Ecgfrith in 674, he did so from a position )Tj
T*(of strength. Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid says that Wulfhere "stirred up )Tj
T*(all the southern nations against [Northumbria]". Bede does not report the )Tj
T*(fighting, nor is it mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but according to )Tj
T*(Stephen, Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere, forcing him to surrender Lindsey, and to )Tj
T*(pay tribute.[62] )Tj
T*( Wulfhere survived the defeat but evidently lost some degree of control over )Tj
T*(the south as a result; in 675, Ã†scwine, one of the kings of the West Saxons, )Tj
T*(fought him at Biedanheafde. It is not known where this battle was, or who was )Tj
T*(the victor. Henry of Huntingdon, a 12th-century historian who had access to )Tj
T*(versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle now lost,[63] believed that Mercians had )Tj
T*(been the victors in a "terrible battle" and remarks upon Wulfhere having )Tj
T*(inherited "the valour of his father and grandfather".[64] Kirby, however, )Tj
T*(presumes Ã†scwine was sufficiently successful to break Wulfhere's hold over )Tj
T*(Wessex.[65] )Tj
T*( Wulfhere died later in 675. The cause of death, according to Henry of )Tj
T*(Huntingdon, was disease.[64] He would have been in his mid-thirties. His widow, )Tj
T*(Eormenhild, is thought to have later become the abbess of Ely.[66] Ã†thelred, )Tj
T*(Wulfhere's brother, succeeded to the throne and reigned for nearly thirty )Tj
T*(years. Ã†thelred recovered Lindsey from the Northumbrians a few years after his )Tj
T*(accession, but he was generally unable to maintain the domination of the south )Tj
T*(achieved by Wulfhere.[65] )Tj

T*(Connecticut \(as part of its Western Reserve\), and Massachusetts. It officially )Tj
T*(became part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts )Tj
T*(and New York relinquished their claims to the federal government, which in turn )Tj
T*(sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75Â cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 )Tj
T*(in Continental currency. The Iroquois released the land to Pennsylvania in )Tj
T*(January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the )Tj
T*(federal government. The Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against )Tj
T*(Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.[5] )Tj
T*( The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near )Tj
T*(Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who )Tj
T*(completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C. and helped )Tj
T*(resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the )Tj
T*(survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. Initial settlement of )Tj
T*(the area began that year.[5][6] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to )Tj
T*(the Erie area from Geneva, New York, and before that from Uxbridge, )Tj
T*(Massachusetts, and became the first European settlers of Erie, settling at what )Tj

T*( Erie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub in the mid-19th )Tj
T*(century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the )Tj
T*(delays required to unload and load passengers and cargo were a problem for )Tj
T*(commerce and travel, they provided much needed local jobs in Erie. When a )Tj
T*(national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the )Tj
T*(rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, )Tj
T*(set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to attempt to stop the )Tj
T*(standardization in an event known as the Erie Gauge War.[8] )Tj
T*( On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie when a culvert, )Tj
T*(blocked by debris, gave out.[9] A four block reservoir, caused by torrential )Tj
T*(downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225Â houses and )Tj
T*(killed 36Â people.[9] After the flood, Mayor Miles B. Kitts had the Mill Creek )Tj
T*(diverted to a 22 by 19 feet \(6.7Â m Ã—Â 5.8Â m\), concrete tube that travels for )Tj
T*(over 2 miles \(3.2Â km\) under the city, before emptying into to Presque Isle Bay )Tj

T*( Erie's importance gradually faded during the second half of 20th Century as )Tj

T*(drew to a close.[10] Downtown Erie continued to grow for most of the 20th )Tj
T*(century, before taking a major population downturn in the 1970s.[10] With the )Tj

T*(percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the East Coast, )Tj
T*(including the Florida peninsula, and a 40Â percent chance of at least one such )Tj
T*(strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward. The potential for )Tj
T*(major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast to be above average, and )Tj
T*(the team predicted that El NiÃ±o, associated with reduced hurricane activity in )Tj
T*(the Atlantic, would dissipate by the active portion of the season.[1] )Tj
T*( On AprilÂ 3 a new forecast was issued, calling for a very active hurricane )Tj
T*(season of 17Â named storms, nineÂ hurricanes and fiveÂ intense hurricanes.[3] The )Tj
T*(increase in the forecast was attributed to the rapid dissipation of El NiÃ±o )Tj
T*(conditions. The team also forecast a neutral or weak-to-moderate La NiÃ±a and )Tj
T*(noted that sea surface temperatures were much higher than average.[4] The )Tj
T*(estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was )Tj
T*(increased to 74Â percent; the East Coast potential increased to 50Â percent, and )Tj
T*(from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability rose )Tj

T*(and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced )Tj
T*(upon Haleâ€“Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 )Tj
T*(and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius.[6] )Tj
T*(Hale first established that there was no other deep-sky object near M70, and )Tj
T*(then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be )Tj
T*(in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving )Tj
T*(relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for )Tj
T*(Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.[7] )Tj
T*( Bopp did not own a telescope. He was out with friends near Stanfield, Arizona )Tj
T*(observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at )Tj
T*(the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted )Tj
T*(something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any )Tj
T*(other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were )Tj
T*(none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a )Tj
T*(Western Union telegram. Brian Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, )Tj
T*(laughed, "Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got )Tj
T*(here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated )Tj
T*(coordinates."[8] )Tj
T*( The following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was )Tj
T*(given the designation C/1995Â O1. The discovery was announced in International )Tj
T*(Astronomical Union circular 6187.[6][9] )Tj
T*( The comet may have been observed by ancient Egyptians during the reign of )Tj
T*(pharaoh Pepi I \(2332â€“2283 BC\). In Pepi's pyramid in Saqqara is a text referring )Tj
T*(to an "nhh-star" as a companion of the pharaoh in the heavens, where "nhh" is )Tj
T*(the hieroglyph for long hair.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early observation )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2Â astronomical units \(AU\) )Tj
T*(from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and by far the greatest )Tj
T*(distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs.[11][12] )Tj
T*(Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible )Tj
T*(activity, but Haleâ€“Bopp already had an observable coma.[6] An image taken at )Tj
T*(the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed )Tj
T*(comet some 13Â AU from the Sun,[13] a distance at which most comets are )Tj
T*(essentially unobservable. \(Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at )Tj
T*(the same distance from the Sun.\)[14] Analysis indicated later that its comet )Tj
T*(nucleus was 60Â±20Â kilometres in diameter, approximately six times the size of )Tj
T*(Halley.[1][15] )Tj
T*( Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that comet Haleâ€“Bopp )Tj
T*(might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, )Tj
T*(comet scientists were wary â€“ comets can be extremely unpredictable, and many )Tj
T*(have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later. )Tj
T*(Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and turned )Tj
T*(out to be unspectacular.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Perihelion )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp became visible to the naked eye in May 1996, and although its rate )Tj
T*(of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year,[16] )Tj
T*(scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. )Tj
T*(It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, )Tj
T*(but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen )Tj
T*(by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted )Tj
T*(skies.[17] )Tj
T*( The Internet was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that )Tj
T*(tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world )Tj
T*(became extremely popular. The Internet played a large role in encouraging the )Tj
T*(unprecedented public interest in comet Haleâ€“Bopp.[18] )Tj
T*( As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2ndÂ )Tj
T*(magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail )Tj
T*(pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away )Tj
T*(along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern )Tj
T*(Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.[19] Haleâ€“Bopp )Tj

T*(AU.[20] )Tj
T*( As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into a )Tj
T*(spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, )Tj
T*(and its dust tail stretched 40â€“45 degrees across the sky.[21][22] The comet was )Tj
T*(visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great )Tj
T*(comets are very close to the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Haleâ€“Bopp was )Tj
T*(visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] After perihelion )Tj
T*( After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial )Tj
T*(hemisphere, and its show was over as far as most of the northern hemisphere was )Tj
T*(concerned. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers )Tj
T*(than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see )Tj
T*(the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last )Tj
T*(naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the )Tj
T*(comet had remained visible without aid for 569Â days, or about 18 and a half )Tj
T*(months.[16] The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which )Tj
T*(was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.[16] )Tj
T*( The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by )Tj
T*(astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of )Tj
T*(25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of )Tj

T*(2012 Aug 7 when it was 33.2AU from the Sun.[27] Astronomers expect that the )Tj
T*(comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which )Tj
T*(time it will be nearing 30thÂ magnitude.[28] By this time it will become very )Tj
T*(difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies )Tj
T*(of similar brightness. )Tj
T*( [edit] Orbital changes )Tj
T*( The comet likely made its last perihelion 4,200 years ago.[29] Its orbit is )Tj
T*(almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, which ensures that close )Tj
T*(approaches to planets are rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within )Tj
T*(0.77Â AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be affected by the planet's )Tj
T*(gravity.[29] The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of )Tj
T*(roughly 2,533Â years,[1] and it will next return to the inner Solar System )Tj
T*(around the year 4385.[4] Its greatest distance from the Sun \(aphelion\) will be )Tj
T*(about 370Â AU,[1] reduced from about 525Â AU.[30][31] )Tj
T*( Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on )Tj
T*(comets with high orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is )Tj
T*(generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Haleâ€“Bopp has )Tj
T*(about a 15%Â chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this )Tj
T*(process.[32] )Tj
T*( It has been calculated that the previous visit by Haleâ€“Bopp occurred in July )Tj
T*(2215Â BC.[30] The comet may have presented a similar sight to people then, as )Tj
T*(the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4Â AU, but no records of it have )Tj
T*(survived. Haleâ€“Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June )Tj
T*(2215Â BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215Â BC may )Tj
T*(have been its first passage through the inner Solar System.[30] )Tj
T*( The estimated probability of impacting Earth in future passages through the )Tj
T*(inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5 x 10âˆ’9 per orbit.[33] However, given )Tj
T*(that the comet nucleus is around 60Â km in diameter,[1] the consequences of such )Tj
T*(an impact would be apocalyptic. A calculation given by Weissman[33] )Tj
T*(conservatively estimates the diameter at 35Â km; an estimated density of 0.6 )Tj
T*(g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3 x 1019 g. An impact velocity of 52.5Â )Tj
T*(km/s yields an impact energy of 1.9 x 1032ergs, or 4.4 x 109megatons, about 44 )Tj
T*(times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event. )Tj

T*(observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high \(up to )Tj
T*(2.0Ã—106 kg/s\),[34] which may have made the inner coma optically thick.[35] )Tj
T*(Based on the properties of the dust grainsâ€”high temperature, high albedo and )Tj
T*(strong 10Â Î¼m silicate emission featureâ€”the astronomers concluded the dust )Tj
T*(grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.[36] )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp showed the highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. )Tj
T*(Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the )Tj
T*(dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the )Tj
T*(grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Haleâ€“Bopp )Tj
T*(were smaller than inferred in any other comet.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sodium tail )Tj
T*( One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of )Tj
T*(tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Haleâ€“Bopp also )Tj
T*(exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with )Tj
T*(dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other )Tj
T*(comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Haleâ€“Bopp's sodium tail )Tj
T*(consisted of neutral atoms \(not ions\), and extended to some 50 million )Tj
T*(kilometres in length.[38] )Tj
T*( The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner coma, although not )Tj
T*(necessarily the nucleus. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a )Tj
T*(source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding )Tj
T*(the nucleus, and 'sputtering' of sodium from dust grains by ultraviolet light. )Tj
T*(It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating )Tj
T*(Haleâ€“Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow[38] and diffuse[39] components of the )Tj
T*(tail may have different origins.[40] )Tj
T*( While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and )Tj
T*(the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail )Tj
T*(appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven )Tj
T*(away from the comet's head by radiation pressure.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Deuterium abundance )Tj
T*( The abundance of deuterium in comet Haleâ€“Bopp in the form of heavy water was )Tj
T*(found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Haleâ€“Bopp's deuterium )Tj
T*(abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts )Tj
T*(are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, )Tj
T*(they cannot be the only source.[41] )Tj
T*( Deuterium was also detected in many other hydrogen compounds in the comet. The )Tj
T*(ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to )Tj
T*(compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in )Tj
T*(interstellar clouds, rather than in the solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of )Tj
T*(ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Haleâ€“Bopp formed at )Tj
T*(temperatures of around 25â€“45Â Kelvin.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Organics )Tj
T*( Spectroscopic observations of Haleâ€“Bopp revealed the presence of many organic )Tj
T*(chemicals, several of which had never been detected in comets before. These )Tj
T*(complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus, or might be )Tj
T*(synthesised by reactions in the comet.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Detection of argon )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp was the first comet where the noble gas argon was detected.[43] )Tj
T*(Noble gases are chemically inert and highly volatile, and since different noble )Tj
T*(elements have different sublimation temperatures, they can be used for probing )Tj
T*(the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation )Tj
T*(temperature of 16â€“20Â K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative )Tj
T*(to the solar abundance,[44] while argon with its higher sublimation temperature )Tj
T*(was enriched relative to the solar abundance.[43] Together these observations )Tj
T*(indicate that the interior of Haleâ€“Bopp has always been colder than 35â€“40Â K, )Tj
T*(but has at some point been warmer than 20Â K. Unless the solar nebula was much )Tj
T*(colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the )Tj
T*(comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward )Tj
T*(to the Oort cloud.[43] )Tj

T*( Comet Haleâ€“Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its )Tj
T*(nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the )Tj
T*(material streaming away from these jets[45] allowed astronomers to measure the )Tj
T*(rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 )Tj
T*(minutes.[46] )Tj
T*( [edit] Binary nucleus question )Tj
T*( In 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary )Tj
T*(nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Haleâ€“Bopp's dust )Tj
T*(emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, )Tj
T*(and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, )Tj
T*(but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30Â km, with the main )Tj
T*(nucleus being about 70Â km across, and would orbit in about three days at a )Tj
T*(distance of about 180Â km.[47] This analysis was confirmed by observations in )Tj
T*(1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which )Tj
T*(had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.[48] )Tj
T*( Although observations using adaptive optics in late 1997 and early 1998 showed )Tj
T*(a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus,[49] controversy still exists )Tj
T*(over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus.[15] )Tj
T*(The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations.[50][51] )Tj
T*(Also, while comets have been observed to break up before,[52] no case has )Tj
T*(previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of )Tj
T*(this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the )Tj
T*(gravity of the Sun and planets. )Tj
T*( [edit] UFO claims )Tj
T*( In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek of Houston, Texas took a CCD )Tj
T*(image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. )Tj
T*(When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called )Tj
T*(the Art Bell radio program Coast to Coast AM to announce that he had discovered )Tj
T*(a "Saturn-like object" following Haleâ€“Bopp. UFO enthusiasts, such as remote )Tj
T*(viewing proponent Courtney Brown, soon concluded that there was an alien )Tj
T*(spacecraft following the comet.[53] )Tj
T*( Several astronomers, including Alan Hale,[54] claimed the object was simply an )Tj
T*(8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer )Tj
T*(program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.[55] Later, Art Bell )Tj
T*(even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous )Tj
T*(astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers )Tj
T*(Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the )Tj
T*(alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.[56] )Tj
T*( A few months later, in March 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass )Tj
T*(suicide with the intention of teleporting to a spaceship they believed was )Tj
T*(flying behind the comet.[57] )Tj
T*( Nancy Lieder, a self-proclaimed contactee who claims to receive messages from )Tj
T*(aliens through an implant in her brain, stated that Haleâ€“Bopp was a fiction )Tj
T*(designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of "Nibiru" or )Tj
T*("Planet X", a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth's )Tj
T*(rotation, causing global cataclysm.[58] Although Lieder's original date for the )Tj
T*(apocalypse, May 2003, has now passed, the imminent arrival of Nibiru is still )Tj
T*(predicted by various conspiracy websites, most of whom tie it to the 2012 )Tj
T*(phenomenon.[59] This also passed. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Its lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant )Tj
T*(that Haleâ€“Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far )Tj
T*(greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley's Comet in 1986, )Tj
T*(and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's )Tj
T*(previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Haleâ€“Bopp by )Tj
T*(April 9, 1997.[60] )Tj
T*( Haleâ€“Bopp was a record-breaking cometâ€”the farthest comet from the Sun )Tj
T*(discovered by amateurs,[20] with the largest well-measured cometary nucleus )Tj

T*( The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 \(Public Law 84-830\) was an Act )Tj
T*(of Congress passed to improve mental health care in the United States territory )Tj
T*(of Alaska. It became the focus of a major political controversy[1] after )Tj
T*(opponents nicknamed it the "Siberia Bill" and denounced it as being part of a )Tj
T*(communist plot to hospitalize and brainwash Americans. Campaigners asserted )Tj
T*(that it was part of an international Jewish, Roman Catholic or psychiatric )Tj
T*(conspiracy intended to establish United Nations-run concentration camps in the )Tj
T*(United States. )Tj
T*( The legislation in its original form was sponsored by the Democratic Party, )Tj
T*(but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican )Tj
T*(Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the )Tj
T*(legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense )Tj
T*(opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious )Tj
T*(groups was passed by the United States Senate.[2] The controversy still plays a )Tj
T*(prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against )Tj
T*(psychiatry. )Tj
T*( The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care )Tj
T*(system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health )Tj
T*(trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians )Tj
T*(systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable )Tj
T*(land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset-stripping was )Tj
T*(eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a )Tj
T*(reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid-1980s. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background to the act )Tj
T*( Alaska possessed no mental health treatment facilities prior to the passage of )Tj
T*(the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, )Tj
T*(being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of )Tj
T*(the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating )Tj
T*(back to the turn of the 19th to 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United )Tj
T*(States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of )Tj
T*(Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was )Tj
T*(signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo )Tj
T*(Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to )Tj
T*(the hospital for treatment.[3] A commitment regime was established under which )Tj
T*(a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, )Tj

T*(who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison )Tj
T*(until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a )Tj
T*(medical or psychiatric examination required.[4] )Tj
T*( By the 1940s it was recognized that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The )Tj
T*(American Medical Association conducted a series of studies in 1948, followed by )Tj
T*(a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies )Tj
T*(of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip )Tj
T*(to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, )Tj
T*(an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which )Tj
T*(owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make )Tj
T*(an excess profit of $69,000 per year \(equivalent to over $588,000 per year at )Tj
T*(2007 prices\).[3] )Tj
T*( The studies recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the system, with the )Tj
T*(development of an in-state mental health program for Alaska. This proposal was )Tj
T*(widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the )Tj
T*(second session of the 84th Congress, Representative Edith Green \(D-Oregon\) )Tj
T*(introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill \(H.R. 6376\) in the House of )Tj
T*(Representatives. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the Congressional )Tj
T*(Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator.[2] Senator )Tj
T*(Richard L. Neuberger \(D-Oregon\) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the )Tj
T*(Senate. )Tj
T*( [edit] Details of the bill )Tj
T*( The Alaska Mental Health Bill's stated purpose was to "transfer from the )Tj
T*(Federal Government to the Territory of Alaska basic responsibility for the )Tj
T*(hospitalization, care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska." In )Tj
T*(connection with this goal, it aimed: )Tj
T*( to modernize procedures for such hospitalization \(including commitment\), care, )Tj
T*(and treatment and to authorize the Territory to modify or supersede such )Tj
T*(procedures;)Tj
T*(to assist in providing for the Territory necessary facilities for a )Tj
T*(comprehensive mental-health program in Alaska, including inpatient and )Tj
T*(outpatient facilities;)Tj
T*(to provide for a land grant to the Territory to assist in placing the program )Tj
T*(on a firm long-term basis; and)Tj
T*(to provide for a ten-year program, of grants-in-aid to the Territory to enable )Tj
T*(the Territory gradually to assume the full operating costs of the program.[5])Tj
T*(  The bill provided for a cash grant of $12.5 million \(about $94 million at )Tj
T*(2007 prices\) to be disbursed to the Alaskan government in a number of phases, )Tj
T*(to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet )Tj
T*(the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres \(4,000Â )Tj
T*(kmÂ²\) of federally-owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new )Tj
T*(Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aidâ€”the federal government owned about )Tj
T*(99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then be able to use the )Tj
T*(assets of the transferred land \(principally mineral and forestry rights\) to )Tj
T*(obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. )Tj
T*(Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision )Tj
T*(of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.[4] )Tj
T*( In addition, the bill granted the Governor of Alaska authority to enter into )Tj
T*(reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other )Tj
T*(states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be )Tj
T*(properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, )Tj
T*(citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care )Tj
T*(there, before being returned to their home states.[4] )Tj
T*( The bill was seen as entirely innocuous when it was introduced on January 16, )Tj
T*(1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed )Tj
T*(unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to )Tj
T*(consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected )Tj
T*(to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on )Tj
T*(February 20.[4] )Tj

T*( [edit] Sounding the alarm )Tj
T*( In December 1955, a small anti-communist women's group in southern California, )Tj
T*(the American Public Relations Forum \(APRF\), issued an urgent call to arms in )Tj
T*(its monthly bulletin. It highlighted the proposed text of the Alaska Mental )Tj
T*(Health Bill, calling it "one that tops all of them". The bulletin writers )Tj
T*(commented: "We could not help remembering that Siberia is very near Alaska and )Tj
T*(since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant, we were wondering if )Tj
T*(it could be an American Siberia." They said that the bill "takes away all of )Tj
T*(the rights of the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect )Tj
T*(him[self] from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or 'friend' )Tj
T*(or, as the Alaska bill states, 'an interested party'."[2] )Tj
T*( The APRF had a history of opposing mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, )Tj
T*(it had played a key role in stalling the passage of three mental health bills )Tj
T*(in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right )Tj
T*(organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, )Tj
T*(anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-Jewish.[2] The Keep America Committee, )Tj
T*(another Californian "superpatriot" group, summed up the anti-mental health mood )Tj
T*(on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling "mental hygiene" )Tj
T*(part of the "unholy three" of the "Communistic World Government", it declared: )Tj
T*("Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a )Tj
T*(free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies".[6] )Tj
T*( The APRF's membership overlapped with that of the much larger Minute Women of )Tj
T*(the U.S.A., a nationwide organization of militant anti-communist housewives )Tj
T*(which claimed up to 50,000 members across the United States. In mid-January )Tj
T*(1956, Minute Woman Leigh F. Burkeland of Van Nuys, California issued a bulletin )Tj
T*(protesting against the bill. It was mimeographed by the California State )Tj
T*(Chapter of the Minute Women and mailed across the nation. On January 24, 1956, )Tj
T*(the strongly anti-Statist Santa Ana Register newspaper reprinted Burkeland's )Tj
T*(statement under the headline, "Now â€” Siberia, U.S.A." Burkeland issued a lurid )Tj
T*(warning of what the future might hold if the Alaska Mental Health Bill was )Tj
T*(passed by the Senate: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Is it the purpose of H.R. 6376 to establish a concentration camp for political )Tj
T*(prisoners under the guise of treatment of mental cases? The answer, based on a )Tj
T*(study of the bill, indicates that it is entirely within the realm of )Tj
T*(possibility that we may be establishing in Alaska our own version of the )Tj
T*(Siberia slave camps run by the Russian government. â€¦ This legislation, say its )Tj
T*(opponents, will place every resident of the United States at the mercy of the )Tj
T*(whims and fancies of any person with whom they might have a disagreement, )Tj
T*(causing a charge of 'mental illness' to be placed against them, with immediate )Tj
T*(deportation to SIBERIA, U.S.A![7])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Fanning the flames )Tj
T*( After the Santa Ana Register published its article, a nationwide network of )Tj
T*(activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. )Tj
T*(The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the white )Tj
T*(supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America )Tj
T*(League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the )Tj
T*(anti-Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C. Holdridge; and L. Ron )Tj
T*(Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which had been founded only two years earlier. )Tj
T*( Increasingly strong statements were made by the bill's opponents through the )Tj
T*(course of the spring and summer of 1956. In his February 17 bulletin, Dan Smoot )Tj
T*(told his subscribers: "I do not doubt that the Alaska Mental Health Act was )Tj
T*(written by sincere, well-intentioned men. Nonetheless, it fits into a sinister )Tj
T*(pattern which has been forming ever since the United Nations was )Tj
T*(organized."[8]Dr. George A. Snyder of Hollywood sent a letter to all members of )Tj
T*(Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health )Tj
T*(Bill's proponents for "elements of treason against the American people behind )Tj
T*(the front of the mental health program." The Keep America Committee of Los )Tj
T*(Angeles similarly called the proponents of the bill a "conspiratorial gang" )Tj

T*(that ought to be "investigated, impeached, or at least removed from office" for )Tj
T*(treason.[2] Retired brigadier general Herbert C. Holdridge sent a public letter )Tj
T*(to President Dwight Eisenhower on March 12, in which he called the bill "a )Tj
T*(dastardly attempt to establish a concentration camp in the Alaskan wastes." He )Tj
T*(went on: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(This bill establishes a weapon of violence against our citizenry far more )Tj
T*(wicked than anything ever known in recorded history â€” far worse than the )Tj
T*(Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or the violence of the )Tj
T*(Spanish Inquisition â€¦ The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks )Tj
T*(of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, )Tj
T*(and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.[3])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( For their part, America's professional health associations \(notably the )Tj
T*(American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association\) came out in )Tj
T*(favour of the bill. There was some initial opposition from the Association of )Tj
T*(American Physicians and Surgeons, a small and extremely conservative body which )Tj
T*(opposed socialized medicine; Dr. L. S. Sprague of Tucson, Arizona said in its )Tj
T*(March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to )Tj
T*(cover "everything from falling hair to ingrown toenails." However, the )Tj
T*(association modified its position after it became clear that the AMA took the )Tj
T*(opposite view.[3] )Tj
T*( By March 1956, it was being said in Washington, D.C. that the amount of )Tj
T*(correspondence on the bill exceeded anything seen since the previous high-water )Tj
T*(mark of public controversy, the Lend-Lease Act of 1941.[2] Numerous )Tj
T*(letter-writers protested to their Congressional representatives that the bill )Tj
T*(was "anti-religious" or that the land to be transferred to the Alaska Mental )Tj
T*(Health Trust would be fenced off and used as a concentration camp for the )Tj
T*(political enemies of various state governors.[9] The well-known broadcaster )Tj
T*(Fulton Lewis described how he had "received, literally, hundreds of letters )Tj
T*(protesting bitterly against the bill. I have had telephone calls to the same )Tj
T*(effect from California, Texas and other parts of the country. Members of )Tj
T*(Congress report identical reactions."[10] A letter printed in the Daily )Tj
T*(Oklahoman newspaper in May 1956 summed up many of the arguments made by )Tj
T*(opponents of the bill: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The advocates of world government, who regard patriotism as the symptom of a )Tj
T*(diseased mind, took a step closer to their goal of compulsory asylum 'cure' for )Tj
T*(opponents of UNESCO, when, on January 18, the U.S. House of Representatives )Tj
T*(passed the Alaska Mental Health Act.)Tj
T*(The Act was prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice, Department of the )Tj
T*(Interior and the socialist-oriented Department of Health, Education and )Tj
T*(Welfare. It closely follows the Model Code, drafted by the American Psychiatric )Tj

T*(All of you who don't want members of your family railroaded to an asylum had )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( During February and March 1956, hearings were held before the Senate )Tj
T*(Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs. Proponents and opponents of )Tj

T*(eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish . . . one particular race is )Tj
T*(administering this particular thing." He argued that Jews were nationalists of )Tj
T*(another country who were attempting to "usurp American nationality." [4][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Passing the bill )Tj
T*( The arguments of the bill's opponents attracted little support in the Senate. )Tj
T*(The Eisenhower administration, the Alaska territorial government and mainstream )Tj
T*(religious groups were all in favor of the bill. The Alaska Presbyterian Church )Tj
T*(gave the bill its unanimous support, issuing a statement declaring: "As )Tj
T*(Christian citizens of Alaska we believe this is a progressive measure for the )Tj
T*(care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska. We deplore the present )Tj
T*(antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill." It also urged the National )Tj
T*(Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill.[13] An overwhelming )Tj
T*(majority of senators of both parties were also supportive. The bill's original )Tj
T*(author, Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett, spoke for many of the bill's proponents )Tj
T*(when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I am completely at a loss in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain )Tj
T*(individuals and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign â€¦ to )Tj
T*(defeat the act. I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts, )Tj
T*(they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law )Tj
T*(but in working for its speedy passage and approval.[2])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Other senators expressed similar mystification at the agitation against the )Tj
T*(bill. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington stated that he was "at a loss" to )Tj
T*(see how the bill affected religion, as its opponents said.[9] Senator Alan )Tj
T*(Bible of Nevada, the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Territories and )Tj
T*(Insular Affairs, told the bill's opponents that nothing in the proposed )Tj
T*(legislation would permit the removal of any non-Alaskan to the territory for )Tj
T*(confinement.[12] )Tj
T*( Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona proposed an amended bill that )Tj
T*(removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill and stated that )Tj
T*("Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, )Tj
T*(pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person who is not a )Tj
T*(resident of Alaska." In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial )Tj
T*(elementâ€”the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 )Tj
T*(states to Alaska.[4] The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on )Tj
T*(Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended )Tj
T*(to strike all the controversial "detailed provisions for commitment, )Tj
T*(hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" included in title I of )Tj
T*(the original House bill. This amended proposal left only the transfer of )Tj
T*(responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the )Tj
T*(establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that )Tj
T*(they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that )Tj
T*(they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of )Tj
T*(the country other than Alaska. Partly as a result of this misunderstanding, but )Tj
T*(more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of )Tj
T*(Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program )Tj
T*(for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in )Tj
T*(this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.[14])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Thus amended, the Senate bill \(S. 2973\) was passed unanimously by the Senate )Tj
T*(on July 20, after only ten minutes of debate.[2][3] )Tj

T*(administer the land and grants appropriated to fund the Alaskan mental health )Tj
T*(program. During the 1970s, the issue of the trust's land became increasingly )Tj
T*(controversial, with the state coming under increasing pressure to develop the )Tj
T*(land for private and recreational use. In 1978, the Alaska Legislature passed a )Tj
T*(law to abolish the trust and transfer the most valuable parcels of lands to )Tj
T*(private individuals and the government.[15] By 1982, 40,000 acres \(160Â km2\) had )Tj
T*(been conveyed to municipalities, 50,000 acres \(200Â km2\) transferred to )Tj
T*(individuals, and slightly over 350,000 acres \(1,400Â km2\) designated as forests, )Tj
T*(parks or wildlife areas. Around 35 percent of the land trust remained )Tj
T*(unencumbered and in state ownership.[16] )Tj
T*( The loss of the land and the revenue earned from it had a severe effect on )Tj
T*(mental health care in the state.[citation needed] In 1982, Alaska resident Vern )Tj
T*(Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son, who required mental health services )Tj
T*(that were not available in Alaska. The case of Weiss v State of Alaska )Tj
T*(eventually became a class action lawsuit involving a range of mental health )Tj
T*(care groups. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the abolition of the )Tj
T*(trust had been illegal and ordered it to be reconstituted. However, as much of )Tj
T*(the original land had been transferred away, the parties had to undergo a long )Tj
T*(and complex series of negotiations to resolve the situation. A final settlement )Tj
T*(was reached in 1994 in which the trust was reconstituted with 500,000 acres )Tj
T*(\(2,000Â km2\) of original trust land, 500,000 acres \(2,000Â km2\) of replacement )Tj
T*(land, and $200 million to replace lost income and assets.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientology and the Alaska Mental Health Bill )Tj
T*( The Alaska Mental Health Bill plays a major part in the Church of )Tj
T*(Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry. The Church )Tj
T*(participated in the campaign against the Bill and still refers to it as the )Tj
T*("Siberia Bill". Scientology may also have provided an important piece of the )Tj
T*("evidence" which the anti-bill campaigners used â€” a booklet titled )Tj
T*(Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics, which has )Tj
T*(been widely attributed to the anonymous authorship of L. Ron Hubbard \(see )Tj
T*(Brainwashing Manual\). )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientology position )Tj
T*( The church's official website asserts that the bill was "psychiatry's attempt )Tj
T*(to establish a million-acre \(4,000 kmÂ²\) Siberia-type camp for mental health )Tj
T*(patients in Alaska, far from the prying eyes of civil libertarians"[17] which )Tj
T*("presumably ... was far enough away from the well-traveled roads of the world )Tj
T*(to allow psychiatrists to conduct their mind control and other experiments on a )Tj
T*(captive population, unhindered by the glare of publicity."[18] It would give )Tj
T*(psychiatrists the power to ensure that "Any man, woman or child could be seized )Tj
T*(and sent without trial to Alaska, deprived of human and civil rights and )Tj
T*(detained forever, all without trial or examination."[19] According to the )Tj
T*(Church's Freedom Magazine: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(the bill came to the attention of Scientologists in 1956, only two years after )Tj
T*(the Church of Scientology had been established. â€¦ Scientologists responded with )Tj
T*(a campaign to inform the public of the very real threat to personal liberties )Tj
T*(and freedom of speech posed by the measure. If passed, it would have created a )Tj
T*(potential "gulag" where political undesirables could be dumped and simply )Tj
T*(forgotten. The hope of creating this psychiatric slave state was shattered by )Tj
T*(Scientologists. Refusing to allow vested interests to destroy the right of )Tj
T*(every citizen to freely speak his opinions without fear of retaliation they )Tj
T*(instituted a huge grassroots letter campaign. This alerted the Senate to public )Tj
T*(opposition and testimony was presented at Senate Committee hearings on the )Tj
T*(bill. Ultimately, except for granting a small amount of money for Alaska to )Tj
T*(continue "treating" its few existing mental patients, the Senate rejected the )Tj
T*(Siberia bill and it was never heard of again.[20])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Church officials have stated their belief that the American Psychiatric )Tj
T*(Association intensified its "interest in destroying Dianetics and Scientology )Tj

T*(of who was behind the massive response that defeated the legislation, and they )Tj
T*(never forgot, as can be seen from some of the attacks its members )Tj
T*(generated."[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Miscavige on Nightline )Tj
T*( Similarly, David Miscavige, the church's leader, in 1992 told Ted Koppel in an )Tj
T*(interview on the Nightline program: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I don't know if you're aware that there was a plan in 1955 in this country, )Tj
T*(Ted, to repeat what was done in Russia. There was going to be a Siberia, U.S.A. )Tj
T*(set up on a million acres \(4,000 kmÂ²\) in Alaska to send mental patients. They )Tj
T*(were going to lessen the commitment laws, you could basically get into an )Tj
T*(argument with somebody and be sent up there. This sounds very odd. Nobody's )Tj
T*(ever heard about it. That's in no small part thanks to the Church of )Tj
T*(Scientology. I must say, though, that when that bill was killed in Congress, )Tj
T*(the war was on with psychiatry where they declared war on us â€¦ It was a major, )Tj
T*(major, major flap for the psychiatrists when it got voted down, because then )Tj
T*(the slogan around the country began, 'Siberia U.S.A.,' and it was really the )Tj
T*(first time that psychiatry had been denigrated publicly, that they weren't the )Tj
T*(science that they had been promoting themselves to be. And they took it upon )Tj
T*(themselves then to start dealing with anybody who would oppose them.[22])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Conspiracy theories )Tj
T*( In Ron's Journal 67, Hubbard identified "the people behind the Siberia Bill", )Tj
T*(who he asserted were )Tj
T*( less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher )Tj
T*(financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly )Tj
T*(enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have )Tj
T*(sprung up. Now these chaps are very interesting fellows: They have )Tj
T*(fantastically corrupt backgrounds; illegitimate children; government graft; a )Tj
T*(very unsavory lot. And they apparently, sometime in the rather distant past, )Tj
T*(had determined on a course of action. Being in control of most of the gold )Tj
T*(supplies of the planet, they entered upon a program of bringing every )Tj
T*(government to bankruptcy and under their thumb, so that no government would be )Tj
T*(able to act politically without their permission.[23])Tj
T*(  According to David Miscavige, the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the )Tj
T*(American Psychiatric Association. In a public address in 1995, he told )Tj
T*(Scientologists that it was "in 1955 that the agents for the American )Tj
T*(Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia )Tj
T*(Bill, calling for a secret concentration camp in the wastes of Alaska." It was )Tj
T*("here that Mr. Hubbard, as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement, )Tj
T*(knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring â€” inflicting a blow they would )Tj
T*(never forget." [24] The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made )Tj
T*(frequently in Scientology literature.[25] In fact, the original version of the )Tj
T*(bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of )Tj
T*(Representatives; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the )Tj
T*(commitment portion and retain the transfer of responsibility for mental health )Tj
T*(care. The revised bill passed easily without further changes.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contemporary publications )Tj
T*( Contemporary Church publications suggest that although Hubbard was tracking )Tj
T*(progress of the bill at least as early as February 1956, Scientology did not )Tj
T*(become involved in the controversy until the start of March 1956, over two )Tj
T*(months after the American Public Relations Forum had first publicized the bill. )Tj
T*(A March "Professional Auditor's Bulletin" issued by Hubbard, who was staying in )Tj
T*(Dublin at the time, includes a telegram from his Washington-based son L. Ron )Tj
T*(Hubbard, Jr. and two other Scientologists alerting him to the upcoming February )Tj

T*( Thurisind lost his eldest son, Turismod, in the Battle of Asfeld, during which )Tj
T*(the prince was killed by Alboin, son of Audoin. In about 560, Thurisind died )Tj
T*(and was succeeded by his remaining son Cunimund, who was killed by Alboin in )Tj
T*(567. Cunimund's death marked the end of the Gepid Kingdom and the beginning of )Tj
T*(the conquest of their territories by the Lombards' allies, the Avars, a nomadic )Tj
T*(people migrating from the Eurasian Steppe. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early sources )Tj
T*( Of the four early medieval sources relevant to Thurisind that survive,[1] the )Tj
T*(only one providing independent evidence of the king, accounts of Justinian's )Tj
T*(wars, and a detailed account of the relations between Gepids and Lombards and )Tj
T*(their kings is De Bellis \(550s\), the most important work of Procopius.[2][3] )Tj
T*(Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century, Procopius was a Greek )Tj
T*(writer born in Caesarea in Palestine in 527.[4] The Lombardâ€“Gepid wars are well )Tj
T*(described in Procopius' work, as the conflict played an important part in the )Tj
T*(Byzantine plans to invade Italy by a land route.[5] )Tj
T*( Less relevant is the other 6th-century source, Jordanes' Romana. Of Gothic )Tj
T*(ancestry, Jordanes served as a notarius for a Byzantine Master of the Soldiers )Tj
T*(before entering into the ranks of the Catholic clergy and writing his two )Tj
T*(surviving books, the Romana and the Getica. The latter is a summary of Gothic )Tj
T*(history, while the lesser known Romana is an abridged account of Roman history )Tj
T*(written in 551 or 552. According to James O'Donnell, the two works share a )Tj
T*(pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are )Tj
T*(insignificant compared to religious goals.[6][7] Jordanes does not explicitly )Tj
T*(mention Thurisind in the Romana, but speaks of the third Lombardâ€“Gepid War, in )Tj
T*(which Thurisind participated, in the last passages of the work.[8] )Tj
T*( Paul the Deacon was the most important Italian writer of the 8th century.[9] )Tj
T*(Born in the 720s or 730s, he came from a noble Lombard family from Friuli. He )Tj
T*(entered the clergy early, and eventually became a monk of the monastery of )Tj
T*(Monte Cassino. His most famous work is the Historia Langobardorum, a history of )Tj
T*(the Lombard nation. Written after 787, it is a continuation of his previous )Tj
T*(major historical work, the Historia Romana, which was based on the Breviarium )Tj
T*(of Eutropius, with six books added describing historical events up to )Tj
T*(Justinian's empire.[9][10] Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third )Tj
T*(Lombardâ€“Gepid War, which represent the only overlap between the Historia )Tj
T*(Langobardorum and the Historia Romana. Both books also mention the duel between )Tj
T*(the kings' sons, an event which is absent in Procopius' writing and is thought )Tj
T*(to have originated through oral tradition.[11] Similarly, the meeting between )Tj
T*(Thurisind and Audoin's son at the former's court derives from an oral )Tj
T*(source.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Rise to power )Tj
T*( The Gepids were a major East Germanic people in what is now eastern Hungary, )Tj
T*(western Romania, and northern Serbia. Although the details of his early life )Tj
T*(are not known, Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548.[13] )Tj
T*(After the death of Elemund, the previous king, he seized the throne in a coup )Tj
T*(d'Ã©tat and forced Elemund's son Ostrogotha into exile.[14] Ostrogotha and his )Tj
T*(followers found refuge among the Gepids' neighbours and enemies, the Lombards, )Tj
T*(another Germanic people who had just settled in the western part of the )Tj
T*(Pannonian Basin.[15][16] The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the )Tj
T*(3rd century. They reached prominence in the 5th century when, under King )Tj
T*(Ardaric, they played a key role in destroying the Hunnic Empire. Ardaric and )Tj
T*(his people benefited more than anybody else from this victory, gaining the )Tj
T*(former Roman province of Dacia.[17] )Tj
T*( In 504 the Gepids' power was significantly reduced by the Ostrogoths, who cut )Tj
T*(short their expansion into the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted )Tj
T*(themselves to the eastern part of the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the )Tj

T*(plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and made it difficult to maintain the )Tj
T*(succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made )Tj
T*(Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an )Tj
T*(important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent \(in early )Tj
T*(Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of )Tj
T*(succession\). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander )Tj
T*(in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] First war with the Lombards )Tj
T*( On becoming king in 548, Thurisind immediately found himself in a difficult )Tj
T*(situation. Sometime during 546[22]â€“548,[23][24][25] the Byzantine Empire had )Tj
T*(conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia \(modern )Tj
T*(Hungary\), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped )Tj
T*(this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing )Tj
T*(the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the )Tj
T*(Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had )Tj
T*(been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian wanted to be able to )Tj
T*(rush troops to Italy if they were needed.[26][27] )Tj
T*( According to the contemporary Procopius in the De Bello Gothico \(the section )Tj
T*(of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War\),[28] Justinian resented the takeover )Tj
T*(by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, which may have been )Tj
T*(voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the )Tj
T*(Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought )Tj
T*(to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed )Tj
T*(in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had )Tj
T*(cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the )Tj
T*(loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis \(Serbia\) and Singidunum \(Belgrade\). )Tj
T*(Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and )Tj
T*(Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to )Tj
T*(set them against in the Lombards.[29][30][31][32] )Tj
T*( The build-up towards a war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started )Tj
T*(possibly in 548 or 549,[22] with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy )Tj
T*(to Justinian's court at Constantinople, in attempts to obtain military support )Tj
T*(from Justinian or at least, in the case of Thurisind, to get a pledge of )Tj
T*(neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long )Tj
T*(tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. )Tj
T*(However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and )Tj
T*(promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, )Tj
T*(this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, )Tj
T*(because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land )Tj
T*(communications between Italy and the Balkans.[33] )Tj
T*( Historians debate as to when the conflict started. Proposed dates for the )Tj
T*(first war are either 547[34] or 549.[24][33] At the same time as the two )Tj
T*(peoples took the field, a 10,000-strong Byzantine horse army under the command )Tj
T*(of John, the magister militum of Illyricum, marched against the Gepids. Before )Tj
T*(John's arrival, Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted. As a )Tj
T*(result, when the Byzantines arrived, the war had already ended, but not before )Tj
T*(they had clashed with the Gepids' Herulian allies.[24][35][36] To seal the )Tj
T*(truce, Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up Ildigis, a pretender to )Tj
T*(the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court. Thurisind refused, but he )Tj
T*(did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge.[34][36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Second Lombardâ€“Gepid War and tensions with Justinian )Tj
T*("So the Gepaedes and the Lombards advanced in full force against each other, )Tj
T*(both being fully prepared for war. And the commanders were, on the side of the )Tj

T*(battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted )Tj
T*(Audoin's request for a two-year truce.[34][36][38] According to IstvÃ¡n BonÃ¡, )Tj
T*(the panic may be linked to a natural phenomenon: a lunar eclipse took place on )Tj
T*(June 25/26, 549.[35] )Tj
T*( Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire, and faced with the )Tj
T*(eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's )Tj
T*(expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies as a way to pressure Justinian. )Tj
T*(He found assistance from the Kutrigurs, who he ferried across the Danube into )Tj
T*(the Byzantine Illyricum in 550[39] or 551,[40] before the truce expired and )Tj
T*(probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict.[40][41] In )Tj
T*(retrospect, it may be they arrived too late instead of too early, if the )Tj
T*(agreement had been made with the Second Lombardâ€“Gepid War in mind.[35] )Tj
T*( Faced with the Kutrigur invasion, Justinian activated his alliance against the )Tj
T*(invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, who in turn asked for help from )Tj
T*(the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, taking )Tj
T*(advantage of the fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the )Tj
T*(Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans )Tj
T*(to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black )Tj
T*(Sea.[40][41][42] )Tj
T*( Thurisind protected and promoted another enemy of Byzantium, the Sclaveni. As )Tj
T*(with the Kutrigurs, Thurisind used his control of the Danube to ferry Slavic )Tj
T*(raiders to and from Byzantine territory, and obtained payment from them in the )Tj
T*(process.[39][40] )Tj
T*( [edit] Third Lombardâ€“Gepid War )Tj
T*( Justinian's plans to send expeditionary forces against the Ostrogoths in Italy )Tj
T*(were repeatedly hampered by Thurisind's initiatives. For example, Narses' army )Tj
T*(left Constantinople in April 551 for Salona, with hopes of finally defeating )Tj
T*(the Goths, but found itself blocked at Philippopolis \(Plovdiv\) by the )Tj
T*(Kutrigurs.[43][44] )Tj
T*( This brought Justinian to search for an accord with Thurisind to stop the )Tj
T*(trans-Danubian raids, and the latter was more than happy to accept. Thurisind's )Tj
T*(envoys asked for an alliance like the one bonding Byzantines and Lombards. In )Tj
T*(addition to strengthening the alliance, they demanded, and got, 12Â senators to )Tj
T*(swear to uphold the treaty.[44] After this, in 551, 400Â Gepids were sent to )Tj
T*(fight in Narses' army, which was sent to Italyâ€”a modest army compared to the )Tj
T*(5,500Â Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli.[45][46] )Tj
T*( When the truce expired in 552, Thurisind and Audoin again took to the field, )Tj
T*(and this time the clash was unavoidable. Audoin had reached an agreement with )Tj
T*(Justinian by which the Byzantines promised to send him military support in )Tj
T*(exchange for the 5,500 Lombards sent to help the Byzantine general Narses in )Tj
T*(the Emperor's war in Italy.[38][45] )Tj
T*( The two-year truce was now close to expiry and the Lombards asked the )Tj
T*(Byzantines to respect the alliance which had been established between them. The )Tj
T*(Emperor found an excuse to break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming )Tj
T*(they had again ferried Slav raiders. He put together an army with renowned )Tj
T*(commanders in its ranks such as Germanus' sons Justin and Justinian, Aratius, )Tj
T*(the Herulian Suartua, and Amalafrid, brother-in-law of Audoin. A revolt that )Tj
T*(erupted in Ulpiana diverted the bulk of the army; only a force under Amalafrid )Tj
T*(reached the battlefield.[47] )Tj
T*( Scholars debate when the third Lombardâ€“Gepid War started; it is agreed that it )Tj
T*(took place two years after the second war. The possible dates are either )Tj
T*(551[34][48] or 552.[22][45] The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that )Tj
T*(since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' )Tj
T*(Italian campaign, the third Lombardâ€“Gepid War must have already ended by then; )Tj
T*(against this scholars such as Walter Pohl protest that this is in contradiction )Tj
T*(with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the )Tj
T*(Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.[33] )Tj
T*( When the treaty expired, Audoin attacked the Gepids and Thurisind was crushed )Tj
T*(in the decisive battle of the Asfeld held west of Sirmium. The battle was )Tj
T*(mentioned by Jordanes in the Romana as one of the most bloody ever fought in )Tj

T*(Paul the DeaconHistoria Langobardorum, Book I, Ch. 24)Tj
T*( The Gepids' defeat caused a geopolitical shift in the Pannonian Basin, as it )Tj
T*(ended the danger represented by the Gepids to the Empire.[26] The Gepids' utter )Tj
T*(defeat could have meant the end of their kingdom and its conquest by the )Tj
T*(Lombards, but Justinian, wanting to maintain an equilibrium in the region, )Tj
T*(imposed an "eternal peace" that saved the Gepids; it was observed for ten )Tj
T*(years, surviving both Thurisind and Audoin. It may be on this occasion, and not )Tj
T*(before the war, that Lombards and Gepids sent troops to Narses as part of the )Tj
T*(peace treaty imposed by the Byzantines. In this interpretation, the small )Tj
T*(number of Gepid warriors sent could be explained with the heavy losses taken in )Tj
T*(the war and the resentment felt towards Justinian.[13][45][48][53][54] The )Tj
T*(Emperor also imposed some territorial concessions on Thurisind, obligating him )Tj
T*(to return Dacia ripensis and the territory of Singidunum.[55] )Tj
T*( To reach a complete peace Thurisind had first to deal with Ildigis who had )Tj
T*(found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him )Tj
T*(turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his )Tj
T*(reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, did not want to )Tj
T*(openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by )Tj
T*(demanding in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him; in the end, to avoid )Tj
T*(both openly giving in and at the same time renewing the war, both kings )Tj
T*(murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the )Tj
T*(act.[15][22][56][57] )Tj
T*( Thurisind features prominently in a tale told by Paul the Deacon set in 552, )Tj
T*(just after the death of the king's son Turismod and the end of the war.[58] The )Tj
T*(story, generally thought to track its origins to an heroic poem dedicated to )Tj
T*(Alboin,[59] revolves around the characters of Alboin and Thurisind: in )Tj
T*(accordance with a custom of the Lombards, to obtain the right to sit at his )Tj
T*(father's table, Alboin must ask for hospitality from a foreign king and have )Tj
T*(the latter arm him. To submit himself to this initiation, Alboin went with 40Â )Tj
T*(companions to Thurisind's court.[60][61] )Tj
T*( Thurisind, in observance of the laws of hospitality, received Alboin and his )Tj
T*(companions and organized a banquet in their honour, offering Alboin the place )Tj
T*(where his dead son habitually sat. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother )Tj
T*(Cunimund and Alboin's rejoinder, a clash was avoided by Thurisind's )Tj
T*(intervention, who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod's )Tj
T*(arms.[60][62] According to IstvÃ¡n BonÃ¡, who believes in the veracity of the )Tj
T*(story, the event may have taken place as described by Paul, but it also could )Tj
T*(reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the )Tj
T*(Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.[59] )Tj
T*( Thurisind died around 560 and was succeeded by his son Cunimund, last king of )Tj
T*(the Gepids; under him Thurisind's people were annihilated in 567 by a joint )Tj
T*(coalition of the Lombards and the Avars, a Turkic nomad people that in 558 had )Tj
T*(migrated to Central Europe.[63] Cunimund was killed on the battlefield by the )Tj
T*(new Lombard King Alboin, and his daughter Rosamund was taken captive.[13][64] )Tj

T*( The Avery Coonley School \(ACS\), commonly called Avery Coonley, is an )Tj
T*(independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in )Tj
T*(preschool through eighth grade \(approximately ages 3 to 14\), and is located in )Tj
T*(Downers Grove, Illinois, U.S. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the )Tj
T*(progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other )Tj
T*(turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model )Tj
T*(for progressive education well into the 1940s.[4] From 1943 to 1965, Avery )Tj
T*(Coonley was part of the National College of Education \(now National-Louis )Tj
T*(University\), serving as a living laboratory for teacher training and )Tj
T*(educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a )Tj
T*(leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of )Tj
T*(the gifted. )Tj
T*( The school has occupied several structures in its history, including a small )Tj
T*(cottage on the Coonley Estate in Riverside, Illinois, and another building )Tj
T*(designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It moved to Downers Grove in 1916 and became )Tj
T*(the Avery Coonley School in 1929, with a new 10.45-acre \(4.23Â ha\) campus )Tj
T*(designed in the Prairie and Arts and Crafts styles, landscaped by Jens Jensen, )Tj
T*(who was known as "dean of the world's landscape architects."[5] The campus has )Tj
T*(been expanded several times since the 1980s to create more space for arts, )Tj
T*(technology, and classrooms. Avery Coonley was added to the National Register of )Tj
T*(Historic Places in 2007, citing the "long-lasting influence on schools )Tj
T*(throughout the country"[6] of the educational program and the design of the )Tj
T*(building and grounds. )Tj
T*( The progressive legacy is still evident in the modern curriculum, which )Tj
T*(retains many traditions and educational activities dating back to the beginning )Tj
T*(of the school. Students work a minimum of one year above their current grade )Tj
T*(level, and explore broad themes allowing them to learn across subjects and )Tj
T*(engage in creative and collaborative projects, using instructional technology )Tj
T*(extensively. Opportunities to build on classroom studies are offered through a )Tj
T*(range of extracurricular activities. Admission is competitive and an IQ score )Tj
T*(of at least 120 is required. ACS is notable for its record of success in )Tj
T*(academic competitions at the state and national levels in mathematics, science, )Tj
T*(geography, and other subjects. ACS was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School by )Tj
T*(the United States Department of Education in 1988. Avery Coonley attracted )Tj
T*(national media attention in 1994 when the school was banned from competition in )Tj
T*(the Illinois State Science Fair after winning for the fourth year in a row. )Tj
T*(Although the decision was later reversed, the controversy was decried by the )Tj
T*(press as an example of the "dumbing down"[7] of education and the victory of )Tj
T*(self-esteem over excellence in schools. )Tj

T*(to kindergartners but to children of all ages. Dewey wrote that the primary )Tj
T*(role of the school is to train children in cooperative living, the root of all )Tj
T*(learning is the activity of the child and not external material, and directing )Tj
T*(children's spontaneous impulses towards maintaining the collective life of the )Tj
T*(school is how they become prepared for adult life.[11] Convinced of these )Tj
T*(principles, Coonley sought to enroll her four-year-old daughter in the )Tj
T*(Riverside School, one of the few public kindergartens in the area, but was )Tj
T*(disappointed when the child was not eligible because she had not yet turned )Tj
T*(five.[9] )Tj
T*( Coonley persuaded the director of the Riverside program, Lucia Burton Morse, )Tj
T*(and her assistant, Charlotte Krum, to help launch a new school. Morse and Krum )Tj
T*(had attended Elizabeth Harrison's Kindergarten College,a[â€º] which "championed )Tj
T*(the concept of kindergarten teaching in America and was one of the first )Tj
T*(teacher's colleges in the country to offer a four-year program culminating in )Tj
T*(the bachelor of education degree".[12][13] There they had studied the )Tj
T*(educational theories of John Dewey and others, who stood opposed to the more )Tj
T*(traditional pedagogical practices of the day, which saw education as the )Tj
T*(business of transmitting long-standing bodies of information to new generations )Tj
T*(and inculcating moral training based on rules and standards of conduct.[14] )Tj
T*(Their new progressive views of education emphasized an individualized approach )Tj
T*(to education and an integrated curriculum where children learned from )Tj
T*(experience and social interaction. According to Dewey, "it is a cardinal )Tj
T*(precept of the newer school of education that the beginning of instruction )Tj
T*(shall be made with the experience learners already have; that this experience )Tj
T*(and the capacities that have been developed during its course provide the )Tj
T*(starting point for all further learning."[15] These ideas laid the foundations )Tj
T*(of what would become the "progressive movement" in education. Coonley, Morse, )Tj
T*(and Krum brought these ideas with them to the new school, which Coonley )Tj
T*(described as "a Children's Community. Its purpose was not so much to teach what )Tj
T*(others had thought or grown-ups had done, but for the children themselves to do )Tj
T*(something."[16] )Tj
T*( A small cottage on the Coonley estate served as the first school building, )Tj
T*(reflected by its original name, the Cottage School. The designer was Charles )Tj
T*(Whittlesey, who had apprenticed under Louis Sullivan. The estate's main )Tj
T*(building, the Avery Coonley House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is now a )Tj
T*(National Historic Landmark.[18] Over the years, many of the estate's buildings )Tj
T*(would be pressed into use as classrooms and residences for teachers.[9] As new )Tj
T*(grades were added the school grew, and in 1911 Coonley commissioned Wright to )Tj
T*(design a larger space for the students. The new building was completed in 1912 )Tj
T*(and became known as the Coonley Playhouse,[19] and featured dozens of brightly )Tj
T*(colored art glass windows, evoking flags, balloons, and confetti in what Wright )Tj
T*(referred to as a "kinder-symphony". "Their bright primary colors and lively )Tj
T*(geometric designs make them some of Wright's most famous windows."[20]b[â€º] )Tj
T*( Two years of kindergarten were offered, beginning at age four, and students )Tj
T*(progressed through to first grade with other students their age. The Cottage )Tj
T*(School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own )Tj
T*(resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The )Tj
T*(Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and )Tj
T*(raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn )Tj
T*(featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which )Tj
T*(examined how progressive schools around the country put new educational ideas )Tj
T*(into action.[21] They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured )Tj
T*(in school life, noting that "they have, for example, a rare bird that is as )Tj
T*(much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, )Tj
T*(having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more )Tj
T*(interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on )Tj
T*(the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still )Tj
T*(do all the work of caring for him."[22] The Deweys held the Cottage School as )Tj
T*(an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, )Tj
T*(self-government, and public service: "The school organized by the pupils into a )Tj

T*(rest of the town interested in the problem."[23] The teaching of English was )Tj
T*(also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history )Tj
T*(lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, "The emphasis is )Tj
T*(put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample )Tj
T*(opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing."[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Junior Elementary School \(1916â€“1929\) )Tj
T*( At the same time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a )Tj
T*(kindergarten in the nearby town of Downers Grove, which did not have a public )Tj
T*(school.c[â€º] Coonley purchased land on Grove Street and commissioned the )Tj
T*(architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows &amp; Hamilton to design the building. )Tj
T*(The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the Kindergarten Extension )Tj
T*(Association School in 1912.[9] In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a )Tj
T*(first grade program was launched at the Downers Grove kindergarten, which was )Tj
T*(renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a second )Tj
T*(grade class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a third )Tj
T*(grade in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a fourth grade for nine-year-old )Tj
T*(students shortly thereafter.[26] )Tj
T*( The Coonleys moved to Washington, D.C. in 1916,[9] and while Queene continued )Tj
T*(to devote her time and money, she left the day-to-day direction of the school )Tj
T*(to Morse. Under her direction, the Junior Elementary School built upon the )Tj
T*(educational foundations established at the Cottage School, with its focus on )Tj
T*(the active participation of the students. Drama, music, and dance were )Tj
T*(important parts of the curriculum, and nature study remained an integral )Tj
T*(component of students' activities. These ideas, and nature study in particular, )Tj
T*(were largely the creation of Colonel Francis Wayland Parker, whom John Dewey )Tj
T*(once referred to as "the father of progressive education".[27] The Junior )Tj
T*(Elementary School was a proving ground for these principles, which called for a )Tj
T*(new way of relating to students, allowing them to freely experience their )Tj
T*(lessons on their own terms. No distinction was made between boys' and girls' )Tj
T*(activities, which included gardening, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley recalled )Tj
T*(that "[w]e had boys and girls. We made no distinction, boys and girls cooked, )Tj
T*(boys and girls did carpenter work, boys and girls took an equal part in all )Tj
T*(matters of government."[16] Students re-enacted history and literature, )Tj
T*(composed their own music, and spent much of their time outdoors.[28] In 1924, )Tj
T*(Coonley and Morse helped found a journal entitled Progressive Education, in )Tj
T*(which they published their own practical experiences at the school, accompanied )Tj
T*(by articles written by leading educational theorists, including John )Tj
T*(Dewey.[29][30] It became the leading professional journal of the progressive )Tj
T*(education movement and was published until 1957.[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Avery Coonley School \(1929â€“1960s\) )Tj
T*( Enrollment continued to grow, and a second building was added to the Junior )Tj
T*(Elementary School campus in the late 1920s, but still larger facilities were )Tj
T*(deemed necessary to accommodate future growth and additional grade levels. )Tj
T*(Coonley chose a wooded tract in Downers Grove, adjacent to the Maple Grove )Tj
T*(Forest Preserve, as the site for the new building,[33] and her son-in-law, )Tj
T*(Waldron Faulkner, became the architect of the new building project.[34]d[â€º] )Tj
T*(Over one hundred students attended school in the opened building on September )Tj
T*(30, 1929, and it was renamed The Avery Coonley School, in honor of Coonley's )Tj
T*(late husband, who had died in 1920.[35] Coonley chose an unusual mascot to )Tj
T*(represent the ideals of the school. She felt a seahorse was an example of a )Tj
T*(unique creature who was also a member of a larger communityâ€”an analogy for her )Tj
T*(vision for Avery Coonley. The seahorse swims upright, from which derives the )Tj
T*(school motto: "Onward and Upward",[36] and representations of seahorses are )Tj

T*(other professional journals,[38] and in 1938, the editor of Progressive )Tj
T*(Education, Gertrude Hartman,[38] published a profile of the Avery Coonley )Tj
T*(School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, )Tj
T*("[v]isitors from all parts of the United States and from foreign countries )Tj
T*([came] to see the schoolâ€”sometimes as many as thirty in a day."[39] Hartman )Tj
T*(described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which )Tj
T*(had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that "the most )Tj
T*(noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades )Tj
T*(itÂ ... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the )Tj
T*(work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad )Tj
T*(areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however )Tj
T*(are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions."[40] The )Tj
T*(book described the progress of the students from their first year of )Tj
T*(kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, )Tj
T*(and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and )Tj
T*(other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded )Tj
T*(with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in )Tj
T*(developing social responsibility: "It is the belief of those concerned with the )Tj
T*(school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more )Tj
T*(socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation )Tj
T*(has producedÂ ... The method in which those in the school place their faith is )Tj
T*(the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their )Tj
T*(growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new )Tj
T*(attitude towards human relations can evolve."[41]Finding Wisdom became a )Tj
T*(classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's )Tj
T*(national reputation as a model of progressive education.[42] )Tj
T*( Morse died in 1940, after 34 years as director, and several years went by )Tj
T*(without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, )Tj
T*(Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education \(NCE, )Tj
T*(formerly the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University\) in )Tj
T*(Evanston, Illinois, in 1943.[43] The two institutions had close ties dating )Tj
T*(back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement took advantage )Tj
T*(of the NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a )Tj
T*(living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE )Tj
T*(management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical )Tj
T*(learning, outdoor educationâ€”including farmingâ€”and hands-on activities like )Tj
T*(automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students )Tj
T*(beginning conversational French in first grade.[44] )Tj
T*( Coonley died in 1958;[45] ACS had looked to Coonley for her leadership over )Tj
T*(the years but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in )Tj
T*(1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused )Tj
T*(serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster )Tj
T*(John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from )Tj
T*(the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was )Tj
T*(added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined over the years )Tj
T*(and Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing )Tj
T*(prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which )Tj
T*(brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.[46] )Tj
T*( In 1965, the benefits of the National College of Education partnership were )Tj
T*(less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the )Tj
T*(NCE.[43] Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. )Tj
T*(Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners )Tj
T*(were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. )Tj
T*(Malach's stance was that "we don't believe a child should be taught because he )Tj
T*(or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read )Tj
T*(when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works )Tj
T*(individually with the child at his or her own pace."[47] By this time, however, )Tj
T*(the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become "conventional )Tj
T*(wisdom"[48] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public )Tj
T*(schools. As part of Malach's "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery )Tj

T*(Independent Schools Association of the Central States \(ISACS\) in 1961. ISACS )Tj
T*(was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and )Tj
T*(instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery )Tj
T*(Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office )Tj
T*(was dissolved in 2000.[50] )Tj
T*( Malach also established the Institute for Educational Research \(IER\) in 1964 )Tj
T*(as a center for educational experimentation. The Institute, headquartered at )Tj
T*(ACS,[51] was a joint venture with more than thirty public school districts, )Tj
T*(which collaborated on research projects and shared in the findings. The large )Tj
T*(number of schools involved ensured that statistically significant research )Tj
T*(samples were available and multiple projects could be pursued at one time.[52] )Tj
T*(In one of the first projects of the Institute, 36 history teachers wrote over )Tj
T*(2,000 test questions to help demonstrate that "many teachers want assistance in )Tj
T*(writing better evaluation items based on behavioral objectives".[52] Examples )Tj

T*( [edit] Gifted education \(1960sâ€“present\) )Tj
T*( The kindergarten reading program was the first step in the Avery Coonley )Tj
T*(School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which )Tj
T*(coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs of gifted children in )Tj
T*(the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the )Tj
T*(1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first )Tj
T*(acknowledgment of the characteristics of gifted children and their specific )Tj
T*(educational needs. The report found that "gifted children are, in fact, )Tj
T*(deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their )Tj
T*(abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar )Tj
T*(deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs".[53] The )Tj
T*(report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and )Tj
T*(the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach )Tj
T*(believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with )Tj
T*(the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, "the stimulation of )Tj
T*(individual interestsÂ ... the development of student initiative, the development )Tj
T*(of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability )Tj
T*(to undertake complex learning tasks."[54] )Tj
T*( In 1960, ACS began screening applicants for high intellectual potential, )Tj
T*(requiring a tested IQ above 120, achievement test results one and a half grade )Tj
T*(levels above national norms in reading and math, and intensive in-person )Tj
T*(evaluations.[47] At the same time, the teachers began adapting the curriculum )Tj
T*(to meet the goals of a gifted program, allowing even more differentiation for )Tj
T*(each student, accommodating different learning styles, and incorporating enough )Tj
T*(flexibility for all students to progress at their own pace.[55] )Tj
T*( More accelerated classes were added, but the core of the gifted curriculum )Tj
T*(remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been )Tj
T*(central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in )Tj
T*(the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning )Tj
T*(themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient )Tj
T*(Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted )Tj
T*(curriculum.[55] In early 1980, an early childhood \(EC\) program for )Tj
T*(three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted )Tj
T*(preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. )Tj
T*(Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley )Tj
T*(introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, )Tj
T*(movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.[56] )Tj

T*(sugar maple communities are host to many threatened and endangered plant )Tj
T*(species, and bloom with trillium, trout lilies, violets, buttercups, and wild )Tj

T*(including Great Horned Owls and several species of hawks,[60] as well as a )Tj
T*(stopover for several species of migratory birds, including the Indigo Bunting, )Tj
T*(which nests there during the warm breeding season and migrates south by night )Tj
T*(in the winter.[59] A 1.1-mile \(1.8Â km\) hiking trail winds through the preserve, )Tj
T*(crossing a small creek and passing a nearby pond.[60] The preserve is used by )Tj
T*(students in their science and nature activities.[47] )Tj
T*( The designer of the grounds, Jens Jensen,[61] was known as the "dean of the )Tj
T*(world's landscape architects",[5] and "the father of the Chicago park )Tj
T*(system",[62] for his creation of Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, the Cook County )Tj
T*(Forest Preserves, and his masterpiece, Columbus Park, in Chicago.[63]e[â€º] )Tj
T*(Jensen's work became famous for his exclusive use of plants and materials )Tj
T*(native to the local region,[62] and was characterized by his use of open )Tj
T*(spaces, flowing water, gently curving lines, and "council rings", or low )Tj
T*(circular benches where people can gather.[61] All of these features are evident )Tj
T*(on the Avery Coonley campus, which makes use of wholly natural settings in lieu )Tj
T*(of formal gardens.[64] The original landscaping was largely forgotten over the )Tj
T*(years and poorly maintained. A complete restoration of Jensen's landscape )Tj
T*(design was completed in 2006 as part of the ACS centennial celebration.[57] )Tj
T*( The building was designed by Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner,[34] who, )Tj
T*(with his son \(also an architect\) Avery Coonley Faulkner,[65] later became )Tj
T*(significant contributors to the design of George Washington University and )Tj
T*(American University in Washington, D.C.[32] The design ties the building to the )Tj
T*(land in the style of the Prairie School, at the same time employing the )Tj
T*(handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts )Tj
T*(\(or American Craftsman\) style.[6] The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor )Tj
T*(classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are )Tj
T*(among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools )Tj
T*(throughout the US after World War II.[6] )Tj
T*( The building surrounds a courtyard with a large reflecting pool. The )Tj
T*(classrooms are oriented outward, to provide views of the surrounding forest. )Tj
T*(There are no interior passages in this part of the building; each class area )Tj
T*(has an exit to the outside, and students pass between rooms via the covered )Tj
T*(cloister, even in inclement weather. The design is meant to reinforce the "home )Tj
T*(and school" atmosphere that dates back to the Cottage School, with child-sized )Tj
T*(classrooms, ten working fireplaces, draperies, and other home-like details.[66] )Tj
T*( Decorative tiles designed by Henry Chapman Mercerâ€”one of the leading figures )Tj
T*(of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.â€”are placed throughout the )Tj
T*(building.[68] These tiles \(known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian )Tj
T*(Pottery and Tile Works\) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that )Tj
T*(complement the simple brick buildings.[69] The tiles on the fireplaces and )Tj
T*(entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The )Tj
T*(Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the )Tj
T*(north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western )Tj
T*(hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.[70] )Tj
T*( In 1970, exploring new designs in school furniture, the Institute for )Tj
T*(Educational Research worked with the Design Department of Southern Illinois )Tj
T*(University to create a series of interconnected truncated octahedrons known as )Tj
T*("learning spaces", which resembled an over-sized beehive. Each child had his or )Tj

T*(The goal was to provide private spaces where third grade \(eight-year-old\) )Tj
T*(children could develop good study habits, and the school found that the )Tj
T*(children spent 90 percent of their work time in their learning spaces.[47] The )Tj
T*(structures were featured in local news stories and in Life magazine.[71] ACS )Tj

T*(building and grounds for their "unique design and features that have exerted a )Tj
T*(long-lasting influence on schools throughout the country".[73] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recent additions )Tj
T*( A new wing was added in early 1980 to provide additional space for the arts, )Tj
T*(with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling )Tj
T*(in the previously open east side of the courtyard, the design is nearly )Tj
T*(identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick )Tj
T*(with a cloister on the courtyard side.[74] The Gatehouse, which was built in )Tj
T*(1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the )Tj
T*(early childhood program in 1988.[75] )Tj
T*( Increased enrollment in the late 1980s and the need for more space led to )Tj
T*(another addition in 1992.[33] This addition included a new 17,500-volume )Tj
T*(library, a 16-station computer lab, and a 236-seat Performing Arts Center )Tj
T*(\(PAC\).[76] Moravian tiles around the new foyer fireplace and library doors pay )Tj
T*(homage to the original building.[77] The PAC "is known for its excellent )Tj
T*(acoustics",[78] and hosts student productions and outside artistic groups, )Tj
T*(including the Beck Institute for the Arts, which stages musical recitals )Tj
T*(there.[78] )Tj
T*( Avery Coonley added a full-day kindergarten program in 2005, again requiring )Tj
T*(more space, and a $4Â million, 15,000-square-foot \(1,400Â m2\)[79] middle school )Tj
T*(wing was constructed, financed through tax-exempt bonds from the Village of )Tj
T*(Downers Grove. Its cream and red bricks, hipped roof, deep eaves, and detailed )Tj
T*(brickwork harmonize with the style of the earlier building.[77] The project )Tj
T*(added modernized math and science labs, two computer labs, and seven wireless )Tj
T*(classrooms using tablet computer technology, videoconferencing, and computer )Tj
T*(controlled overhead projectors.[79] )Tj
T*( [edit] Curriculum )Tj
T*( The founding educational philosophy is still evident in the modern day )Tj
T*(curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes )Tj
T*(that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis )Tj
T*(of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily )Tj
T*(activities and a focus on the development of social skills and education for )Tj
T*(social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted )Tj
T*(students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in )Tj
T*(technology and educational research.[80] )Tj
T*( ACS refers to grade levels as groups, a practice rooted in progressive )Tj
T*(education that dates back at least to the Junior Elementary School.[81] There )Tj
T*(are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early )Tj
T*(childhood Program \(EC\) for three-year-olds and junior kindergarten \(JK\) for )Tj
T*(four-year-olds; the lower school for kindergarten through group four, and )Tj
T*(middle school for groups five through eight. Each class in kindergarten through )Tj
T*(group eight has 32Â students. Each lower school class is team taught by two )Tj
T*(teachers.[82] The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 )Tj
T*(to 1,[83] 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in )Tj
T*(the early childhood program.[84] )Tj
T*( [edit] Academic program )Tj
T*( As of 2009, the curriculum is accelerated for each group, which is separated )Tj
T*(by grade and age; students are instructed a minimum of one year above their )Tj
T*(current grade level. \(For example, the first group is taught at a second grade )Tj
T*(level.\)[85] Students are grouped within their class to allow each of them work )Tj
T*(at the level of their ability, and they may work several years beyond their )Tj
T*(current level if they can do so.[86] Students may join older groups to study )Tj
T*(subjects, which they are exceptionally advanced; however, age groups are )Tj
T*(usually kept together "for social and emotional values".[85] All middle school )Tj

T*(choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history )Tj
T*(of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.[87] )Tj
T*( The drama program begins engaging students in acting and dramatic writing, )Tj
T*(directing, and the technical arts in the fourth group. Students practice both )Tj

T*(traditions, such as the Native American Fair and class visit to the Coonley )Tj
T*(Estate, also have a long history at Avery Coonley.[96] Middle school traditions )Tj
T*(include the alternating annual Greek and Shakespeare Fests, the sixth group )Tj
T*(World's Fair, and a seventh group trip to Washington, DC.[88] )Tj
T*( In the annual Thanksgiving Program, the students, in identical brown capes, )Tj
T*(silently construct a large cornucopia of fruits and vegetables in a ceremony )Tj
T*(choreographed to music prepared by each class. The food is later donated to the )Tj

T*( Flowering has been recorded between January and October, with a peak in autumn )Tj
T*(and early winter \(April to June\).[5] The inflorescences, or flower spikes, )Tj

T*( Banksia oblongifolia can be distinguished from B.Â robur, which it often )Tj
T*(co-occurs with, by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes. B.Â robur has )Tj
T*(more metallic green flower spikes, and often grows in wetter areas within the )Tj
T*(same region. B.Â plagiocarpa has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated )Tj
T*(margins, and its flower spikes are blue-grey in bud, and later bear )Tj
T*(wedge-shaped follicles.[2] In the Sydney Basin, B.Â paludosa also bears a )Tj
T*(superficial resemblance to B.Â oblongifolia, but its leaves are more prominently )Tj
T*(spathulate \(spoon-shaped\) and tend to point up rather than down. The leaf )Tj
T*(undersides are white and lack the prominent midrib of B.Â oblongifolia, the new )Tj

T*("True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. )Tj
T*(He recognised B.Â salicifolia as the same species at this point,[11] but was )Tj
T*(unsure whether Salisbury's B.Â aspleniifolia belonged under the same name.[2] By )Tj
T*(the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were )Tj
T*(58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had )Tj
T*(been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847,[12] into four series based )Tj
T*(on leaf properties. He followed Brown in using the name B.Â oblongifolia, and )Tj
T*(placed it in the series Salicinae.[13] )Tj
T*( In 1870, George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his )Tj
T*(landmark publication Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, the number )Tj
T*(of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. He declared B.Â )Tj
T*(oblongifolia referrable to, and a synonym of, B.Â integrifolia. Bentham defined )Tj
T*(four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. B.Â )Tj
T*(integrifolia was placed in section Eubanksia.[14] )Tj
T*( Botanists in the 20th century recognised B.Â oblongifolia as a species in its )Tj
T*(own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name )Tj
T*(was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities )Tj
T*(used Banksia aspleniifolia as it was the oldest published name for the species. )Tj
T*(Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the )Tj
T*(correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's )Tj
T*(original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that )Tj
T*(it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a )Tj
T*(validly published nameâ€”the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of )Tj
T*(B.Â paludosa, B.Â integrifolia or even B.Â marginata.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Placement within Banksia )Tj
T*( The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on botanist )Tj
T*(Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series.[1] In this )Tj
T*(arrangement, B.Â oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its )Tj
T*(inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section )Tj
T*(Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its )Tj
T*(inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published )Tj
T*(in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along )Tj
T*(with B.Â plagiocarpa, B.Â robur and B.Â dentata within the series Salicinae.[15] )Tj
T*(However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.[1]B.Â )Tj

T*(thus B.Â subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped )Tj
T*(cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling )Tj
T*(of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural )Tj
T*(changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B.Â oblongifolia is placed in B.Â )Tj
T*(subg. Spathulatae.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Variation )Tj
T*( George noted that Banksia oblongifolia showed considerable variation in habit, )Tj
T*(and in 1987 Conran and Clifford separated the taxon into two subspecies. In )Tj
T*(examining populations in southern Queensland, they reported that the two forms )Tj
T*(were distinct in growth habit and habitat, and that they did not find any )Tj
T*(intermediate forms.[20] New South Wales botanists Joseph Maiden and Julius )Tj
T*(Henry Camfield had collected this taller form of B.Â oblongifolia in Kogarah in )Tj
T*(1898, and given it the name Banksia latifolia variety minorâ€”B.Â latifolia being )Tj
T*(a published name by which B.Â robur was knownâ€”before Maiden and Ernst Betche )Tj
T*(renamed it Banksia robur variety minor.[2] This name \(confusingly\) thus became )Tj
T*(the name for the taller variety. They defined variety oblongifolia as a )Tj
T*(multistemmed shrub 0.5â€“1.3Â m \(20â€“50Â in\) high, with leaves 3â€“11Â cm \(1.2â€“4.3Â in\) )Tj
T*(long and 1â€“2.5Â cm \(0.4â€“1Â in\) wide, and flower spikes 4â€“10Â cm \(1.6â€“4Â in\) high. )Tj
T*(The habitat is swamps and swamp borders, or rarely sandstone ridges. Variety )Tj
T*(minor is a taller shrub 1â€“3.5Â m \(3â€“11Â ft\) high with leaves up to 16Â cm \(6.3Â in\) )Tj
T*(long and spikes 6 to 14Â cm \(2.2â€“5.5Â in\) high. It is an understory plant in )Tj
T*(sclerophyll forests, associated with Eucalyptus signata and Banksia spinulosa )Tj
T*(var. collina. Both subspecies occur throughout the range.[20] However, George )Tj
T*(rejected the varieties, stating the variability was continuous.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Hybridization )Tj
T*( Banksia robur and B.Â oblongifolia hybrids have been recorded at several )Tj
T*(locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for The Banksia Atlas )Tj
T*(recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and Pialba in central Queensland.[3] )Tj
T*(Locales include Calga north of Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and )Tj
T*(Cordeaux Dam near Wollongong.[2] A study of an area of extensive hybridization )Tj
T*(between the two near Darkes Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney )Tj
T*(revealed extensive hybridisation in mixed species stands but almost none in )Tj
T*(pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations of )Tj
T*(crossing and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic )Tj
T*(profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of )Tj
T*(genetic hybridisation. Furthermore, there were a few plants with morphology )Tj
T*(suggestive of a third species, B.Â paludosa, in their parentage, and requiring )Tj
T*(further investigation.[21] A possible hybrid between B.Â oblongifolia and B.Â )Tj
T*(integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( Banksia oblongifolia occurs along the eastern coast of Australia from )Tj
T*(Wollongong, New South Wales in the south to Rockhampton, Queensland in the )Tj
T*(north.[3] There are isolated populations offshore on Fraser Island,[2] and )Tj
T*(inland at Blackdown Tableland National Park and Crows Nest in Queensland, and )Tj
T*(also inland incursions at the base of the Glasshouse Mountains in southern )Tj
T*(Queensland, at Grafton in northern New South Wales, and Bilpin and Lawson in )Tj
T*(the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.[3]B.Â oblongifolia grows in a range of )Tj
T*(habitatsâ€”in damp areas with poor drainage, along the edges of swamps and flats, )Tj
T*(as well as Wallum shrubland,[2] or coastal plateaux.[5] It is also found in )Tj
T*(open forest or woodland, where it grows on ridges or slopes,[2][3] or heath. )Tj
T*(Soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone-based, though granite-based and )Tj

T*( [edit] Ecology )Tj
T*( Banksia oblongifolia plants can live for more than 60 years.[5] They respond )Tj
T*(to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. )Tj
T*(Larger lignotubers have the greatest number of buds, although buds are more )Tj
T*(densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase )Tj
T*(National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within )Tj
T*(the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a )Tj
T*(fire.[23] These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years )Tj
T*(after a fire.[24] The woody infructescences also release seeds as their )Tj
T*(follicles are opened with heat,[5] although a proportion do open spontaneously )Tj
T*(at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% )Tj
T*(opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants )Tj
T*(do grow.[25] Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of )Tj
T*(seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire.[24] )Tj
T*(Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.[5] )Tj
T*( Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers )Tj

T*( Like most other proteaceae, B.Â oblongifolia has proteoid rootsâ€”roots with )Tj
T*(dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below )Tj
T*(the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient )Tj
T*(uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of )Tj
T*(Australia.[27] A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the )Tj
T*(Myall Lakes found B.Â oblongifolia on slopes \(wet heath\) and B.Â aemula grew on )Tj
T*(ridges \(dry heath\), and the two species did not overlap.[28] Manipulation of )Tj
T*(seedlings in the same study area showed that B.Â oblongifolia can grow longer )Tj
T*(roots seeking water than other wet heath species and that seedlings can )Tj
T*(establish in dry heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow )Tj
T*(in dry heath as well as wet heath.[29] Unlike similar situations with Banksia )Tj

T*(been captured by Native Americans as a child, and lived with them from the time )Tj
T*(he was sixÂ years old until he was rescued at 23. To differentiate Ross from his )Tj
T*(uncle and great-grandfather, he was called "Little Sul" when he was a child, )Tj
T*(and later "Sul."[1] )Tj
T*( Shortly after Ross's birth, his parents sold their Iowa property and returned )Tj
T*(to Missouri to escape Iowa's cold weather. In 1839, the family moved to the )Tj
T*(Republic of Texas, where they settled in the Robertson Colony on the lower )Tj
T*(Brazos River.[2][3] TwoÂ years later, they joined seven other families under )Tj
T*(Captain Daniel Monroe and settled near present-day Cameron,[3] where they )Tj
T*(received 640Â acres \(260Â ha\) of land along the Little River.[2] Their land )Tj
T*(adjoined Comanche territory and was raided several times.[2][4] )Tj
T*( In 1845, the family moved to Austin so Ross and his older siblings could )Tj
T*(attend school.[5] FourÂ years later, they relocated again. By this time Shapley )Tj
T*(Ross was well known as a frontiersman, and to coax him to settle in the newly )Tj
T*(formed community of Waco, the family was given four city lots, exclusive rights )Tj
T*(to operate a ferry across the Brazos River, and the right to buy 80 acres \(32Â )Tj
T*(ha\) of farmland at US$1 per acre.[6][7] In March 1849, the Ross family built )Tj
T*(the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin on a bluff overlooking the springs. )Tj
T*(Ross's sister Kate soon became the first Caucasian child born in Waco.[7] )Tj
T*( Eager to further his education, Ross entered the Preparatory Department at )Tj
T*(Baylor University \(then in Independence, Texas\) in 1856, despite the fact that )Tj
T*(he was several years older than most of the other students. He completed the )Tj

T*(privately in the subject.[10] At Wesleyan, students lived with prominent )Tj

T*( [edit] Wichita Village fight )Tj
T*( During the summer of 1858, Ross returned to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos )Tj
T*(Indian Reserve, where his father served as Indian Agent. The United States Army )Tj
T*(had conscripted Indians from the reserve to help the "Wichita Expedition" of )Tj
T*(2nd Cavalry in a search for Buffalo Hump, a Penateka Comanche chief who had led )Tj
T*(several deadly raids on Texas settlements. Fearing that Shapley Ross was too )Tj
T*(ill to command them on the expedition, the Indians named Sul Ross their new war )Tj
T*(chief. With his father's approval, the younger Ross led the 135Â warriors to )Tj
T*(accompany 225 troops led by brevet Major Earl Van Dorn.[12][13][14] Ross was )Tj
T*(given the courtesy title of "Captain" during his command.[12] )Tj
T*( Native scouts found approximately 500Â Comanches, including Buffalo Hump, )Tj
T*(camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory. Early in the battle, Ross )Tj
T*(and his men successfully stampeded the Comanche horses, leaving the Comanche )Tj
T*(warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops. When many Comanche )Tj
T*(tried to flee the area, Ross, one of his scouts, Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp )Tj
T*(of the 2nd Cavalry and one of his troopers chased a party of noncombatants that )Tj
T*(appeared to contain a white child.[15] On Ross's orders, his man grabbed the )Tj
T*(child; as the four turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25Â )Tj
T*(Comanche warriors.[16][17] Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows, )Tj
T*(and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder. A Comanche picked up the )Tj
T*(trooper's carbine[15] and fired a 0.58Â caliber bullet through Ross's )Tj
T*(chest.[16][18] His attacker, Mohee, was a Comanche brave Ross had known since )Tj
T*(childhood. Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the )Tj
T*(2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a )Tj
T*(scalping knife.[15][16] )Tj
T*( After fiveÂ hours of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche )Tj
T*(resistance.[19][20] Buffalo Hump escaped, but seventyÂ Comanches were killed or )Tj
T*(mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants.[15][19] Ross's injuries were )Tj
T*(severe, and for fiveÂ days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be )Tj
T*(moved.[18][20] His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill )Tj
T*(him to end his pain. When he was able to travel, he was first carried on a )Tj
T*(litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He )Tj
T*(recovered fully, but experienced some pain for much of the rest of the )Tj
T*(year.[18] )Tj
T*( In his written report, Van Dorn praised Ross highly. The Dallas Herald printed )Tj
T*(the report on October 10, and other state newspapers also praised Ross's )Tj
T*(bravery. General Winfield Scott learned of Ross's role and offered him a direct )Tj
T*(commission in the Army. Eager to finish his education, Ross declined Scott's )Tj
T*(offer and returned to school in Alabama.[20][21] )Tj
T*( The following year, Ross graduated from Wesleyan with a Bachelor of Arts and )Tj
T*(returned to Texas. Once there, he discovered that no one had been able to trace )Tj
T*(the family of the young Caucasian girl rescued during the Wichita Village )Tj

T*( Smith disbanded Ross's company in early September 1860. Within a week, )Tj
T*(Governor Sam Houston authorized Ross to raise his own company of 60 mounted )Tj
T*(volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American )Tj
T*(attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860 to find )Tj
T*(that the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution )Tj
T*(asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens )Tj
T*(erroneously believed that the raiding was committed by Native Americans from )Tj
T*(the reservations, and they feared that Ross's friendship with those on the )Tj
T*(reservations would make him ineffective.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Battle of Pease River )Tj
T*( In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona conducted )Tj
T*(numerous raids on various settlements, culminating in the brutal killing of a )Tj
T*(pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-men )Tj
T*(companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their )Tj
T*(winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500Â )Tj
T*(warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to )Tj
T*(recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp )Tj
T*(Cooper, which sent 21Â troops.[25] )Tj
T*( Immediately after the soldiers arrived on December 11, Ross and 39Â Rangers )Tj
T*(departed for the Comanche village. On December 13 they met the civilian posse, )Tj
T*(which had grown to 69Â members. After several days of travel, the fast pace and )Tj
T*(poor foraging forced the civilians to stop and rest their horses. The Rangers )Tj
T*(and soldiers continued on. When they neared the village, Ross personally )Tj
T*(scouted ahead. Hidden from view by a dust storm, he was able to get within 200 )Tj
T*(yards \(183Â m\) of the village and saw signs that the tribe was preparing to move )Tj
T*(on. Realizing that his own horses were too tired for a long pursuit, Ross )Tj
T*(resolved to attack immediately, before the civilians were able to rejoin the )Tj
T*(group. Ross lead the Rangers down the ridge, while the soldiers circled around )Tj
T*(to cut off the Comanche retreat.[26] )Tj
T*( After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross and several of his men pursued )Tj
T*(the chief and a second, unknown, rider. As the Rangers neared, the second rider )Tj
T*(slowed and held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead )Tj
T*(surrounded and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually )Tj
T*(shooting him threeÂ times. The chief refused to surrender, even after falling )Tj
T*(from his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's )Tj
T*(band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez )Tj
T*(fired the shot that took Nocona's life.[27] Nocona was the only Comanche male )Tj
T*(to die in the fighting; thirteenÂ Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men )Tj
T*(suffered no casualties.[28] )Tj
T*( The civilian posse arrived at the battleground as the fighting finished. )Tj
T*(Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them )Tj
T*(later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so that he would not )Tj
T*(have to share the glory or the spoils of war.[29] )Tj
T*( When Ross arrived back at the campground, he realized that the captured woman )Tj
T*(had blue eyes.[29] The woman could not speak English and did not remember her )Tj
T*(birth name or details of her life prior to joining the Comanche. After much )Tj
T*(questioning, she was able to provide a few details of her capture as a child. )Tj
T*(The details matched what Ross knew of the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre, so he )Tj
T*(summoned Colonel Isaac Parker to identify her. When Parker mentioned that his )Tj
T*(kidnapped niece had been named Cynthia Ann Parker, the woman slapped her chest )Tj
T*(and said "Me Cincee Ann."[30] Parker never returned to the Comanche people, but )Tj
T*(was not happy to have been rescued by Ross.[31] )Tj
T*( In contrast, Ross's intervention was welcomed by a nine-year-old Indian boy )Tj
T*(found hiding alone in the tall grass. Ross took the child with him, naming him )Tj
T*(Pease. Though Pease was later given the choice to return to his people, he )Tj
T*(refused and was raised by Ross.[32] )Tj
T*( The Battle of Pease River cemented Ross's fame. His "aggressive tactics of )Tj

T*( [edit] Resignation )Tj
T*( When Ross returned home, Houston asked him to disband the company and form a )Tj
T*(new company of 83Â men, promising to send written directives soon. While Ross )Tj
T*(was in the process of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed )Tj
T*(Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new aide-de-camp with overall command of )Tj
T*(the Texas Rangers. Dalrymple, unaware of Houston's verbal orders, castigated )Tj
T*(Ross for disbanding his company. Ross completed the reorganization of the )Tj
T*(company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission. In his letter of )Tj
T*(resignation, effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter )Tj
T*(with Dalrymple, and noted that he did not believe a Ranger company could be )Tj
T*(effective if the captain did not report solely to the Governor. Houston offered )Tj
T*(to appoint Ross as an aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel, but Ross )Tj
T*(refused.[34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Civil War service )Tj
T*( [edit] Enlistment )Tj
T*( In early 1861, after Texas voted to secede from the United States and join the )Tj
T*(Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began recruiting men for a new military )Tj
T*(company.[35] Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, )Tj
T*(Governor Edward Clark requested that he instead proceed immediately to Indian )Tj
T*(Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so that they )Tj
T*(would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie )Tj
T*(Tinsley, Ross set out for Indian Territory.[35] Upon reaching the Washita )Tj
T*(Agency, he discovered that Confederate commissioners had already signed a )Tj
T*(preliminary treaty with the tribes.[36][37] )Tj
T*( Ross returned home for several months. In the middle of August he departed, )Tj
T*(with his company, for Missouri, leaving his wife with her parents. On September )Tj
T*(7, his group became Company G of Stone's Regiment, later known as the Sixth )Tj
T*(Texas Cavalry. The other men elected Ross the major for the regiment.[38] Twice )Tj
T*(in November 1861 Ross was chosen by General McCulloch, with whom he had served )Tj
T*(in the Texas Rangers, to lead a scouting force near Springfield, Missouri. Both )Tj
T*(times, Ross successfully slipped behind the Union Army lines, gathered )Tj
T*(information, and retreated before being caught. After completing the missions, )Tj
T*(he was granted a 60-day leave and returned home to visit his wife.[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Active duty )Tj
T*( In early 1862, Ross returned to duty. By late February, he and 500 troops were )Tj
T*(assigned to raid the Union Army. He led the group 70 miles \(110Â km\) behind the )Tj
T*(enemy lines, where they gathered intelligence, destroyed several wagonloads of )Tj
T*(commissary supplies, captured 60Â horses and mules, and took 11Â prisoners.[39] )Tj
T*(The following month, the regiment was assigned to Earl Van Dorn, now a Major )Tj
T*(General, with whom Ross had served during the battle at the Wichita Village. )Tj
T*(Under Van Dorn, the group suffered a defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge; Ross )Tj
T*(attributed their loss solely to Van Dorn, and blamed him for over-marching and )Tj
T*(underfeeding his troops, and for failing to properly coordinate the plan of )Tj
T*(attack.[40] In April, the group was sent to Des Arc, Arkansas. Because of the )Tj
T*(scarcity of forage, Ross's cavalry troop was ordered to dismount and send their )Tj
T*(horses back to Texas. The unit, now on foot, traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, )Tj
T*(arriving two weeks after the Battle of Shiloh.[41] Ross soon caught a bad cold )Tj
T*(accompanied by a lingering fever, and was extremely ill for eightÂ weeks. By the )Tj
T*(time he considered himself cured, his weight had dwindled to only 125Â lb \(57Â )Tj
T*(kg\).[42] )Tj
T*( Over Ross's protests, the men of the Sixth Regiment elected him colonel in )Tj
T*(1862. He did not want the responsibility of the position and had not wanted to )Tj
T*(embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles )Tj
T*(W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed )Tj
T*(other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862 he was nominated )Tj
T*(for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, )Tj

T*(Under Ross's command, his Texans twice captured Union guns at Battery Robinett. )Tj
T*(They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements )Tj
T*(failed to arrive. During the battle, Ross, who had acquired a horse, was bucked )Tj
T*(off, leading his men to believe he had been killed. He was actually )Tj
T*(unharmed.[44] The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found )Tj
T*(themselves facing more Union troops at Hatchie's Bridge. Ross led 700Â riflemen )Tj
T*(to engage the Union troops. For threeÂ hours, his men held off 7,000Â Union )Tj
T*(troops, repulsing three major enemy assaults.[45] )Tj
T*( The Sixth Cavalry's horses arrived soon after the battle, and the regiment was )Tj
T*(transferred to the cavalry brigade of Colonel William H. "Red" Jackson. Ross )Tj
T*(was permitted to take a few weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife, and )Tj
T*(returned to his regiment in mid-January 1863.[46] Several months later, his )Tj
T*(unit participated in the Battle of Thompson's Station.[47] In July, Major )Tj
T*(General Stephen D. Lee joined the Sixth Texas Cavalry with Colonel R.A. )Tj
T*(Pinson's First Mississippi Cavalry, creating a new brigade with Ross at the )Tj
T*(helm. Near the same time, Ross received word that his first child had died, )Tj
T*(possibly stillborn.[48] )Tj
T*( Ross fell ill again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, )Tj
T*(he suffered recurring attacks of fever and chills every threeÂ days, symptomatic )Tj
T*(of tertian malaria.[18][49] Despite his illness, Ross never missed a day of )Tj
T*(duty, and in early 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the )Tj
T*(ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army.[18][50] Following his )Tj
T*(promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.[51][52] )Tj
T*( In March 1864, Ross's brigade fought against African American soldiers for the )Tj
T*(first time at Yazoo City, Mississippi. After bitter fighting, the Confederates )Tj
T*(were victorious. During the surrender negotiations, the Union officer accused )Tj
T*(the Texans of murdering several captured African American soldiers. Ross )Tj
T*(claimed that two of his men had likewise been killed after surrendering to )Tj
T*(Union troops.[53] )Tj
T*( Beginning in May, the brigade endured 112Â consecutive days of skirmishes, )Tj
T*(comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy. Though most of the skirmishes )Tj
T*(were small, by the end of the period injuries and desertion had cut the )Tj
T*(regiment's strength by 25%.[51][53] Ross was captured in late July at the )Tj
T*(Battle of Brown's Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate )Tj
T*(cavalry counterattack.[53] )Tj
T*( Their last major military campaign was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of )Tj
T*(November and December 1864. Ross and his men led the Confederate advance into )Tj
T*(Tennessee. Between the beginning of November and December 27, his men captured )Tj
T*(550Â prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough overcoats and blankets to )Tj
T*(survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70Â wounded )Tj
T*(and 5Â captured.[54] )Tj
T*( [edit] Surrender )Tj
T*( By the time Ross began a 90-day furlough on March 13, 1865, he had )Tj
T*(participated in 135Â engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot out )Tj
T*(from under him fiveÂ times, yet he had escaped serious injury.[55] With his )Tj
T*(leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in )Tj
T*(twoÂ years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not )Tj
T*(rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi on May 14, )Tj
T*(1865.[56] Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a )Tj
T*(parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank )Tj
T*(of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson's amnesty )Tj
T*(proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his )Tj
T*(property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason )Tj
T*(against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on )Tj

T*( Reconstruction did not harm Ross's fortune, and with hard work he soon )Tj
T*(prospered. Shortly after the war ended, he bought 20 acres \(8.1Â ha\) of land in )Tj
T*(town from his parents for $1,500. By May 1869 he had purchased an additional 40 )Tj
T*(acres \(16Â ha\) of farmland for $400, and the following year his wife inherited )Tj
T*(186 acres \(75Â ha\) of farmland from the estate of her father. Ross continued to )Tj
T*(buy land, and by the end of 1875 he owned over 1,000 acres \(400Â ha\) of )Tj
T*(farmland.[60] Besides farming, Ross and his brother Peter also raised Shorthorn )Tj
T*(cattle. The two led several trail drives to New Orleans. The combined farming )Tj
T*(and ranching incomes left Ross wealthy enough to build a house in the Waco city )Tj

T*(years they had arrested over 700Â outlaws.[63] In 1874, Ross helped establish )Tj
T*(the Sheriff's Association of Texas. After various state newspapers publicized )Tj
T*(the event, sheriffs representing 65 Texas counties met in Corsicana in August )Tj
T*(1874.[64] Ross became one of a committee of three assigned to draft resolutions )Tj
T*(for the convention. They asked for greater pay for sheriffs in certain )Tj

T*(the state capital, he was assigned to the committees for Educational Affairs, )Tj
T*(Internal Improvements, Finance, Penitentiaries, Military Affairs \(where he )Tj
T*(served as chairman\), State Affairs, Contingent Expenses, Stock and Stock )Tj
T*(Raising, Agricultural Affairs, and Enrolled Bills.[69] Ross introduced a )Tj
T*(petition on behalf of 500Â citizens of McLennan County, requesting that a )Tj
T*(prohibition amendment be placed on the next statewide ballot; the legislature )Tj
T*(did agree to place this on the next ballot.[70] )Tj
T*( Although the Texas Legislature typically meets once every twoÂ years, a fire )Tj
T*(destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881 and Ross was called to )Tj
T*(serve in a special session in April 1882. The session agreed to build a new )Tj
T*(capitol building.[71] Near the end of the special session, the Senate passed a )Tj
T*(reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only twoÂ years. He )Tj
T*(declined to run again.[72] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governor )Tj
T*( [edit] Election )Tj
T*( As early as 1884, Ross's friends, including Victor M. Rose, the editor of the )Tj
T*(newspaper in Victoria, had encouraged Ross to run for governor. He declined and )Tj
T*(asked his friend George Clark to attend the 1884 state Democratic convention to )Tj
T*(prevent Ross from being named the gubernatorial candidate. Clark had to produce )Tj
T*(written authorization from Ross to convince the delegates to nominate someone )Tj
T*(else.[73] Ross changed his mind in late 1885, announcing his candidacy for )Tj
T*(governor on February 25, 1886.[74] During the campaign he was variously accused )Tj
T*(of pandering to the Greenbackers, the Republicans, and the Knights.[75] Ross )Tj
T*(spent no money on his campaign other than traveling expenses but still handily )Tj
T*(won the Democratic nomination.[76] He won the general election with 228,776Â )Tj
T*(votes, compared with 65,236 for the Republican candidate and 19,186 from the )Tj
T*(Prohibitionist candidate.[77][78] Much of his support came from Confederate )Tj
T*(veterans.[78] )Tj
T*( Ross became the 19th governor of Texas.[79] His inauguration ball was held at )Tj
T*(the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas )Tj
T*(governor.[78] Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the )Tj
T*(governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the )Tj
T*(legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, )Tj
T*(to grant pardons, and to veto bills.[79] His campaign had focused on land use )Tj
T*(reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the )Tj
T*(use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with )Tj
T*(water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging the legislature passed laws )Tj
T*(to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for )Tj
T*(those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.[80] )Tj
T*( [edit] Second term )Tj
T*( In May 1888, Ross presided over the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol )Tj
T*(building.[81] Later that year, Ross ran relatively unopposed for a second )Tj
T*(term.[82] His platform included abolishing the national banking system, )Tj
T*(regulating monopolies, reducing tariffs, and allowing the railroads to regulate )Tj
T*(themselves through competition.[75] No other Democrats placed their names in )Tj
T*(contention at the nominating convention, and the Republicans chose not to )Tj
T*(select a candidate, as they were happy with Ross's performance. His sole )Tj
T*(competition was a Prohibitionist whom Ross defeated by over 151,000Â votes.[82] )Tj
T*(In his second inaugural address, Ross, a true Jeffersonian Democrat,[75] )Tj
T*(maintained that "'a plain, simple government, with severe limitations upon )Tj

T*( During his second term, Ross was forced to intervene in the Jaybird-Woodpecker )Tj
T*(War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared that there would be armed )Tj
T*(battles between the white supremacist Democrats \(the Jaybirds\) and the black )Tj
T*(men who had retained political power \(who, with their white supporters, were )Tj
T*(known as Woodpeckers\). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, )Tj
T*(which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four )Tj
T*(Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence )Tj
T*(erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten )Tj
T*(wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and )Tj
T*(instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney )Tj
T*(General and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials )Tj
T*(and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the )Tj
T*(two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, )Tj
T*(who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, )Tj
T*(Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the )Tj
T*(conflict.[84][85] )Tj
T*( In March 1890, the U.S. Attorney General launched a suit in the Supreme Court )Tj
T*(against Texas to determine ownership of a disputed 1,500,000-acre \(6,100Â km2\) )Tj
T*(plot of land in Greer County.[86] Determined to meet personally with the )Tj
T*(Attorney General, Ross and his wife traveled to Washington, D.C., where they )Tj
T*(visited President Benjamin Harrison at the White House. Following that visit, )Tj
T*(they traveled to New York, where they met with former president Grover )Tj
T*(Cleveland. While in New York, Ross was extremely popular with journalists. He )Tj
T*(was interviewed by several large northeastern newspapers, which recounted in )Tj
T*(detail many of his exploits along the frontier. According to his biographer )Tj
T*(Judith Brenner, the trip and the resulting exposure for Ross, "excited much )Tj
T*(interest in Texas among easterners, an interest that would eventually bear )Tj
T*(fruit in increased investment, tourism, and immigration".[87] )Tj
T*( Ross declined to become the first Texas governor to run for a third term and )Tj
T*(left office on January 20, 1891.[88][89] During his four years in office, he )Tj
T*(vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861Â people.[90] Compared to other Texas )Tj
T*(governors, these are small numbers; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161Â )Tj
T*(pardons in just twoÂ years.[91] )Tj
T*( [edit] Major legislation )Tj
T*( During his time in office Ross proposed tax reform laws intended to provide )Tj
T*(for more equitable assessments of propertyâ€”at that time people were allowed to )Tj
T*(assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his )Tj
T*(recommendations,[92] and approved his plan to exert more control over school )Tj
T*(funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools.[93] He also )Tj
T*(encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, )Tj
T*(1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust )Tj
T*(Act.[94] His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become )Tj
T*(the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature to deal )Tj
T*(with a treasury surplus.[81] )Tj
T*( During his term, the legislature agreed to allow the public to vote on a state )Tj
T*(constitutional amendment for the prohibition of alcohol. Ross vehemently )Tj
T*(opposed the measure, saying "'No government ever succeeded in changing the )Tj
T*(moral convictions of its subjects by force.'"[95] The amendment was defeated by )Tj
T*(over 90,000Â votes.[95] )Tj
T*( When Ross took the governor's oath of office, Texas had only four charitable )Tj
T*(institutionsâ€”two insane asylums, an institute for the blind, and an institute )Tj
T*(for the deaf and dumb. By the time he left office, Ross had supervised the )Tj
T*(opening of a state orphan's home, a state institute for deaf, dumb, and blind )Tj
T*(black children, and a branch asylum for the insane.[93] He also convinced the )Tj
T*(legislature to set aside 696 acres \(2.82Â km2\) near Gatesville for a future open )Tj
T*(farm reformatory for juvenile offenders.[96] )Tj
T*( Ross was the first governor to set aside a day for civic improvements, )Tj
T*(declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren )Tj

T*(efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of )Tj
T*(each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the )Tj
T*(Texas State Capitol.[98] )Tj
T*( Ross felt strongly that the state should adequately care for its veterans. )Tj
T*(During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in )Tj
T*(Austin. Within twoÂ years, the facility had run out of room, so Ross served as )Tj
T*(chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August )Tj
T*(1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.[99] )Tj
T*( Samuel Willis Tucker Lanham was the last governor of Texas that also served as )Tj
T*(a Confederate soldier in the Civil War, January 20, 1903 to January 15, )Tj
T*(1907.[100] )Tj
T*( [edit] College president )Tj
T*( [edit] Arrival )Tj
T*( By the late 1880s, rumors abounded of "poor management, student discontent, )Tj
T*(professorial dissatisfaction, faculty factionalism, disciplinary problems, and )Tj
T*(campus scandals" at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas \(now Texas )Tj
T*(A&amp;M University\).[101] The public was skeptical of the idea of scientific )Tj
T*(agriculture[102] and the legislature declined to appropriate money for )Tj
T*(improvements to the campus because it had little confidence in the school's )Tj
T*(administrators. The board of directors decided that the school, known as Texas )Tj
T*(AMC, needed to be run by an independent administrative chief rather than the )Tj
T*(faculty chairman. On July 1, 1890, the board unanimously agreed to offer the )Tj
T*(new job to the sitting governor and asked Ross to resign his office )Tj
T*(immediately.[102][103] Ross agreed to consider the offer as well as several )Tj
T*(others he had received. An unknown person informed several newspapers that Ross )Tj
T*(had been asked to become Texas AMC's president, and each of the newspapers )Tj
T*(editorialized that Ross would be a perfect fit. The college had been founded to )Tj
T*(teach military and agricultural knowledge, and Ross had demonstrated excellence )Tj
T*(in the army and as a farmer. His gubernatorial service had honed his )Tj
T*(administrative skills, and he had always expressed an interest in )Tj
T*(education.[102][104] )Tj
T*( Though Ross was concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as )Tj
T*(he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced )Tj
T*(that he would accept the position.[105] As the news of his acceptance spread )Tj
T*(throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the )Tj
T*(men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under )Tj
T*(their former commander, and 500Â students attempted to enroll at the beginning )Tj
T*(of the 1890â€“1891 school year. Three hundred sixteen students were admitted, )Tj
T*(even though the facilities were only designed for 250Â scholars. When Ross )Tj
T*(officially took charge of the school on February 2,[106] the campus had no )Tj
T*(running water, faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and )Tj
T*(many students were running wild.[107] )Tj
T*( [edit] Improvements )Tj
T*( The board of directors named Ross the treasurer of the school, and he posted a )Tj
T*($20,000Â personal bond "'for the faithful performance of his duty'".[108] In the )Tj
T*(break between school years Ross instituted a number of changes. When students )Tj
T*(returned for the 1891â€“1892 school year, they found a new 3-story dormitory with )Tj
T*(41Â rooms \(named Ross Hall\), the beginning of construction on a new home for the )Tj
T*(president, and a new building to house the machine and blacksmith shops. The )Tj
T*(minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15, and Ross now personally )Tj
T*(interviewed all prospective students to determine if they should be admitted. )Tj
T*(Fees and expenses rose by $10 per session, and the number of hours required for )Tj
T*(graduation increased, including additional hours in English grammar, sciences, )Tj
T*(mathematics, and history. Additionally, Ross would now appoint the officers for )Tj
T*(the Corps of Cadets, and the name of the company of best-drilled cadets in the )Tj
T*(Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers \(from Scott Volunteers\). Finally, )Tj
T*(Ross enacted an official prohibition against hazing, vowing to expel any )Tj
T*(student found guilty of the practice.[109] Although Ross professed to enjoy his )Tj
T*(new position, he wrote to several people that directing the college "'made me )Tj
T*(turn gray very fast.'"[109] )Tj

T*( Enrollment continued to rise, and by the end of his tenure, Ross requested )Tj
T*(that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the )Tj
T*(school.[110] The increase in students necessitated an improvement in )Tj
T*(facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898 the college spent over )Tj
T*($97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess )Tj
T*(hall, which could seat 500Â diners at once, an infirmary, which included the )Tj
T*(first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty )Tj
T*(residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage )Tj
T*(room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery )Tj
T*(shed.[111][112] Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury )Tj
T*(held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus )Tj
T*(to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured that the money was returned to the )Tj
T*(students in the form of lower fees.[111][112] )Tj
T*( [edit] Impact on students )Tj
T*( Ross made himself accessible to students and participated in school activities )Tj
T*(whenever possible. Those around him found him "slow to condemn but ready to )Tj
T*(encourage ... [and they] could not recall hearing Ross use profanity or seeing )Tj
T*(him visibly angry."[113] Every month he prepared grade sheets for each student )Tj
T*(and would often call poorly performing students into his office for a )Tj
T*(discussion of their difficulties.[112][114] Under his leadership, the military )Tj
T*(aspect of the college was emphasized. However, he eliminated many practices )Tj
T*(that he considered unnecessary, including marching to and from class, and he )Tj
T*(reduced the amount of guard time and the number of drills that students were )Tj
T*(expected to perform.[115] )Tj
T*( Although enrollment had always been limited to men, Ross favored coeducation, )Tj
T*(as he thought the male cadets "'would be improved by the elevating influence of )Tj
T*(the good girls'".[116] In 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of a Texas AMC )Tj
T*(professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped )Tj
T*(edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. )Tj
T*(Several years later, her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of )Tj
T*(1903, and slowly other daughters of professors were allowed to attend )Tj
T*(classes.[117] )Tj
T*( During Ross's seven and one-half year tenure, many enduring Texas A&amp;M )Tj
T*(traditions formed. These include the first Aggie Ring and the formation of the )Tj
T*(Aggie Band. Ross's tenure also saw the school's first intercollegiate football )Tj
T*(game, played against the University of Texas.[107] Many student organizations )Tj
T*(were founded in this time period, including the Fat Man's Club, the Bowlegged )Tj
T*(Men's Club, the Glee Club \(now known as the Singing Cadets\), the Bicycle Club, )Tj
T*(and the College Dramatic Club. In 1893, students began publishing a monthly )Tj
T*(newspaper, The Battalion, and twoÂ years later they began publishing an annual )Tj
T*(yearbook, known as The Olio.[112][118] )Tj
T*( [edit] Personal life and death )Tj
T*( Ross continued to be active in veteran's organizations, and in 1893 he became )Tj
T*(the first commander of the Texas Division of the United Confederate Veterans. )Tj
T*(He was re-elected president several times and served one term as )Tj
T*(commander-in-chief of the entire United Confederate Veterans organization. )Tj
T*(During that time, a Daughters of the Confederacy chapter was established in )Tj
T*(Bryan and named the L.S. Ross Chapter.[119][120] )Tj
T*( In 1894, Ross was appointed to a seat on the Railroad Commission of Texas. )Tj
T*(While Ross pondered whether to resign his position and accept the appointment, )Tj
T*(letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas )Tj
T*(AMC. He declined the appointment and remained president of the )Tj
T*(college.[120][121] )Tj
T*( Ross had always been an avid hunter, and he embarked on a hunting trip along )Tj
T*(the Navasota River with his son Neville and several family friends during )Tj
T*(Christmas vacation in 1897. While hunting he suffered acute indigestion and a )Tj
T*(severe chill and decided to go home early while the others continued their )Tj
T*(sport. He arrived in College Station on December 30 and consulted a doctor. )Tj
T*(Ross remained in pain for several days, and in the early evening of January 3, )Tj

T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( The morning after Ross's death, the Dallas Morning News published an )Tj
T*(editorial, quoted in several biographies of Ross: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(It has been the lot of few men to be of such great service to Texas as Sul )Tj
T*(Ross. ... Throughout his life he has been closely connected with the public )Tj
T*(welfare and ... discharged every duty imposed upon him with diligence, ability, )Tj
T*(honesty and patriotism. ... He was not a brilliant chieftain in the field, nor )Tj
T*(was he masterful in the art of politics, but, better than either, he was a )Tj
T*(well-balanced, well-rounded man from whatever standpoint one might estimate )Tj
T*(him. In his public relations he exhibited sterling common sense, lofty )Tj
T*(patriotism, inflexible honesty and withal a character so exalted that he )Tj
T*(commanded at all times not only the confidence but the affection of the people. )Tj
T*(... He leaves a name that will be honored as long as chivalry, devotion to duty )Tj
T*(and spotless integrity are standards of our civilization and an example which )Tj
T*(ought to be an inspiration to all young men of Texas who aspire to careers of )Tj
T*(public usefulness and honorable renown.[125][126])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Within weeks of Ross's death former cadets at Texas AMC began gathering funds )Tj
T*(for a monument. In 1917, the state appropriated $10,000 for the monument, and )Tj
T*(two years later a 10Â foot \(3Â m\) bronze statue of Ross, sculpted by Pompeo )Tj
T*(Coppini, was unveiled at the center of the Texas AMC campus.[126][127] In more )Tj
T*(recent years, students began the tradition of placing pennies at the feet of )Tj
T*(statue before exams for good luck. School legend states that Ross would often )Tj
T*(tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. At )Tj
T*(exam time his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in )Tj
T*(pennies.[128] )Tj
T*( At the same time they appropriated money for the statue, the legislature )Tj
T*(established the Sul Ross Normal College, now Sul Ross State University in )Tj

T*( The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient )Tj
T*(Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king )Tj
T*(of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris' murderer, his brother Set, usurps his )Tj
T*(throne. Meanwhile, Osiris' wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him )Tj
T*(to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on )Tj
T*(Horus, the product of Isis and Osiris' union, who is first a vulnerable child )Tj
T*(protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their )Tj
T*(often violent conflict ends with Horus' triumph, which restores order to Egypt )Tj
T*(after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris resurrection. )Tj
T*(The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions )Tj
T*(of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder and, )Tj
T*(especially, death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character )Tj
T*(of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship )Tj
T*(in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth. )Tj
T*( The Osiris myth reached its basic form in or before the 25th century BC. Many )Tj
T*(of its elements originated in religious ideas, but the conflict between Horus )Tj
T*(and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional struggle in Egypt's early )Tj
T*(history or prehistory. Scholars have tried to discern the exact nature of the )Tj
T*(events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive )Tj
T*(conclusions. )Tj
T*( Parts of the myth appear in a wide variety of Egyptian texts, from funerary )Tj
T*(texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more )Tj
T*(detailed and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no )Tj

T*(reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted )Tj
T*(after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well )Tj
T*(known today. )Tj
T*( [edit] Sources )Tj
T*( The myth of Osiris was very important in ancient Egyptian religion and was )Tj
T*(popular among ordinary people.[1] One reason for this popularity is the myth's )Tj
T*(primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a )Tj
T*(pleasant afterlife.[2] Another reason is that the characters and their emotions )Tj
T*(are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian )Tj
T*(myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace.[3] In )Tj
T*(particular, the myth conveys a "strong sense of family loyalty and devotion", )Tj
T*(as the Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths put it, in the relationships between )Tj
T*(Osiris, Isis, and Horus.[4] With this widespread appeal, the myth appears in )Tj
T*(more ancient texts than any other myth and in an exceptionally broad range of )Tj
T*(Egyptian literary styles.[1] These sources also provide an unusual amount of )Tj
T*(detail.[2] Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague, because the )Tj
T*(religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than )Tj
T*(coherent narration. The Osiris myth is fragmentary to some extent, and it too )Tj
T*(is rich in symbolism. But in comparison with other myths, it bears a greater )Tj
T*(resemblance to a cohesive story.[5] )Tj
T*( The earliest mentions of the Osiris myth are in the Pyramid Texts, the first )Tj
T*(Egyptian funerary texts, which appeared on the walls of burial chambers in )Tj
T*(pyramids at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, during the 25th century BC. These )Tj
T*(texts, made up of disparate spells or "utterances", contain ideas that are )Tj
T*(presumed to date from still earlier times.[6] The texts are concerned with the )Tj
T*(afterlife of the king buried in the pyramid, so they frequently refer to the )Tj
T*(Osiris myth, which is deeply involved with kingship and the afterlife.[7] Major )Tj
T*(elements of the story, such as the death and restoration of Osiris and the )Tj
T*(strife between Horus and Set, appear in the utterances of the Pyramid Texts.[8] )Tj
T*( The same elements from the myth that appear in the Pyramid Texts recur in )Tj
T*(funerary texts written in later times, such as the Coffin Texts from the Middle )Tj
T*(Kingdom \(c. 2055â€“1650 BC\) and the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom \(c. )Tj
T*(1550â€“1070 BC\). Most of these writings were made for the general populace, so )Tj
T*(the association made in these texts, between Osiris and the dead, is no longer )Tj
T*(restricted to royalty.[9] )Tj
T*( The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to )Tj
T*(Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty \(c. 1550â€“1292 BC\) that gives )Tj
T*(the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail.[10] Another )Tj
T*(important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes )Tj
T*(an account of Osiris' death as well as the resolution of the dispute between )Tj
T*(Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus )Tj
T*(represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis.[11] The text was long )Tj
T*(thought to date back to the Old Kingdom \(c. 2686â€“2181 BC\) and was treated as a )Tj
T*(source for information about the early stages in the development of the myth. )Tj
T*(Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates from )Tj
T*(the New Kingdom at the earliest.[12] )Tj
T*( Texts related to Osirian rituals come from the walls of Egyptian temples that )Tj
T*(date from the New Kingdom to the Ptolemaic era of 323â€“30 BC. Such ritual texts )Tj
T*(are another major source of information about the myth.[13] )Tj
T*( Magical healing spells, which were used by Egyptians of all classes, are the )Tj
T*(source for an important portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or )Tj
T*(otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with )Tj
T*(Horus so that he or she can benefit from the goddess' efforts. The spells are )Tj
T*(known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and )Tj
T*(from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People )Tj
T*(seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to )Tj
T*(imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank )Tj
T*(the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child )Tj
T*(protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle )Tj
T*(Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that )Tj

T*(specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.[14] )Tj
T*( Episodes from the myth were also recorded in writings intended as )Tj
T*(entertainment. Prominent among these texts is "The Contendings of Horus and )Tj
T*(Set", a humorous retelling of several episodes of the struggle between the two )Tj
T*(deities, which dates to the Twentieth Dynasty \(c. 1190â€“1070 BC\).[15] It vividly )Tj
T*(characterizes the deities involved; as the Egyptologist Donald B. Redford says, )Tj
T*("Horus appears as a physically weak but clever Puck-like figure, Seth [Set] as )Tj
T*(a strong-man buffoon of limited intelligence, Re-Horakhty [Ra] as a prejudiced, )Tj
T*(sulky judge, and Osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue."[16] )Tj
T*(Despite its atypical nature, "Contendings" includes many of the oldest episodes )Tj
T*(in the divine conflict, and many events appear in the same order as in much )Tj
T*(later accounts, suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming at )Tj
T*(the time that the story was written.[17] )Tj
T*( Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who described Egyptian religion late in its )Tj
T*(history, recorded much of the Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BC, )Tj
T*(mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and )Tj
T*(four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided a summary of the myth in his )Tj
T*(Bibliotheca historica.[18] In the early 2nd century AD,[19]Plutarch wrote the )Tj
T*(most complete ancient account of the myth in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis )Tj
T*(of Egyptian religious beliefs.[20] Plutarch's account of the myth is the )Tj
T*(version that modern popular writings most frequently retell.[21] The writings )Tj
T*(of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs.[20] )Tj
T*(For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of Egyptian )Tj
T*(belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of )Tj
T*(the myth contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. )Tj
T*(Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek )Tj
T*(mythology, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on Egyptian )Tj
T*(sources.[22] His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples )Tj
T*(may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that )Tj
T*(Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Synopsis )Tj
T*( [edit] Death and resurrection of Osiris )Tj
T*( At the start of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having inherited the kingship )Tj
T*(from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra )Tj
T*(or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer Set, is one )Tj
T*(of the children of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little )Tj
T*(information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is )Tj
T*(on his death and the events that follow.[24] Osiris is connected with )Tj
T*(life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of maat, the ideal natural )Tj
T*(order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture.[25] )Tj
T*(Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of )Tj
T*(Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order and disorder, and the disruption )Tj
T*(of life by death.[26] )Tj
T*( Some versions of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According )Tj
T*(to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave )Tj
T*(him,[27] whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex )Tj
T*(with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut.[2] The )Tj
T*(murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The )Tj
T*(Egyptians believed that written words had the power to affect reality, so they )Tj
T*(avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris' )Tj
T*(death.[28] Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of )Tj
T*(the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered.[29] In some )Tj
T*(cases the texts suggest that Set takes the form of a wild animal, such as a )Tj
T*(crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris' corpse is )Tj
T*(thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin )Tj
T*(of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred.[30] )Tj
T*(Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the )Tj
T*(god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged )Tj
T*(by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris' son by Isis.[31] )Tj

T*(Osiris' body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of )Tj
T*(Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of )Tj
T*(it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many )Tj
T*(as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or )Tj
T*(provinces, in Egypt.[32] Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of )Tj
T*(his kingdom.[30] )Tj
T*( Osiris' death is followed either by an interregnum or by a period in which Set )Tj
T*(assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband's body with the )Tj
T*(aid of Nephthys.[34] When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses )Tj
T*(are often likened to falcons or kites,[35] possibly because kites travel far in )Tj
T*(search of carrion,[36] because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls )Tj
T*(with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses' connection with Horus, who is )Tj
T*(often represented as a falcon.[35] In the New Kingdom, when Osiris' death and )Tj
T*(renewal came to be associated with the annual flooding of the Nile that )Tj
T*(fertilized Egypt, the waters of the Nile were equated with Isis' tears of )Tj
T*(mourning,[37] or with Osiris' bodily fluids.[38] Osiris thus represented the )Tj
T*(life-giving divine power that was present in the river's water and in the )Tj
T*(plants that grew after the flood.[39] )Tj
T*( The goddesses find and restore Osiris' body, often with the help of other )Tj
T*(deities, including Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing )Tj
T*(powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Their efforts are )Tj
T*(the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which, by mummifying )Tj
T*(the body, sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part )Tj
T*(of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try )Tj
T*(to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is )Tj
T*(made whole, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into his body with )Tj
T*(her wings and copulates with him.[34] Osiris' revival is apparently not )Tj
T*(permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler )Tj
T*(of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Yet in his brief )Tj
T*(contact with Isis, he has conceived his son and rightful heir, Horus. Although )Tj
T*(Osiris himself lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for )Tj
T*(will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.[40] )Tj
T*( The cohesive account by Plutarch, which deals mainly with this portion of the )Tj
T*(myth, differs in many respects from the known Egyptian sources. Setâ€”whom )Tj
T*(Plutarch, using Greek names for many of the Egyptian deities, refers to as )Tj
T*("Typhon"â€”conspires against Osiris with seventy-three other people. Set has an )Tj
T*(elaborate chest made to fit Osiris' exact measurements and then, at a banquet, )Tj
T*(declares that he will give the chest as a gift to whoever fits inside it. The )Tj
T*(guests, in turn, lie inside the coffin, but none fit inside except Osiris. When )Tj
T*(he lies down in the chest, Set and his accomplices slam the cover shut, seal )Tj
T*(it, and throw it into the Nile. With Osiris' corpse inside, the chest floats )Tj
T*(out into the sea, arriving at the city of Byblos, where a tree grows around it. )Tj
T*(The king of Byblos has the tree cut down and made into a pillar for his palace, )Tj
T*(still with the chest inside. Isis must remove the chest from within the tree in )Tj
T*(order to retrieve her husband's body. Having taken the chest, she leaves the )Tj
T*(tree in Byblos, where it becomes an object of worship for the locals. This )Tj
T*(episode, which is not known from Egyptian sources, gives an etiological )Tj
T*(explanation for a cult of Isis and Osiris that existed in Byblos in Plutarch's )Tj
T*(time and possibly as early as the New Kingdom.[41] )Tj
T*( Plutarch also states that Set steals and dismembers the corpse only after Isis )Tj
T*(has retrieved it. Isis then finds and buries each piece of her husband's body, )Tj
T*(with the exception of the penis, which she has to reconstruct with magic, )Tj
T*(because the original was eaten by fish in the river. According to Plutarch, )Tj
T*(this is the reason the Egyptians had a taboo against eating fish. In Egyptian )Tj
T*(accounts, however, the penis of Osiris is found intact, and the only close )Tj
T*(parallel with this part of Plutarch's story is in "The Tale of Two Brothers", a )Tj
T*(folk tale from the New Kingdom with similarities to the Osiris myth.[42] )Tj
T*( A final difference in Plutarch's account is Horus' birth. The form of Horus )Tj
T*(that avenges his father has been conceived and born before Osiris' death. It is )Tj
T*(a premature and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris' )Tj

T*(minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus )Tj
T*(and raises him, and hence it is also called the "nest of Horus".[34] The image )Tj
T*(of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in Egyptian art.[44] )Tj
T*( There are texts in which Isis travels in the wider world. She moves among )Tj
T*(ordinary humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these )Tj
T*(people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, )Tj
T*(gods and humans are normally separate.[47] As in the first phase of the myth, )Tj
T*(she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence.[34] )Tj
T*(According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and )Tj
T*(guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy )Tj
T*(woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it )Tj
T*(necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child.[47] This story conveys a moral )Tj
T*(message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates )Tj
T*(Isis' fair and compassionate nature.[48] )Tj
T*( In this stage of the myth, Horus is a vulnerable child beset by dangers. The )Tj
T*(magical texts that use Horus' childhood as the basis for their healing spells )Tj
T*(give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches,[49] )Tj
T*(adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to )Tj
T*(treat.[50] Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting )Tj
T*(the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison.[34] Some texts )Tj
T*(indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set.[51] Isis may use her )Tj
T*(own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities )Tj
T*(such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in )Tj
T*(the first portion of the story, so during Horus' childhood she is the ideal )Tj
T*(devoted mother.[52] Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her )Tj
T*(son are extended to cure any patient.[46] )Tj
T*( [edit] Conflict of Horus and Set )Tj
T*( The next phase of the myth begins when the adult Horus challenges Set for the )Tj
T*(throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also )Tj
T*(described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian )Tj
T*(deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may )Tj
T*(be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, )Tj
T*(or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship.[53] )Tj
T*(Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator )Tj
T*(in the dispute[54] or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in )Tj
T*("Contendings", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.[55] )Tj
T*( The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both )Tj
T*(perspectives appear as early as the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source of the )Tj
T*(myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of )Tj
T*(Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other )Tj
T*(tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers.[56] This incongruity persists in )Tj
T*(many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or )Tj
T*(uncle and nephew at different points in the same document.[57] )Tj
T*( The divine struggle involves many episodes. "Contendings" describes the two )Tj
T*(gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing )Tj
T*(in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other )Tj
T*(in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus )Tj
T*(repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities.[58] Yet )Tj

T*(the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator )Tj
T*(god, favors Set.[59] In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a )Tj
T*(great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers.[60] The strife in )Tj
T*(the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts )Tj
T*(to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus )Tj
T*(instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage.[61] Thoth replaces Isis' )Tj
T*(head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn )Tj
T*(headdress that Isis commonly wears.[62] In some sources, Set justifies further )Tj
T*(attacks on Horus as punishment for the young god's violence against his )Tj
T*(mother.[63] )Tj
T*( In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation )Tj
T*(is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, )Tj
T*(in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and )Tj
T*(indiscriminate sexuality.[64] In the earliest account of this episode, in a )Tj
T*(fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks )Tj
T*(to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus )Tj
T*(some of his strength.[65] The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in )Tj
T*(Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. )Tj
T*(According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus' body and makes him ill, but )Tj
T*(in "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis )Tj
T*(retaliates by putting Horus' semen on lettuces that Set eats. Set's defeat )Tj
T*(becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He )Tj
T*(has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result "gives birth" to the )Tj
T*(disk. In "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in )Tj
T*(earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.[66] )Tj
T*( Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict )Tj
T*(upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or )Tj
T*(tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus' eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn )Tj
T*(into pieces.[67] Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and )Tj
T*(strength.[68] The removal of Horus' eye is even more important, for this stolen )Tj
T*(Eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of )Tj
T*(Horus' major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was )Tj
T*(said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the )Tj
T*(Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course )Tj
T*(of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back the lost eye, )Tj
T*(or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it )Tj
T*(for him.[67] The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about )Tj
T*(the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and )Tj
T*(that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is )Tj
T*(the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form )Tj
T*(a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus )Tj
T*(retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus' Eye )Tj
T*(when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his )Tj
T*(other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to )Tj
T*(emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding )Tj
T*(deities.[69] )Tj
T*( In any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the )Tj
T*(return of the moon to full brightness,[70] the return of the kingship to )Tj
T*(Horus,[71] and many other aspects of maat.[72] Sometimes the restoration of )Tj
T*(Horus' eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both )Tj
T*(gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.[73] )Tj
T*( [edit] Resolution )Tj
T*( As with so many other parts of the myth, the resolution is complex and varied. )Tj
T*(Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be )Tj
T*(equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in )Tj
T*(their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of )Tj
T*(Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign )Tj
T*(lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in )Tj
T*(the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the )Tj
T*(country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with )Tj

T*(either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions )Tj
T*(the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole )Tj
T*(control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and )Tj
T*(the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. )Tj
T*(Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.[74] )Tj
T*( A different view of the myth's end focuses on Horus' sole triumph.[75] In this )Tj
T*(version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated,[76] and )Tj
T*(sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed.[77] His defeat and )Tj
T*(humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian )Tj
T*(history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the )Tj
T*(Egyptians no longer saw him as an integral part of natural order.[76] )Tj
T*( With great celebration among the gods, Horus takes the throne, and Egypt at )Tj
T*(last has a rightful king.[78] The divine decision that Set is in the wrong )Tj
T*(corrects the injustice created by Osiris' murder and completes the process of )Tj
T*(his restoration after death.[79] Sometimes Set is made to carry Osiris' body to )Tj
T*(its tomb as part of his punishment.[80] The new king performs funerary rites )Tj
T*(for his father and gives food offerings to sustain himâ€”often including the Eye )Tj
T*(of Horus, which in this instance represents life and plenty.[81] According to )Tj
T*(some sources, only through these acts can Osiris be fully enlivened in the )Tj
T*(afterlife and take his place as king of the dead, paralleling his son's role as )Tj
T*(king of the living. Thereafter, Osiris is deeply involved with natural cycles )Tj
T*(of death and renewal, such as the annual growth of crops, that parallel his own )Tj
T*(resurrection.[82] )Tj
T*( [edit] Origins )Tj
T*( As the Osiris myth first appears in the Pyramid Texts, most of its essential )Tj
T*(features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written. The )Tj
T*(distinct segments of the storyâ€”Osiris' death and restoration, Horus' childhood, )Tj
T*(and Horus' conflict with Setâ€”may originally have been independent mythic )Tj
T*(episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story by the )Tj
T*(time of the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, )Tj
T*(the myth was inspired by a variety of influences.[3] Much of the story is based )Tj
T*(in religious ideas[83] and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine )Tj
T*(nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another,[84] the struggle )Tj
T*(to maintain maat,[85] and the effort to overcome death.[3] For instance, Isis )Tj
T*(and Nephthys' lamentations for their dead brother may represent an early )Tj
T*(tradition of ritualized mourning.[86] )Tj
T*( There are, however, important points of disagreement. The origins of Osiris )Tj
T*(are much debated,[38] and the basis for the myth of his death is also somewhat )Tj
T*(uncertain.[87] One influential hypothesis was given by the anthropologist James )Tj
T*(Frazer, who in 1906 said that Osiris, like other "dying and rising gods" across )Tj
T*(the ancient Near East, began as a personification of vegetation. His death and )Tj
T*(restoration, therefore, were based on the yearly death and re-growth of )Tj
T*(plants.[88] Many Egyptologists adopted this explanation. But in the late 20th )Tj
T*(century, J. Gwyn Griffiths, who extensively studied Osiris and his mythology, )Tj
T*(argued that Osiris originated as a divine ruler of the dead, and his connection )Tj
T*(with vegetation was a secondary development.[89] Meanwhile, scholars of )Tj
T*(comparative religion have increasingly criticized Frazer's overarching concept )Tj
T*(of "dying and rising gods".[88] More recently, the Egyptologist Rosalie David )Tj
T*(maintains that Osiris originally "personified the annual rebirth of the trees )Tj
T*(and plants after the [Nile] inundation."[90] )Tj
T*( Another continuing debate concerns the opposition of Horus and Set, which )Tj
T*(Egyptologists have often tried to connect with political events early in )Tj
T*(Egypt's history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the )Tj
T*(kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the )Tj
T*(union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some )Tj
T*(kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological )Tj
T*(evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an )Tj
T*(Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The )Tj
T*(Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves "followers of Horus", and Horus became )Tj
T*(the patron god of the unified nation and its kings. Yet Horus and Set cannot be )Tj

T*(easily equated with the two halves of the country. Both deities had several )Tj
T*(cult centers in each region, and Horus is often associated with Lower Egypt and )Tj
T*(Set with Upper Egypt.[31] One of the better-known explanations for these )Tj
T*(discrepancies was proposed by Kurt Sethe in 1930. He argued that Osiris was )Tj
T*(originally the human ruler of a unified Egypt in prehistoric times, before a )Tj
T*(rebellion of Upper Egyptian Set-worshippers. The Lower Egyptian followers of )Tj
T*(Horus then forcibly reunified the land, inspiring the myth of Horus' triumph, )Tj
T*(before Upper Egypt, now led by Horus worshippers, became prominent again at the )Tj
T*(start of the Early Dynastic Period.[91] )Tj
T*( In the late 20th century, Griffiths focused on the inconsistent portrayal of )Tj
T*(Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, in the early )Tj
T*(stages of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings )Tj
T*(and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories )Tj
T*(were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the )Tj
T*(Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the )Tj
T*(characterization of the Horusâ€“Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the )Tj
T*(son and heir avenging Osiris' death. Traces of the independent traditions )Tj
T*(remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship )Tj
T*(and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the )Tj
T*(goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths )Tj
T*(therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris' murder was rooted in historical )Tj
T*(events.[92] This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as )Tj
T*(Jan Assmann[57] and George Hart.[93] )Tj
T*( Griffiths sought a historical origin for the Horusâ€“Set rivalry, and he posited )Tj
T*(two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to )Tj
T*(Sethe's theory, to account for it.[94] Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly )Tj
T*(because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture )Tj
T*(further.[95] Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major )Tj
T*(cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The )Tj
T*(rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to )Tj
T*(have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was )Tj
T*(associated with Naqada, so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly )Tj
T*(reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the )Tj
T*(end of the Second Dynasty \(c. 2890â€“2686 BC\), King Peribsen used the Set animal )Tj
T*(in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph )Tj
T*(representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the )Tj
T*(writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second )Tj
T*(Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers )Tj
T*(of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then )Tj
T*(represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the )Tj
T*(myth.[31] )Tj
T*( Noting the uncertainties surrounding events so far back in time, Herman te )Tj
T*(Velde argues that the historical roots of the conflict are too obscure to be )Tj
T*(very useful in understanding the myth and are not as significant as its )Tj
T*(religious meaning. He says that "the origin of the myth of Horus and Seth is )Tj
T*(lost in the mists of the religious traditions of prehistory."[83] )Tj
T*( [edit] Influence )Tj
T*( The effect of the Osiris myth on Egyptian culture was greater and more )Tj
T*(widespread than that of any other myth.[1] In literature, the myth was not only )Tj
T*(the basis for a retelling such as "Contendings"; it also provided the basis for )Tj
T*(more distantly related stories. "The Tale of Two Brothers", a folk tale with )Tj
T*(human protagonists, includes elements similar to the myth of Osiris.[96] One )Tj
T*(character's penis is eaten by a fish, and he later dies and is resurrected.[97] )Tj
T*(Another story, "The Tale of Truth and Falsehood", adapts the conflict of Horus )Tj
T*(and Set into an allegory, in which the characters are direct personifications )Tj
T*(of truth and lies rather than deities associated with those concepts.[96] )Tj
T*( From at least the time of the Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their )Tj
T*(deaths they could emulate Osiris' restoration to life and his rule over the )Tj
T*(realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom \(c. 2055â€“1650 BC\), non-royal )Tj
T*(Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by )Tj

T*(worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his )Tj
T*(myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity.[99] The myth )Tj
T*(also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only )Tj
T*(virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged )Tj
T*(Osiris and Horus to be righteous, undoing the injustice of Osiris' death, so a )Tj
T*(deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be )Tj
T*(undone.[79] As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, )Tj
T*(Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to )Tj
T*(those who followed his example.[100] )Tj
T*( As the importance of Osiris grew, so did his popularity. By late in the Middle )Tj
T*(Kingdom, the centuries-old tomb of the First Dynasty ruler Djer, near Osiris' )Tj
T*(main center of worship in the city of Abydos, was seen as Osiris' tomb. )Tj
T*(Accordingly, it became a major focus of Osiris worship. For the next 1,500 )Tj
T*(years, an annual festival procession traveled from Osiris' main temple to the )Tj
T*(tomb site. This procession made reference to, and may have ritually reenacted, )Tj
T*(Isis and Nephthys' mourning, restoration, and revival of their murdered )Tj
T*(brother.[101] Kings and commoners from across Egypt built chapels, which served )Tj
T*(as cenotaphs, near the processional route. In doing so they sought to )Tj
T*(strengthen their connection with Osiris in the afterlife.[102] Another major )Tj
T*(funerary festival, a national event spread over several days in the month of )Tj
T*(Khoiak in the Egyptian calendar, became linked with Osiris during the Middle )Tj
T*(Kingdom.[103] During Khoiak the djed pillar, an emblem of Osiris, was ritually )Tj
T*(raised into an upright position, symbolizing Osiris' restoration. By Ptolemaic )Tj
T*(times \(305â€“30 BC\), Khoiak also included the planting of seeds in an "Osiris )Tj
T*(bed", a mummy-shaped bed of soil, connecting the resurrection of Osiris with )Tj
T*(the seasonal growth of plants.[104] )Tj
T*( The myth's religious importance extended beyond the funerary sphere. Mortuary )Tj
T*(offerings, in which family members or hired priests presented food to the )Tj
T*(deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of )Tj
T*(Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated )Tj
T*(with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In )Tj
T*(temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took on the role of Horus, the )Tj
T*(gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these )Tj
T*(gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.[105] )Tj
T*( The ideology surrounding the living king was also affected by the Osiris myth. )Tj
T*(The Egyptians envisioned the events of the Osiris myth as taking place sometime )Tj
T*(in Egypt's dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors )Tj
T*(were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the Turin Royal )Tj
T*(Canon.[106] Horus, as a past king and as the personification of kingship, was )Tj
T*(regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His )Tj
T*(assumption of his predecessor's throne and pious actions to sustain that spirit )Tj
T*(in the afterlife were the model for all pharaonic successions to emulate.[107] )Tj
T*(Each new king was believed to renew maat after the death of the preceding king, )Tj
T*(just as Horus had done. In royal coronations, rituals alluded to Osiris' )Tj
T*(burial, and hymns celebrated the new king's accession as the equivalent of )Tj
T*(Horus' own.[78] )Tj
T*( The myth influenced popular religion as well. One example is the magical )Tj
T*(healing spells based on Horus' childhood. Another is the use of the Eye of )Tj
T*(Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological )Tj
T*(restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of )Tj
T*(well-being.[31] )Tj
T*( As the antagonist of the myth, Set did not enjoy increased popularity. )Tj
T*(Although he was credited with positive traits in the Osiris myth, the sinister )Tj
T*(aspects of his character predominate. Overall he was viewed with ambivalence )Tj
T*(until, during the first millennium BC, he came to be seen as a totally )Tj
T*(malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with )Tj
T*(foreign lands than by the Osiris myth.[108] Nevertheless, in these late times, )Tj
T*(the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were )Tj
T*(often connected with the myth.[109] )Tj
T*( Both Isis and Nephthys were seen as protectors of the dead in the afterlife )Tj

T*(because of their protection and restoration of Osiris' body.[110] Isis, as )Tj
T*(Horus' mother, was also the mother of every king according to royal ideology, )Tj
T*(and kings were said to have nursed at her breast as a symbol of their divine )Tj
T*(legitimacy.[111] Her appeal to the general populace was based in her protective )Tj
T*(character, as exemplified by the magical healing spells. In the Late Period, )Tj
T*(she was credited with ever greater magical power, and her maternal devotion was )Tj
T*(believed to extend to everyone. By Roman times she was the most important )Tj
T*(goddess in Egypt.[112] The image of the goddess holding her child was used )Tj
T*(prominently in her worshipâ€”for example, in panel paintings that were used in )Tj
T*(household shrines dedicated to her. Isis' iconography in these paintings )Tj
T*(closely resembles and probably influenced the earliest Christian icons of Mary )Tj
T*(holding Jesus.[113] )Tj
T*( In the late centuries BC, the worship of Isis spread from Egypt across the )Tj
T*(Mediterranean world, and she became one of the most popular deities in the )Tj
T*(region. Although this new, multicultural form of Isis absorbed characteristics )Tj
T*(from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother )Tj
T*(was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, )Tj
T*(spread along with her.[114] It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch )Tj
T*(wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.[115] Her importance continued into the )Tj
T*(fourth century AD, when Christianity eclipsed it. But Christianity absorbed )Tj
T*(many of the traditions surrounding Isis and incorporated them into the )Tj
T*(veneration of Mary, such as Isis' title "Mother of the God" \(referring to )Tj
T*(Horus\), which influenced Mary's title "Mother of God".[116] )Tj
T*( Through the work of classical writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the )Tj
T*(Osiris myth was preserved even after the middle of the first millennium AD, )Tj
T*(when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of the writing systems )Tj
T*(that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a )Tj
T*(major part of Western impressions of ancient Egypt. In modern times, when )Tj
T*(understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, )Tj
T*(the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction )Tj
T*(to scholarly speculation and new religious movements.[117] )Tj

T*( [edit] Background: early contacts between Japan and Spain )Tj
T*( The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain \(Mexico\) and the )Tj
T*(Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican )Tj
T*(mines westward to the entrepÃ´t of Manila in the Spanish possession of the )Tj
T*(Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods )Tj
T*(gathered from throughout Asia, including \(until 1638\) goods from Japan. The )Tj
T*(return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator )Tj
T*(AndrÃ©s de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current \(also )Tj
T*(known as the Japan Current\) off the coast of Japan, and then across the Pacific )Tj
T*(to the west coast of North America, landing eventually in Acapulco.[5] )Tj
T*( Spanish ships were periodically shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad )Tj
T*(weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the )Tj
T*(Christian faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by )Tj
T*(stiff resistance towards the Jesuits, who had started the evangelizing of the )Tj
T*(country in 1549, as well as by the opposition of Portuguese and the Dutch who )Tj
T*(did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade. However, some )Tj
T*(Japanese, such as Christopher and Cosmas, are known to have crossed the Pacific )Tj
T*(onboard Spanish galleons as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were )Tj
T*(exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who )Tj
T*(thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing "The black elephant in particular I found )Tj
T*(most unusual."[6] )Tj
T*( In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco encountered bad weather on )Tj
T*(its way from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in )Tj
T*(Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's )Tj
T*(captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met )Tj
T*(with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, )Tj
T*(signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in )Tj
T*(eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish )Tj
T*(ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese )Tj
T*(embassy would be sent to the Spanish court. )Tj
T*( [edit] First Japanese expeditions to the Americas )Tj
T*( [edit] 1610 San Buena Ventura )Tj
T*( A Franciscan monk named Luis Sotelo, who was proselytizing in the area of what )Tj
T*(is now modern Tokyo, convinced Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Tokugawa Hidetada to )Tj
T*(send him as a representative to New Spain \(Mexico\) on one of their ships, in )Tj
T*(order to advance the trade treaty. Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the )Tj
T*(Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain, )Tj
T*(but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso MuÃ±os, be sent instead as )Tj
T*(the Shogun's representative. In 1610, the returning Rodrigo de Vivero, several )Tj
T*(Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by )Tj
T*(the trader Tanaka ShÅsuke, sailed to Mexico aboard the San Buena Ventura, a )Tj
T*(ship built by the English adventurer William Adams for the Shogun. Once in New )Tj
T*(Spain, Alonso MuÃ±os met with the Viceroy Luis de Velasco, who agreed to send an )Tj
T*(ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebastian Vizcaino, )Tj
T*(with the added mission of exploring the "Gold and silver islands" \("Isla de )Tj
T*(Plata"\) that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles. )Tj
T*( Vizcaino arrived in Japan in 1611, and had many meetings with the Shogun and )Tj
T*(feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese )Tj
T*(customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards Catholic proselytism, )Tj
T*(and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions. Vizcaino finally left )Tj
T*(to search for the "Silver island", during which search he encountered bad )Tj
T*(weather, forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage. )Tj
T*( [edit] 1612 San Sebastian )Tj
T*( Without waiting for Vizcaino, another ship â€“ built in Izu by the Bakufu under )Tj
T*(the minister of the Navy Mukai Shogen, and named San Sebastian â€“ left for )Tj
T*(Mexico on 9 September 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two )Tj
T*(representatives of Date Masamune, with the objective of advancing the trade )Tj
T*(agreement with New Spain. However, the ship foundered a few miles from Uraga, )Tj
T*(and the expedition had to be abandoned. )Tj

T*( The Shogun decided to build a new galleon in Japan in order to bring Vizcaino )Tj
T*(back to Nueva EspaÃ±a, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by Luis )Tj
T*(Sotelo. The galleon, named Date Maru by the Japanese and later San Juan )Tj
T*(Bautista by the Spanish, took 45 days work in building, with the participation )Tj
T*(of technical experts from the Bakufu \(the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shogen, an )Tj

T*(Chief Carpenter\), 800 shipwrights, 700 smiths, and 3,000 carpenters. The daimyo )Tj
T*(of Sendai, Date Masamune, was put in charge of the project. He named one of his )Tj
T*(retainers, Hasekura Tsunenaga \(his fief was rated at around 600 koku\), to lead )Tj
T*(the mission: )Tj
T*( "The Great Ship left Toshima-Tsukinoura for the Southern Barbarians on 15 )Tj

T*(Date House, KeichÅ-Genna ä¼Šé”å®¶æ…¶é•·å…ƒå’Œç•™æŽ§, Gonoi p. 56\).)Tj
T*(  The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements )Tj
T*(with the Spanish crown in Madrid, and to meet with the Pope in Rome. Date )Tj
T*(Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: )Tj
T*(he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. )Tj
T*(In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: "I'll offer my land )Tj
T*(for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many padres as possible." )Tj
T*( Sotelo, in his own account of the travels, emphasizes the religious dimension )Tj
T*(of the mission, claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian )Tj
T*(faith in northern Japan: )Tj
T*( "I was formerly dispatched as ambassador of Idate Masamune, who holds the )Tj
T*(reins of the kingdom of Oxu [Japanese:å¥¥å·ž] \(which is in the Eastern part of )Tj
T*(Japan\) â€”who, while he has not yet been reborn through baptism, has been )Tj
T*(catechized, and was desirous that the Christian faith should be preached in his )Tj

T*(Rocuyemon, to the Roman Senate &amp; to the one who at that time was in charge )Tj
T*(of the Apostolic See, His Holiness Pope Paul V." \(Luis Sotelo De Ecclesiae )Tj
T*(Iaponicae Statu Relatio, 1634\).[7])Tj
T*(  The embassy was probably, at that time, part of a plan to diversify and )Tj
T*(increase trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians )Tj
T*(in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the Shogunate, with )Tj
T*(the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in )Tj
T*(1614. )Tj

T*( [edit] Return to Mexico )Tj
T*( Hasekura stayed for 5 months in Mexico on his way back to Japan. The San Juan )Tj
T*(Bautista was waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the )Tj
T*(Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shogen, she was laden with )Tj
T*(fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. )Tj
T*(Following a request by the Spanish king, in order to avoid too much silver )Tj
T*(leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the proceeds to be spent on Mexican )Tj
T*(goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which )Tj
T*(Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively. )Tj
T*( [edit] Philippines )Tj
T*( In April 1618, the San Juan Bautista arrived in the Philippines from Mexico, )Tj
T*(with Hasekura and Luis Sotelo on board. The ship was acquired by the Spanish )Tj
T*(government there, with the objective of building up defenses against the )Tj
T*(attacks of the Dutch and the English. The bishop of the Philippines with the )Tj
T*(local Filipinos and native Tagalog in Manila described the deal to the king of )Tj
T*(Spain in a missive dated 28 July 1619: )Tj
T*( "The Governor was extremely friendly with the Japanese, and provided them with )Tj
T*(his protection. As they had many expensive things to buy, they decided to lend )Tj
T*(their ship. The ship was immediately furbished for combat. The Governor )Tj
T*(eventually bought the ship, because it turned out that it was of excellent and )Tj
T*(sturdy construction, and available ships were dramatically few. In favour of )Tj
T*(your Majesty, the price paid was reasonable." \(Document 243\))Tj
T*(  During his stay in the Philippines with local Filipinos and Native Tagalog, )Tj
T*(Hasekura purchased numerous goods for Date Masamune, and built a ship, as he )Tj
T*(explained in a letter he wrote to his son. He finally returned to Japan in )Tj
T*(August 1620, reaching the harbour of Nagasaki. )Tj
T*( [edit] Return to Japan )Tj
T*( By the time Hasekura came back, Japan had changed quite drastically: an effort )Tj
T*(to eradicate Christianity had been under way since 1614, Tokugawa Ieyasu had )Tj
T*(died in 1616 and been replaced by his more xenophobic son Tokugawa Hidetada, )Tj
T*(and Japan was moving towards the "Sakoku" policy of isolation. Because news of )Tj
T*(these persecutions arrived in Europe during Hasekura's embassy, European rulers )Tj
T*(â€“ especially the King of Spain â€“ became very reluctant to respond favorably to )Tj
T*(Hasekura's trade and missionary proposals. )Tj
T*( Hasekura reported his travels to Date Masamune upon his arrival in Sendai. It )Tj
T*(is recorded that he remitted a portrait of Pope Paul V, a portrait of himself )Tj
T*(in prayer \(shown above\), and a set of Ceylonese and Indonesian daggers acquired )Tj
T*(in the Philippines, all preserved today in the Sendai City Museum. The "Records )Tj
T*(of the House of Masamune" describe his report in a rather succinct manner, )Tj
T*(ending with a rather cryptic expression of surprise bordering on the outrage )Tj
T*(\("å¥‡æ€ªæœ€å¤šã‚·"\) at Hasekura's discourse: )Tj
T*( "Rokuemon went to the country of the Southern Barbarians, he paid his respects )Tj
T*(to the king Paolo, he stayed there for several years, and now he sailed back )Tj
T*(from Luzon. He brought paintings of the king of the Southern Barbarians, and a )Tj
T*(painting of himself, which he remitted. Many of his descriptions of the )Tj
T*(Southern Barbarian countries, and the meaning of Rokuemon's declarations were )Tj
T*(surprising and extraordinary."[24])Tj

T*( The direct effect of Hasekura's return to Sendai was the interdiction of )Tj
T*(Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later: )Tj
T*( "Two days after the return of Rokuemon to Sendai, a three-point edict against )Tj

T*(who did not, they would be exiled if they were nobles, and killed if they were )Tj
T*(citizens, peasants or servants. Second, that a reward would be given for the )Tj

T*(  What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later )Tj
T*(events tend to indicate that he and his descendants remained faithful )Tj
T*(Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic â€“ and to a certain extent, )Tj
T*(disturbing â€“ account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the )Tj
T*(Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church )Tj
T*(and Date Masamune to take over the country \(an idea advertized by the )Tj
T*(Franciscans while in Rome\), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally )Tj
T*(unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when )Tj
T*(Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as )Tj
T*(long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country. )Tj
T*( Date Masamune, heretofore very tolerant of Christianity in spite of the )Tj
T*(Bakufu's prohibition in the land it directly controlled, thus suddenly chose to )Tj
T*(distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians )Tj
T*(started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were )Tj
T*(however comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly )Tj
T*(claimed that he only took them to appease the Shogun: )Tj
T*( "Date Masumune, out of fear of the Shogun, ordered the persecution of )Tj
T*(Christianity in his territory, and created several martyrs." \(Letter of 17 )Tj
T*(prominent Japanese Christians from Sendai, to the Pope, 29 September 1621\).[25])Tj
T*(  One month after Hasekura's return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the Shogun )Tj
T*(Tokugawa Hidetada, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade )Tj
T*(responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with )Tj
T*(the approval, and even the collaboration, of the Shogun: )Tj
T*( "When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian countries several years ago, )Tj
T*(upon the advice of Mukai Shogen, I also dispatched the Southern Barbarian named )Tj
T*(Sotelo, who had resided for several years in Edo. At that time, your highness )Tj
T*(also gave messages for the Southern Barbarians, as well as presents, such as )Tj
T*(folding screens and sets of armour." \(18 October 1620, quoted in Gonoi, p.Â 234\).)Tj
T*(  Spain was by far the most threatening power for Japan at that time \(with a )Tj
T*(colony and an army in the nearby Philippines\). Hasekura's eyewitness accounts )Tj
T*(of Spanish power and colonial methods in Nueva EspaÃ±a \(Mexico\) may have )Tj
T*(precipitated the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada's decision to sever trade relations )Tj
T*(with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events )Tj
T*(such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish )Tj
T*(embassy also contributed to the decision. )Tj
T*( What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are )Tj
T*(numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could only rely on hearsay, with )Tj
T*(some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was )Tj
T*(martyred for his faith, and others that he practiced Christianity in secret. )Tj
T*(The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being )Tj
T*(Christians, would suggest that Hasekura remained strongly Christian himself, )Tj
T*(and transmitted his faith to the members of his family. )Tj
T*( Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally burnt at the stake in )Tj
T*(1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a )Tj
T*(hero who propagated the Christian faith: )Tj
T*( "My other colleague, the ambassador Philippus Faxecura, after he reached his )Tj
T*(aforementioned king \(Date Masamune\), was greatly honored by him, and sent to )Tj
T*(his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his )Tj
T*(wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised )Tj
T*(other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed )Tj
T*(did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his )Tj

T*(preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special )Tj
T*(inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, and the protection of )Tj
T*(the religious \(i.e. "members of religious orders"\) in that kingdom. The King )Tj
T*(and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the )Tj

T*(himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by )Tj

T*(temple of Komyoji \(å…‰æ˜Žå¯º\). In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, )Tj
T*(Tarozaemon \(å¤ªéƒŽå·¦è¡›é–€, 71\), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife )Tj
T*(\(59\), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their )Tj
T*(faith under torture, died. Tsuneyori was held responsible this time and )Tj
T*(decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce )Tj
T*(Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was )Tj
T*(himself Christian or not.[27] Also, two Christian priests, the Dominican Pedro )Tj
T*(Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, had given his name under torture. Tsuneyori's )Tj
T*(younger brother, Tsunemichi, was convicted as a Christian, but managed to flee )Tj

T*( Altogether, around fifty Christian artifacts were found in Hasekura's estate )Tj
T*(in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. )Tj

T*(and 1941, after the Blitz, Pinter was evacuated from their house in London to )Tj
T*(Cornwall and Reading.[5] Billington states that the "life-and-death intensity )Tj
T*(of daily experience" before and during the Blitz left Pinter with profound )Tj
T*(memories "of loneliness, bewilderment, separation and loss: themes that are in )Tj
T*(all his works."[6] )Tj
T*( Pinter discovered his social potential as a student at Hackney Downs School, a )Tj
T*(London grammar school, between 1944 and 1948. "Partly through the school and )Tj
T*(partly through the social life of Hackney Boys' Club ... he formed an almost )Tj
T*(sacerdotal belief in the power of male friendship. The friends he made in those )Tj
T*(daysâ€”most particularly Henry Woolf, Michael \(Mick\) Goldstein and Morris )Tj
T*(\(Moishe\) Wernickâ€”have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his )Tj
T*(life."[4][7] A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher )Tj
T*(Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long )Tj
T*(walks, talking about literature.[8] According to Billington, under Brearley's )Tj
T*(instruction, "Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and )Tj
T*(discovered a gift for acting."[9][10] In 1947 and 1948, he played Romeo and )Tj
T*(Macbeth in productions directed by Brearley.[11] )Tj
T*( At the age of 12, Pinter began writing poetry, and in spring 1947, his poetry )Tj
T*(was first published in the Hackney Downs School Magazine.[12] In 1950, his )Tj
T*(poetry was first published outside of the school magazine in Poetry London, )Tj
T*(some of it under the pseudonym "Harold Pinta".[13][14] )Tj
T*( Sport and friendship )Tj
T*( Pinter enjoyed running and broke the Hackney Downs School sprinting )Tj
T*(record.[15][16] He was an avid cricket enthusiast, taking his bat with him when )Tj
T*(evacuated during the Blitz.[17] In 1971 he told Mel Gussow: "one of my main )Tj
T*(obsessions in life is the game of cricketâ€”I play and watch and read about it )Tj
T*(all the time."[18] He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of )Tj
T*(Yorkshire Cricket Club,[19] and devoted a section of his official website to )Tj
T*(the sport.[20] One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as )Tj
T*(a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The )Tj
T*(New York Times: "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked )Tj
T*(glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas."[21][22] Pinter )Tj
T*(approved of the "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of )Tj
T*(aggression."[23] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled )Tj
T*(his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running.[24] The BBC Radio 4 )Tj
T*(memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.[25] )Tj
T*( Other interests that Pinter mentioned to interviewers are family, love and )Tj
T*(sex, drinking, writing, and reading.[26] According to Billington, "If the )Tj
T*(notion of male loyalty, competitive rivalry and fear of betrayal forms a )Tj
T*(constant thread in Pinter's work from The Dwarfs onwards, its origins can be )Tj
T*(found in his teenage Hackney years. Pinter adores women, enjoys flirting with )Tj
T*(them, worships their resilience and strength. But, in his early work )Tj
T*(especially, they are often seen as disruptive influences on some pure and )Tj
T*(Platonic ideal of male friendship: one of the most crucial of all Pinter's lost )Tj
T*(Edens."[4][27] )Tj
T*( Early theatrical training and stage experience )Tj
T*( Beginning in late 1948, Pinter attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for )Tj
T*(two terms, but hating the school, missed most of his classes, feigned a nervous )Tj
T*(breakdown, and dropped out in 1949.[28] In 1948 he was called up for National )Tj
T*(Service. He registered as a conscientious objector, was brought to trial twice, )Tj
T*(and was ultimately fined for refusing to serve.[29] He had a small part in the )Tj
T*(Christmas pantomime Dick Whittington and His Cat at the Chesterfield Hippodrome )Tj
T*(in 1949 to 1950.[30] From January to July 1951, he attended the Central School )Tj
T*(of Speech and Drama.[31] )Tj
T*( From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland with the Anew McMaster repertory company, )Tj
T*(playing over a dozen roles.[32] In 1952 he began acting in regional English )Tj
T*(repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, he worked for the Donald Wolfit )Tj
T*(Company, at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles.[33][34] )Tj

T*(income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a )Tj
T*(snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, "harbouring ambitions as a )Tj
T*(poet and writer."[38] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: "I was in English rep as )Tj
T*(an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister )Tj
T*(ones. They're something to get your teeth into."[39] During that period, he )Tj
T*(also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and )Tj
T*(film, as he continued to do throughout his career.[36][40] )Tj
T*( Marriages and family life )Tj
T*( From 1956 until 1980, Pinter was married to Vivien Merchant, an actress whom )Tj
T*(he met on tour,[41] perhaps best known for her performance in the 1966 film )Tj
T*(Alfie. Their son, Daniel, was born in 1958.[42] Through the early 1970s, )Tj
T*(Merchant appeared in many of Pinter's works, including The Homecoming on stage )Tj
T*(\(1965\) and screen \(1973\), but the marriage was turbulent.[43] For seven years, )Tj
T*(from 1962 to 1969, Pinter was engaged in a clandestine affair with BBC-TV )Tj
T*(presenter and journalist Joan Bakewell, which inspired his 1978 play )Tj
T*(Betrayal,[44] and also throughout that period and beyond he had an affair with )Tj
T*(an American socialite, whom he nicknamed "Cleopatra". This relationship was )Tj
T*(another secret he kept from both his wife and Bakewell.[45] Initially, Betrayal )Tj
T*(was thought to be a response to his later affair with historian Antonia Fraser, )Tj
T*(the wife of Hugh Fraser, and Pinter's "marital crack-up".[46] )Tj
T*( Pinter and Merchant had both met Fraser in 1969, when all three worked )Tj
T*(together on a National Gallery programme about Mary, Queen of Scots; several )Tj
T*(years later, on 8â€“9 January 1975, Pinter and Fraser became romantically )Tj
T*(involved.[47] That meeting initiated their five-year extramarital love )Tj
T*(affair.[48][49] After hiding the relationship from Merchant for two and a half )Tj
T*(months, on 21 March 1975, Pinter finally told her "I've met somebody".[50] )Tj
T*(After that, "Life in Hanover Terrace gradually became impossible", and Pinter )Tj
T*(moved out of their house on 28 April 1975, five days after the premiÃ¨re of No )Tj
T*(Man's Land.[51][52] )Tj
T*( In mid-August 1977, after Pinter and Fraser had spent two years living in )Tj
T*(borrowed and rented quarters, they moved into her former family home in Holland )Tj
T*(Park,[53] where Pinter began writing Betrayal.[46] He reworked it later, while )Tj
T*(on holiday at the Grand Hotel, in Eastbourne, in early January 1978.[54] After )Tj
T*(the Frasers' divorce had become final in 1977 and the Pinters' in 1980, Pinter )Tj
T*(married Fraser on 27 November 1980.[55] Because of a two-week delay in )Tj
T*(Merchant's signing the divorce papers, however, the reception had to precede )Tj
T*(the actual ceremony, originally scheduled to occur on his 50th birthday.[56] )Tj
T*(Vivien Merchant died of acute alcoholism in the first week of October 1982, at )Tj
T*(the age of 53.[57][58] Billington writes that Pinter "did everything possible )Tj
T*(to support" her and regretted that he ultimately became estranged from their )Tj
T*(son, Daniel, after their separation, Pinter's remarriage, and Merchant's )Tj
T*(death.[59] )Tj
T*( A reclusive gifted musician and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter )Tj
T*(to Brand, the maiden name of his maternal grandmother,[60] before Pinter and )Tj
T*(Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father )Tj
T*(couldn't understand it, she says that she could: "Pinter is such a distinctive )Tj
T*(name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation?'"[61] Michael )Tj
T*(Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as "a largely pragmatic )Tj
T*(move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press ... at bay."[62] Fraser told )Tj
T*(Billington that Daniel "was very nice to me at a time when it would have been )Tj
T*(only too easy for him to have turned on me ... simply because he had been the )Tj
T*(sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't."[62] Still )Tj
T*(unreconciled at the time of his father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend )Tj
T*(Pinter's funeral.[63] )Tj
T*( Billington observes that "The break-up with Vivien and the new life with )Tj
T*(Antonia was to have a profound effect on Pinter's personality and his work," )Tj
T*(though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter )Tj
T*(or his writing.[60] In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January )Tj
T*(1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's literary midwife.[64] Indeed, )Tj
T*(she told Billington that "other people [such as Peggy Ashcroft, among others] )Tj

T*(had a shaping influence on [Pinter's] politics" and attributed changes in his )Tj
T*(writing and political views to a change from "an unhappy, complicated personal )Tj
T*(life ... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that "a side of Harold )Tj
T*(which had always been there was somehow released. I think you can see that in )Tj
T*(his work after No Man's Land [1975], which was a very bleak play."[60] )Tj
T*( Pinter was content in his second marriage and enjoyed family life with his six )Tj
T*(adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren.[65] Even after battling cancer )Tj
T*(for several years, he considered himself "a very lucky man in every )Tj
T*(respect".[66]Sarah Lyall notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in The New )Tj
T*(York Times that his "latest work, a slim pamphlet called "Six Poems for A.," )Tj
T*(comprises poems written over 32 years, with "A" of course being Lady Antonia. )Tj
T*(The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled )Tj
T*(soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, )Tj
T*(and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, when he talks about his wife."[21] In )Tj
T*(that interview Pinter "acknowledged that his playsâ€”full of infidelity, cruelty, )Tj
T*(inhumanity, the lotâ€”seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you )Tj
T*(write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of )Tj
T*(perturbation, disarray. I've never been able to write a happy play, but I've )Tj
T*(been able to enjoy a happy life.'"[21] After his death, Fraser told The )Tj
T*(Guardian: "He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over )Tj
T*(33 years. He will never be forgotten."[67][68] )Tj
T*( Civic activities and political activism )Tj
T*( In 1948â€“49, when he was 18, Pinter opposed the politics of the Cold War, )Tj
T*(leading to his decision to become a conscientious objector and to refuse to )Tj
T*(comply with National Service in the British military. But he was not a )Tj
T*(pacifist. He told interviewers that, if he had been old enough at the time, he )Tj
T*(would have fought against the Nazis in World War II.[69] He seemed to express )Tj
T*(ambivalence, both indifference and hostility, towards political structures and )Tj
T*(politicians in his Fall 1966 Paris Review interview conducted by Lawrence M. )Tj
T*(Bensky.[70] Yet, he had been an early member of the Campaign for Nuclear )Tj
T*(Disarmament and also had supported the British Anti-Apartheid Movement )Tj
T*(\(1959â€“1994\), participating in British artists' refusal to permit professional )Tj
T*(productions of their work in South Africa in 1963 and in subsequent related )Tj
T*(campaigns.[71][72][73] In "A Play and Its Politics", a 1985 interview with )Tj
T*(Nicholas Hern, Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the )Tj
T*(perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression.[74] )Tj
T*( In his last 25 years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, interviews and )Tj
T*(public appearances directly on political issues. He was an officer in )Tj
T*(International PEN, travelling with American playwright Arthur Miller to Turkey )Tj
T*(in 1985 on a mission co-sponsored with a Helsinki Watch committee to )Tj
T*(investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met )Tj
T*(victims of political oppression and their families. Pinter's experiences in )Tj
T*(Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language )Tj
T*(inspired his 1988 play Mountain Language.[75] He was also an active member of )Tj
T*(the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, an organisation that "campaigns in the UK against )Tj
T*(the US blockade of Cuba".[76] In 2001 Pinter joined the International Committee )Tj
T*(to Defend Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ \(ICDSM\), which appealed for a fair trial and for )Tj
T*(the freedom of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡, signing a related "Artists' Appeal for )Tj
T*(MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡" in 2004.[77] )Tj
T*( Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO bombing campaign in )Tj
T*(Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, the United States' 2001 War in Afghanistan, )Tj
T*(and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Among his provocative political statements, )Tj
T*(Pinter called Prime Minister Tony Blair a "deluded idiot" and compared the )Tj
T*(administration of President George W. Bush to Nazi Germany.[77][78] He stated )Tj
T*(that the United States "was charging towards world domination while the )Tj
T*(American public and Britain's 'mass-murdering' prime minister sat back and )Tj
T*(watched."[78] He was very active in the antiwar movement in the United Kingdom, )Tj
T*(speaking at rallies held by the Stop the War Coalition[79] and frequently )Tj

T*(blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of )Tj
T*(international law."[80][81][82] )Tj
T*( Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in )Tj
T*(Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and )Tj
T*(personal attacks.[83] The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official )Tj
T*(history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own "Jewish View" of Harold )Tj
T*(Pinter: "Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical )Tj
T*(plane Harold Pinter seems to me to have been intensely flawed, and his moral )Tj
T*(compass deeply fractured."[84]David Edgar, writing in The Guardian, defended )Tj
T*(Pinter against what he termed Pinter's "being berated by the belligerati" like )Tj
T*(Johann Hari, who felt that he did not "deserve" to win the Nobel Prize.[85][86] )Tj
T*(Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other )Tj
T*(political causes that he supported. As Alderman points out, for example, Pinter )Tj
T*(signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and )Tj
T*(its full-page advertisement, "What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", )Tj
T*(published in The Times on 6 July 2006,[84] and he was a patron of the Palestine )Tj
T*(Festival of Literature. )Tj
T*( Career )Tj
T*( As actor )Tj
T*( Pinter's acting career spanned over 50 years and, although he often played )Tj
T*(villains, included a wide range of roles on stage and in radio, film, and )Tj
T*(television.[33][87] In addition to roles in radio and television adaptations of )Tj
T*(his own plays and dramatic sketches, early in his screenwriting career he made )Tj
T*(several cameo appearances in films based on his own screenplays; for example, )Tj
T*(as a society man in The Servant \(1963\) and as Mr. Bell in Accident \(1967\), both )Tj
T*(directed by Joseph Losey; and as a bookshop customer in his later film Turtle )Tj
T*(Diary \(1985\), starring Michael Gambon, Glenda Jackson, and Ben Kingsley.[33] )Tj
T*( Pinter's notable film and television roles included the corrupt lawyer Saul )Tj

T*(totally brutal system [the slave trade] from which he derives his money"; and )Tj
T*(Uncle Benny, opposite Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush, in The Tailor of Panama )Tj
T*(\(2001\).[33] In television films, he played Mr. Bearing, the father of ovarian )Tj
T*(cancer patient Vivian Bearing, played by Emma Thompson in Mike Nichols's HBO )Tj

T*(award nominations, he and his plays received many awards in the UK and )Tj

T*(for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days.[97] The production )Tj
T*(was described by Billington as "a staggeringly confident debut which attracted )Tj

T*(Pinter's next play, The Birthday Party, at the Lyric Hammersmith, in 1958."[98] )Tj
T*( Written in 1957 and produced in 1958, Pinter's second play, The Birthday )Tj

T*(whatever reputation I have as a judge of plays by saying that The Birthday )Tj
T*(Party is not a Fourth, not even a Second, but a First [as in Class Honours]; )Tj
T*(and that Pinter, on the evidence of his work, possesses the most original, )Tj
T*(disturbing and arresting talent in theatrical LondonÂ ... Mr Pinter and The )Tj

T*(View: A Comedy of Menace, a play by David Campton, critic Irving Wardle called )Tj
T*(Pinter's early plays "comedy of menace"â€”a label that people have applied )Tj

T*(production of The Caretaker, at the Arts Theatre Club, in London, in 1960, )Tj
T*(established Pinter's theatrical reputation.[104] The play transferred to the )Tj
T*(Duchess Theatre in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances,[105] receiving an )Tj
T*(Evening Standard Award for best play of 1960.[106] Large radio and television )Tj
T*(audiences for his one-act play A Night Out, along with the popularity of his )Tj
T*(revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention.[107] In 1964, The )Tj
T*(Birthday Party was revived both on television \(with Pinter himself in the role )Tj
T*(of Goldberg\) and on stage \(directed by Pinter at the Aldwych Theatre\) and was )Tj
T*(well received.[108] )Tj
T*( By the time Peter Hall's London production of The Homecoming \(1964\) reached )Tj
T*(Broadway in 1967, Pinter had become a celebrity playwright, and the play )Tj
T*(garnered four Tony Awards, among other awards.[109] During this period, Pinter )Tj
T*(also wrote the radio play A Slight Ache, first broadcast on the BBC Third )Tj
T*(Programme in 1959 and then adapted to the stage and performed at the Arts )Tj
T*(Theatre Club in 1961. A Night Out \(1960\) was broadcast to a large audience on )Tj
T*(Associated British Corporation's television show Armchair Theatre, after being )Tj
T*(transmitted on BBC Radio 3, also in 1960. His play Night School was first )Tj
T*(televised in 1960 on Associated Rediffusion. The Collection premiÃ¨red at the )Tj
T*(Aldwych Theatre in 1962, and The Dwarfs, adapted from Pinter's then unpublished )Tj
T*(novel of the same title, was first broadcast on radio in 1960, then adapted for )Tj
T*(the stage \(also at the Arts Theatre Club\) in a double bill with The Lover, )Tj
T*(which was then televised on Associated Rediffusion in 1963; and Tea Party, a )Tj
T*(play that Pinter developed from his 1963 short story, first broadcast on BBC TV )Tj
T*(in 1965.[92] )Tj
T*( Working as both a screenwriter and as a playwright, Pinter composed a script )Tj
T*(called The Compartment \(1966\), for a trilogy of films to be contributed by )Tj
T*(Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, and Pinter, of which only Beckett's film, )Tj
T*(entitled Film, was actually produced. Then Pinter turned his unfilmed script )Tj
T*(into a television play, which was produced as The Basement, both on BBC 2 and )Tj
T*(also on stage in 1968.[110] )Tj
T*( "Memory plays" \(1968â€“1982\) )Tj
T*( From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Pinter wrote a series of plays )Tj
T*(and sketches that explore complex ambiguities, elegiac mysteries, comic )Tj
T*(vagaries, and other "quicksand-like" characteristics of memory and which )Tj
T*(critics sometimes classify as Pinter's "memory plays".[111] These include )Tj
T*(Landscape \(1968\), Silence \(1969\), Night \(1969\), Old Times \(1971\), No Man's Land )Tj
T*(\(1975\), The Proust Screenplay \(1977\), Betrayal \(1978\), Family Voices \(1981\), )Tj
T*(Victoria Station \(1982\), and A Kind of Alaska \(1982\). Some of Pinter's later )Tj
T*(plays, including Party Time \(1991\), Moonlight \(1993\), Ashes to Ashes \(1996\), )Tj
T*(and Celebration \(2000\) draw upon some features of his "memory" dramaturgy in )Tj
T*(their focus on the past in the present, but they have personal and political )Tj
T*(resonances and other tonal differences from these earlier memory )Tj
T*(plays.[111][112] )Tj
T*( Overtly political plays and sketches \(1980â€“2000\) )Tj
T*( Following a three-year period of creative drought in the early 1980s after his )Tj
T*(marriage to Antonia Fraser and the death of Vivien Merchant,[113] Pinter's )Tj
T*(plays tended to become shorter and more overtly political, serving as critiques )Tj
T*(of oppression, torture, and other abuses of human rights,[114] linked by the )Tj
T*(apparent "invulnerability of power."[115] Just before this hiatus, in 1979, )Tj
T*(Pinter re-discovered his manuscript of The Hothouse, which he had written in )Tj
T*(1958 but had set aside; he revised it and then directed its first production )Tj
T*(himself at Hampstead Theatre in London, in 1980.[116] Like his plays of the )Tj
T*(1980s, The Hothouse concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, )Tj
T*(but it is also a comedy, like his earlier comedies of menace. Pinter played the )Tj
T*(major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.[117] )Tj
T*( Pinter's brief dramatic sketch Precisely \(1983\) is a duologue between two )Tj
T*(bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation )Tj
T*(and deterrence. His first overtly political one-act play is One for the Road )Tj
T*(\(1984\). In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented )Tj
T*(metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities )Tj

T*(at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the )Tj
T*(production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in )Tj
T*(1994.[120] Pinter's longer political satire Party Time \(1991\) premiÃ¨red at the )Tj
T*(Almeida Theatre in London, in a double-bill with Mountain Language. Pinter )Tj
T*(adapted it as a screenplay for television in 1992, directing that production, )Tj
T*(first broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 on 17 November 1992.[121] )Tj
T*( Intertwining political and personal concerns, his next full-length plays, )Tj
T*(Moonlight \(1993\) and Ashes to Ashes \(1996\) are set in domestic households and )Tj
T*(focus on dying and death; in their personal conversations in Ashes to Ashes, )Tj
T*(Devlin and Rebecca allude to unspecified atrocities relating to the )Tj
T*(Holocaust.[122] After experiencing the deaths of first his mother \(1992\) and )Tj
T*(then his father \(1997\), again merging the personal and the political, Pinter )Tj
T*(wrote the poems "Death" \(1997\) and "The Disappeared" \(1998\). )Tj
T*( Pinter's last stage play, Celebration \(2000\), is a social satire set in an )Tj
T*(opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's )Tj
T*(West End theatre district, and its patrons who "have just come from )Tj
T*(performances of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a )Tj
T*(darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [These] gilded, )Tj
T*(foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic when it comes to their own table mates )Tj
T*(\(and for that matter, their food\), with conversations that usually connect only )Tj
T*(on the surface, if there."[123] On its surface the play may appear to have )Tj
T*(fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and )Tj
T*(1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are )Tj
T*(members of the elite \(like the men in charge in Party Time\), who describe )Tj
T*(themselves as "peaceful strategy consultants [because] we don't carry )Tj
T*(guns."[124] At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a )Tj
T*("totally disordered personality ... a psychopath,"[125] while Lambert "vows to )Tj
T*(be reincarnated as '[a] more civilised, [a] gentler person, [a] nicer )Tj
T*(person'."[126][127] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their )Tj
T*(extreme viciousness. Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political )Tj
T*(contexts: "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'Â ... and the quieter )Tj
T*(working-class mumblers of 'The Room'Â ... have everything in common beneath the )Tj
T*(surface".[123] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the )Tj
T*(brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and )Tj
T*(violenceÂ ... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions )Tj
T*(of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political )Tj
T*(structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's )Tj
T*(pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo.[128] Yet, as the )Tj
T*(Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather )Tj
T*(demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some )Tj
T*(expressionistic aspects of his earlier "memory plays", while harking back to )Tj
T*(his "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's )Tj
T*(final speech: )Tj
T*( )Tj

T*( An Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, a Fellow of the Royal )Tj
T*(Society of Literature, and an Honorary Fellow of the Modern Language )Tj
T*(Association of America \(1970\),[183][184] Pinter was appointed CBE in 1966[185] )Tj
T*(and became a Companion of Honour in 2002, having declined a knighthood in )Tj
T*(1996.[186] In 1995, he accepted the David Cohen Prize, in recognition of a )Tj
T*(lifetime of literary achievement. In 1996, he received a Laurence Olivier )Tj
T*(Special Award for lifetime achievement in the theatre.[187] In 1997 he became a )Tj
T*(BAFTA Fellow.[188] He received the World Leaders Award for "Creative Genius" as )Tj
T*(the subject of a week-long "Homage" in Toronto, in October 2001.[189] In 2004, )Tj
T*(he received the Wilfred Owen Award for Poetry for his "lifelong contribution to )Tj
T*(literature, 'and specifically for his collection of poetry entitled War, )Tj
T*(published in 2003'".[190] In March 2006, he was awarded the Europe Theatre )Tj
T*(Prize in recognition of lifetime achievements pertaining to drama and )Tj
T*(theatre.[191] In conjunction with that award, the critic Michael Billington )Tj
T*(coordinated an international conference on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, )Tj
T*(including scholars and critics from Europe and the Americas, held in Turin, )Tj
T*(Italy, from 10 to 14 March 2006.[111][158][192] )Tj
T*( In October 2008, the Central School of Speech and Drama announced that Pinter )Tj
T*(had agreed to become its president and awarded him an honorary fellowship at )Tj
T*(its graduation ceremony.[193] On his appointment, Pinter commented: "I was a )Tj
T*(student at Central in 1950â€“51. I enjoyed my time there very much and I am )Tj
T*(delighted to become president of a remarkable institution."[194] But he had to )Tj
T*(receive that honorary degree, his 20th, in absentia owing to ll health.[193] )Tj
T*(His presidency of the school was brief; he died just two weeks after the )Tj
T*(graduation ceremony, on 24 December 2008. )Tj
T*( Nobel Prize and Nobel Lecture )Tj
T*( On 13 October 2005, the Swedish Academy announced that it had decided to award )Tj
T*(the Nobel Prize in Literature for that year to Pinter, who "in his plays )Tj
T*(uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into )Tj
T*(oppression's closed rooms".[195] Its selection instigated some public )Tj
T*(controversy and criticism relating both to characteristics of Pinter's work and )Tj
T*(to his politics.[83] When interviewed that day about his reaction to the )Tj
T*(announcement, Pinter said: "I was told today that one of the Sky channels said )Tj
T*(this morning that 'Harold Pinter is dead.' Then they changed their mind and )Tj
T*(said, 'No, he's won the Nobel prize.' So I've risen from the dead."[196] The )Tj
T*(Nobel Prize Awards Ceremony and related events throughout Scandinavia took )Tj
T*(place in December 2005. After the Academy notified Pinter of his award, he had )Tj
T*(planned to travel to Stockholm to present his Nobel Lecture in person.[197] In )Tj
T*(November, however, his doctor sent him to hospital and barred such travel, )Tj
T*(after a serious infection was diagnosed. Pinter's publisher, Stephen Page of )Tj
T*(Faber and Faber, accepted the Nobel Diploma and Nobel Medal at the Awards )Tj
T*(Ceremony in his place.[21][198] )Tj
T*( Although still being treated in hospital, Pinter videotaped his Nobel Lecture, )Tj
T*("Art, Truth and Politics", at a Channel 4 studio. It was projected on three )Tj
T*(large screens at the Swedish Academy on the evening of 7 December )Tj
T*(2005,[21][199] and transmitted on More 4 that same evening in the UK.[200] The )Tj
T*(46-minute lecture was introduced on television by David Hare. Later, the text )Tj
T*(and streaming video formats \(without Hare's introduction\) were posted on the )Tj
T*(Nobel Prize and Swedish Academy official websites. It has since been released )Tj
T*(as a DVD.[201] )Tj
T*( Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf speaking to Raymond Seitz, then Minister at )Tj
T*(the US Embassy in London, "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a )Tj

T*(government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." Seitz )Tj
T*(responded, "Let me tell you something. In war, innocent people always suffer." )Tj
T*(Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq "an arbitrary military action inspired by )Tj
T*(a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of )Tj
T*(the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.[202] )Tj
T*( Pinter's lecture has been widely distributed by print and online media and has )Tj
T*(provoked much commentary and debate,[203] with some commentators accusing )Tj
T*(Pinter of "anti-Americanism".[204] In his Nobel Lecture, however, Pinter )Tj
T*(emphasises that he criticises policies and practices of American )Tj
T*(administrations \(and those who voted for them\), not all American citizens, many )Tj
T*(of whom he recognises as "demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their )Tj
T*(government's actions".[202] )Tj
T*( LÃ©gion d'honneur )Tj
T*( On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin presented )Tj
T*(Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the LÃ©gion d'honneur, at a ceremony )Tj
T*(at the French Embassy in London. De Villepin praised Pinter's poem "American )Tj
T*(Football" \(1991\) stating: "With its violence and its cruelty, it is for me one )Tj
T*(of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the )Tj
T*(temptation of imperialism and violence." In response, Pinter praised France's )Tj
T*(opposition to the war in Iraq. M. de Villepin concluded: "The poet stands still )Tj
T*(and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how )Tj
T*(to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." He said that Pinter )Tj
T*(received the award particularly "because in seeking to capture all the facets )Tj
T*(of the human spirit, [Pinter's] works respond to the aspirations of the French )Tj
T*(public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly )Tj
T*(universal".[205][206] Lawrence Pollard observed that "the award for the great )Tj
T*(playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as )Tj
T*(a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".[205] )Tj
T*( Scholarly response )Tj
T*( Some scholars and critics challenge the validity of Pinter's critiques of what )Tj
T*(he terms "the modes of thinking of those in power"[207] or dissent from his )Tj
T*(retrospective viewpoints on his own work.[208] In 1985, Pinter recalled that )Tj
T*(his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being "terribly )Tj
T*(disturbed as a young man by the Cold War. And McCarthyismÂ ... A profound )Tj
T*(hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression )Tj
T*(of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then )Tj
T*(and feel as strongly now that we have an obligation to subject our own actions )Tj
T*(and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny."[209] Scholars )Tj
T*(agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this )Tj
T*(scrutiny.[210] )Tj
T*( Pinter's aversion to any censorship by "the authorities" is epitomised in )Tj
T*(Petey's line at the end of The Birthday Party. As the broken-down and )Tj
T*(reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg )Tj
T*(and McCann, Petey calls after him, "Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!" )Tj
T*(Pinter told Gussow in 1988, "I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more )Tj
T*(than now."[211] The example of Pinter's stalwart opposition to what he termed )Tj
T*("the modes of thinking of those in power"â€”the "brick wall" of the "minds" )Tj
T*(perpetuating the "status quo"[212]â€”infused the "vast political pessimism" that )Tj
T*(some academic critics may perceive in his artistic work,[213] its "drowning )Tj
T*(landscape" of harsh contemporary realities, with some residual "hope for )Tj
T*(restoring the dignity of man."[214] )Tj
T*( As Pinter's long-time friend David Jones reminded analytically inclined )Tj
T*(scholars and dramatic critics, Pinter was one of the "great comic )Tj
T*(writers":[215] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The trap with Harold's work, for performers and audiences, is to approach it )Tj
T*(too earnestly or portentously. I have always tried to interpret his plays with )Tj

T*( Warwick Castle \(i/ËˆwÉ’rÉªk/ WORR-ik\) is a medieval castle developed from an )Tj
T*(original built by William the Conqueror in 1068. Warwick is the county town of )Tj
T*(Warwickshire, England, situated on a bend of the River Avon. The original )Tj
T*(wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. During )Tj
T*(the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting )Tj
T*(in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th century military architecture. )Tj
T*(It was used as a stronghold until the early 17th century, when it was granted )Tj
T*(to Sir Fulke Greville by James I in 1604. Sir Fulke Greville converted it to a )Tj
T*(country house. It was owned by the Greville family, who became earls of Warwick )Tj
T*(in 1759, until 1978 when it was bought by the Tussauds Group. )Tj
T*( [edit] Location )Tj
T*( Warwick Castle is situated in the town of Warwick, on a sandstone bluff at a )Tj
T*(bend of the River Avon. The river, which runs below the castle on the east )Tj
T*(side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff. The river and )Tj
T*(cliff form natural defences. When construction began in 1068, four houses )Tj
T*(belonging to the Abbot of Coventry were demolished to provide room. The )Tj
T*(castle's position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands )Tj
T*(against rebellion.[1] During the 12th century, King Henry I was suspicious of )Tj
T*(Roger de Beaumont, 2ndÂ Earl of Warwick. To counter the earl's influence, Henry )Tj
T*(bestowed Geoffrey de Clinton with a position of power rivalling that of the )Tj
T*(earl.[2] The lands he was given included KenilworthÂ â€“ a castle of comparable )Tj
T*(size, cost, and importance,[3] founded by Clinton[4]Â â€“ which is about 8 )Tj
T*(kilometres \(5Â mi\) to the north. Warwick Castle is about 1.6 kilometres \(1Â mi\) )Tj
T*(from Warwick railway station and less than 3.2 kilometres \(2.0Â mi\) from )Tj
T*(junction 15 of the M40 motorway; it is also close to Birmingham International )Tj
T*(Airport.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Antecedent )Tj
T*( An Anglo-Saxon burh was established on the site in 914; with fortifications )Tj
T*(instigated by Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the Great. The burh she )Tj
T*(established was one of ten which defended Mercia against the marauding Danes. )Tj
T*(Its position allowed it to dominate the Fosse Way, as well as the river valley )Tj
T*(and the crossing over the River Avon. Though the motte to the south-west of the )Tj
T*(present castle is now called "Ethelfleda's Mound", it is in fact part of the )Tj
T*(later Norman fortifications, and not of Anglo-Saxon origin.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Middle Ages )Tj
T*( After the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror established a )Tj
T*(motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 to maintain control of the Midlands )Tj
T*(as he advanced northwards.[7][8] Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement )Tj
T*(could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of )Tj

T*(houses were torn down to make way for the castle.[9] A motte-and-bailey castle )Tj
T*(consists of a moundÂ â€“ on which usually stands a keep or towerÂ â€“ and a bailey, )Tj
T*(which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed Henry de Beaumont, the son of )Tj
T*(a powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle.[1] In 1088, Henry de )Tj
T*(Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick.[1] He founded the Church of All )Tj
T*(Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that )Tj
T*(a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127â€“28.[1] )Tj
T*( In 1153, the wife of Roger de Beaumont, 2ndÂ Earl of Warwick, was tricked into )Tj
T*(believing that her husband was dead, and surrendered control of the castle to )Tj
T*(the invading army of Henry of Anjou, later King Henry II.[1][10] According to )Tj
T*(the Gesta Regis Stephani, a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont )Tj
T*(died on hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle.[11] Henry )Tj
T*(later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick as they had been supporters )Tj
T*(of his mother, Empress Matilda, in The Anarchy of 1135â€“54.[12] )Tj
T*( From 1088, the castle had traditionally belonged to the Earl of Warwick, and )Tj
T*(it served as a symbol of his power. The castle was taken in 1153 by Henry of )Tj
T*(Anjou, later Henry II. It has been used to hold prisoners, including some from )Tj
T*(the Battle of Poitiers in the 14th century. Under the ownership of Richard )Tj
T*(NevilleÂ â€“ also known as "Warwick the Kingmaker"Â â€“ Warwick Castle was used in )Tj
T*(the 15th century to imprison the English king, Edward IV. )Tj
T*( During the reign of King Henry II \(1154â€“89\), the motte-and-bailey was replaced )Tj
T*(with a stone castle. This new phase took the form of a shell keep with all the )Tj
T*(buildings constructed against the curtain wall.[13] During the barons' )Tj
T*(rebellion of 1173â€“74, the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and )Tj
T*(the castle was used to store provisions.[1] The castle and the lands associated )Tj
T*(with the earldom passed down in the Beaumont family until 1242. When Thomas de )Tj
T*(Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick, died the castle and lands passed to his sister, )Tj
T*(Lady Margery, countess of Warwick in her own right. Her husband died soon )Tj
T*(after, and while she looked for a suitable husband, the castle was in the )Tj
T*(ownership of King Henry III. When she married John du Plessis in December 1242, )Tj
T*(the castle was returned to her.[1] During the Second Barons' War of 1264â€“67, )Tj
T*(William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick, was a supporter of King Henry III.[1] The )Tj
T*(castle was taken in a surprise attack by the forces of Simon de Montfort, 6th )Tj
T*(Earl of Leicester, from Kenilworth Castle in 1264.[1] The walls along the )Tj
T*(northeastern side of the castle were slighted so that it would be useless to )Tj
T*(the king.[1] Maudit and his countess were taken to Kenilworth Castle and held )Tj
T*(until a ransom was paid. After the death of William Mauduit in 1267, the title )Tj
T*(and castle passed to his nephew William de Beauchamp, 9thÂ Earl of Warwick. )Tj
T*(Following William's death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of )Tj
T*(the Beauchamp family, who over the next 180Â years were responsible for most of )Tj
T*(the additions made to the castle. In 1312, Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of )Tj
T*(Cornwall, was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, and )Tj
T*(imprisoned in Warwick Castle until his execution on 9 June 1312.[1][14] A group )Tj
T*(of magnates led by the Earl of Warwick and Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, )Tj
T*(accused Gaveston of stealing the royal treasure.[15] )Tj
T*( Under Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl,[1][16] the castle defences were )Tj
T*(significantly enhanced in 1330â€“60 on the north eastern side by the addition of )Tj
T*(a gatehouse, a barbican \(a form of fortified gateway\), and a tower on either )Tj
T*(side of the reconstructed wall, named Caesar's Tower and Guy's Tower.[16][17] )Tj
T*(The Watergate Tower also dates from this period.[18] )Tj
T*( Caesar's and Guy's Towers are residential and may have been inspired by French )Tj
T*(models \(for example Bricquebec\). Both towers are machicolated and Caesar's )Tj
T*(Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in )Tj
T*(stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained a "grim" basement dungeon;[19] )Tj
T*(according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as )Tj
T*(Poitiers Tower either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may )Tj
T*(have been imprisoned there or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped )Tj
T*(to pay for its construction.[1] The gatehouse features murder holes, two )Tj
T*(drawbridges, a gate, and portcullisesÂ â€“ gates made from wood or metal.[20] The )Tj
T*(towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.[21] )Tj

T*( The facade overlooking the river was designed as a symbol of the power and )Tj
T*(wealth of the Beauchamp earls and would have been "of minimal defensive value"; )Tj
T*(this followed a trend of 14th-century castles being more statements of power )Tj
T*(than designed exclusively for military use.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] 15th and 16th centuries )Tj
T*( The line of Beauchamp earls ended in 1449 when Anne de Beauchamp, 15th )Tj
T*(Countess of Warwick, died.[1] Richard Neville became the next Earl of Warwick )Tj
T*(through his wife's inheritance of the title. During the summer of 1469, Neville )Tj
T*(rebelled against King Edward IV and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville )Tj
T*(attempted to rule in the king's name;[1] however, constant protests by the )Tj
T*(king's supporters forced the Earl to release the king. Neville was subsequently )Tj
T*(killed in the Battle of Barnet, fighting against King Edward IV in 1471 during )Tj
T*(the Wars of the Roses. Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his )Tj
T*(son-in-law, George Plantagenet. George Plantagenet was executed in 1478 and his )Tj
T*(lands passed onto Edward Plantagenet, 17thÂ Earl of Warwick; however, Edward )Tj
T*(Plantagenet was only two when his father died so his lands were taken in the )Tj
T*(custody of The Crown. He had a claim to the throne and was imprisoned first by )Tj
T*(Edward IV, then Richard III, and finally by Henry VII. He was held in the Tower )Tj
T*(of London until he was executed for high treason by Henry VII in 1499;[23] )Tj
T*(Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.[1] )Tj
T*( In the early 1480s King Richard III instigated the construction of two gun )Tj
T*(towers, Bear and Clarence Towers, which were left unfinished on his death in )Tj
T*(1485; with their own well and ovens, the towers were an independent stronghold )Tj
T*(from the rest of the castle, possibly in case of mutiny by the garrison. With )Tj
T*(the advent of gunpowder the position of Keeper of the Artillery was created in )Tj
T*(1486.[1] )Tj
T*( When antiquary John Leland visited the castle some time between 1535 and 1543, )Tj
T*(he noted that: )Tj
T*(...Â the dungeon now in ruin standeth in the west-north-west part of the castle. )Tj
T*(There is also a tower west-north-west, and through it a postern-gate of iron. )Tj
T*(All the principal lodgings of the castle with the hall and chapel lie on the )Tj
T*(south side of the castle, and here the king doth much cost in making )Tj
T*(foundations in the rocks to sustain that side of the castle, for great pieces )Tj
T*(fell out of the rocks that sustain it.[1])Tj
T*(  )Tj
T*(While in the care of The Crown, Warwick Castle underwent repairs and )Tj
T*(renovations using about 500Â loads of stone. The castle, as well as lands )Tj
T*(associated with the earldom, was in Crown care from 1478 until 1547, when they )Tj
T*(were granted to John Dudley with the second creation of the title the Earl of )Tj
T*(Warwick.[1] When making his appeal for ownership of the castle Dudley said of )Tj
T*(the castle's condition: "...Â the castle of its self is not able to lodge a good )Tj
T*(baron with his train, for all the one side of the said castle with also the )Tj
T*(dungeon tower is clearly ruinated and down to the ground".[1] )Tj
T*( Warwick Castle had fallen into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite )Tj
T*(his remarks Dudley did not initiate any repairs to the castle.[1]Queen )Tj
T*(Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1566 during a tour of the country, and again )Tj
T*(in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to )Tj
T*(stay in, and Ambrose Dudley, 3rdÂ Earl of Warwick, left the castle to the Queen )Tj
T*(during her visits.[1] When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of )Tj
T*(Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that )Tj
T*(the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen )Tj
T*(from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings including the chapel.[1] In )Tj
T*(1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that "the little stone building there was, )Tj
T*(mightily in decayÂ ... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a )Tj
T*(name of Warwick".[1] )Tj
T*( Sir Fulke Greville was granted Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604.[24] )Tj
T*( In the 17th century the grounds were turned into a garden. The castle's )Tj
T*(defences were enhanced in the 1640s to prepare the castle for action in the )Tj

T*( [edit] 17th century country house )Tj
T*( The conversion of the castle coincided with a period of decline in the use of )Tj
T*(castles during the 15th and 16th centuries; many were either being abandoned or )Tj
T*(converted into comfortable residences for the gentry.[25] In the early 17th )Tj
T*(century, Robert Smythson was commissioned to draw a plan of the castle before )Tj
T*(any changes were made.[1] In 1604, the ruinous castle was given to Sir Fulke )Tj
T*(Greville by King James I and was converted into a country house.[7] Whilst the )Tj
T*(castle was undergoing repairs, it was peripherally involved in the Gunpowder )Tj
T*(Plot of 1605. The conspirators involved awaited news of their plot in Dunchurch )Tj
T*(in Warwickshire. When they discovered the plot had failed they stole cavalry )Tj
T*(horses from the stables at Warwick Castle to help in their escape.[1] When the )Tj
T*(title of Earl of Warwick was created for the third time in 1618, the Greville )Tj
T*(family were still in possession of Warwick Castle. Fulke Greville spent over )Tj
T*(Â£20,000 \(Â£3Â million as of 2013\).[26] renovating the castle; according to )Tj
T*(William Dugdale, a 17th century antiquary, this made it "a place not only of )Tj
T*(great strength but extraordinary delight, with most pleasant gardens, walks and )Tj
T*(thickets, such as this part of England can hardly parallel".[1] On 1Â September )Tj
T*(1628 Fulke Greville was murdered in Holborn by his manservant: Ralph Haywoodâ€”a )Tj
T*("gentleman"â€”who stabbed the baron in the back after discovering he had been )Tj
T*(left out of Greville's will. Greville died from his wounds a few days )Tj
T*(later.[27] )Tj
T*( Under Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, Warwick Castle's defences were )Tj
T*(enhanced from January to May 1642 in preparation for attack during the First )Tj
T*(English Civil War. The garden walls were raised, bulwarksâ€”barricades of beams )Tj
T*(and soil to mount artilleryâ€”were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two )Tj
T*(cannons were obtained.[1] Robert Greville was a Parliamentarian, and on 7 )Tj
T*(August 1642 a Royalist force laid siege to the castle. Greville was not in the )Tj
T*(castle at the time and the garrison was under the command of Sir Edward Peyto. )Tj
T*(Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton, Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire )Tj
T*(commanded the Royalist force. William Dugdale, acting as a herald, called for )Tj
T*(the garrison commander to surrender the castle, but he was refused. The )Tj
T*(besieging army opened fire on the castle, to little effect.[1] According to )Tj
T*(Richard Bulstrode: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(...Â our endeavours for taking it were to little purpose, for we had only two )Tj
T*(small pieces of cannon which were brought from Compton House, belonging to the )Tj
T*(Earl of Northampton, and those were drawn up to the top of the church steeple, )Tj
T*(and were discharged at the castle, to which they could do no hurt, but only )Tj
T*(frightened them within the castle, who shot into the street, and killed several )Tj
T*(of our men.[28])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The siege was lifted on 23 August 1642 when the garrison was relieved by the )Tj
T*(forces of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, and the Royalists were forced to )Tj
T*(retreat to Worcester.[1] After the Battle of Edgehill in 1642Â â€“ the first )Tj
T*(pitched battle of the English Civil WarÂ â€“ prisoners were held in Caesar's and )Tj
T*(Guy's Towers.[1] During the Second English Civil War prisoners were again held )Tj
T*(at the castle, including those from the Battle of Worcester in 1651. A garrison )Tj
T*(was maintained in the castle complete with artillery and supplies from 1643 to )Tj
T*(1660, at its strongest it numbered 302 soldiers. In 1660 the English Council of )Tj
T*(State ordered the castle governor to disband the garrison and hand over the )Tj
T*(castle to Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke.[1] The state apartments were )Tj
T*(found to be outmoded and in poor repair. Under Roger and William Hurlbutt, )Tj
T*(master carpenters of Warwick, extensive modernization of the interiors was )Tj
T*(undertaken, 1669â€“78. To ensure that they would be in the latest taste, William )Tj
T*(was sent down to Dorset to make careful notes of the interiors recently )Tj

T*(improvements to Warwick Castle and its grounds. The 8th Baron Brooke was also )Tj
T*(bestowed with the title Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the )Tj
T*(title. With the recreation of the title, the castle was back in the ownership )Tj
T*(of the earls of Warwick. Daniel Garrett's work at Warwick is documented in )Tj
T*(1748; Howard Colvin attributed to him the Gothick interior of the )Tj
T*(Chapel.[31]Lancelot "Capability" Brown had been on hand since 1749.[32] Brown, )Tj
T*(who was still head gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his )Tj
T*(reputation as the main exponent of the English landscape garden, was called in )Tj
T*(by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more "natural" connection to its river. )Tj
T*(Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that )Tj
T*(dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native )Tj
T*(trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the )Tj
T*(front gates and the castle entrance.[33] )Tj
T*( Horace Walpole saw Brown's maturing scheme in 1751 and remarked in a letter: )Tj
T*("The castle is enchanting. The view pleased me more than I can express; the )Tj
T*(river Avon tumbled down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one )Tj
T*(Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr Southcote."[34] )Tj
T*( In 1754 the poet Thomas Gray, a member of Walpole's Gothicising circle, )Tj
T*(commented disdainfully on the activity at the castle: )Tj
T*(...Â he [Francis Greville] has sash'd[35] the great apartmentÂ ... and being )Tj
T*(since told, that square sash windows were not Gothic, he has put certain )Tj
T*(whimwams withinside the glass, which appearing through are to look like )Tj
T*(fretwork. Then he has scooped out a little burrough in the massy walls of the )Tj
T*(place for his little self[36] and his children, which is hung with paper and )Tj
T*(printed linnen, and carved chimney-pieces, in the exact manner of )Tj
T*(Berkley-square or Argyle Buildings.[1])Tj
T*(  )Tj
T*(Gray's mention of Argyle Buildings, Westminster, London,[37] elicited a )Tj
T*(connotation of an inappropriately modern Georgian urban development, for the )Tj
T*(buildings in Argyll Street were a speculation to designs of James Gibbs, )Tj
T*(1736â€“40.[38] )Tj
T*( Greville commissioned Italian painter Antonio Canaletto to paint Warwick )Tj
T*(Castle in 1747,[39] while the castle grounds and gardens were undergoing )Tj
T*(landscaping by Brown. Five paintings and three drawings of the castle by )Tj
T*(Canaletto are known, making it the artist's most often represented building in )Tj
T*(Britain.[40] Canaletto's work on Warwick Castle has been described as "unique )Tj
T*(in the history of art as a series of views of an English house by a major )Tj
T*(continental master".[41] As well as the gardens, Greville commissioned Brown to )Tj
T*(rebuild the exterior entrance porch and stairway to the Great Hall.[42] Brown )Tj
T*(also contributed Gothick designs for a wooden bridge over the Avon \(1758\).[43] )Tj
T*(He was still at work on Warwick Castle in 1760. Timothy Lightoler was )Tj
T*(responsible for the porch being extended and extra rooms added adjacent to it )Tj
T*(in 1763â€“69.[42] and during the same years William Lindley provided a new Dining )Tj
T*(Room and other interior alterations.[44] In 1786â€“88 the local builder William )Tj
T*(Eboral was commissioned to build the new greenhouse conservatory, with as its )Tj
T*(principal ornament the Warwick Vase, recently purchased in Rome.[45] )Tj
T*( In 1802 George Greville, 2ndÂ Earl of Warwick of the new creation, had debts )Tj
T*(amounting to Â£115,000 \(Â£8Â million as of 2013\).[26] The earl's estates, )Tj
T*(including Warwick Castle, were given to the Earl of Galloway and John )Tj
T*(FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory, in 1806, but the castle was returned to )Tj
T*(the earls of Warwick in 1813.[1] The Great Hall was reroofed and repaired in )Tj
T*(Gothic taste in 1830â€“31 by Ambrose Poynter.[46]Anthony Salvin was responsible )Tj
T*(for restoring the Watergate Tower in 1861â€“63.[42] The castle was extensively )Tj
T*(damaged by a fire in 1871 that started to the east of the Great Hall. Although )Tj
T*(the Great Hall was gutted, the overall structure was unharmed.[1] Restoration )Tj
T*(and reparations carried out by Salvin during 1872â€“75 were subsidised by )Tj
T*(donations from the public, which raised a total of Â£9,651 \(Â£670Â thousand as of )Tj

T*(visited the 4th earl with great local celebrations. However by 1885 it would )Tj
T*(appear the visitors were becoming a nuisance as the earl closed the castle to )Tj

T*(last week eight American visitors who were staying at one of the principal )Tj
T*(hotels left somewhat hurriedly in consequence of their being unable to gain )Tj

T*(enthusing not just that "these walls have seen something of the splendour of )Tj

T*(it was getting in excess of half a million visitors a year.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Heritage protection )Tj
T*( The castle is protected against unauthorised change as a Scheduled Ancient )Tj
T*(Monument[7] in recognition of its status as a "nationally important" )Tj
T*(archaeological site or historic building,[54] and is a Grade I listed )Tj
T*(building[42] together with its boundary walls, stables, conservatory, mill and )Tj
T*(lodge.[42] )Tj
T*( In May 2007 Tussauds was purchased by Merlin Entertainments who continue to )Tj
T*(operate the castle on a lease, having sold the freehold to Nick Leslau's )Tj
T*(Prestbury Group on 17 July 2007.[55] )Tj
T*( On 23 June 2006, a Â£20,000 stained glass window was damaged by teeenage )Tj
T*(vandals and a ceremonial sword stolen, recovered soon after.[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Warwick trebuchet )Tj
T*( In June 2005, Warwick Castle became home to one of the world's largest working )Tj
T*(siege engines. The trebuchet is 18 metres \(59Â ft\) tall, made from over 300 )Tj
T*(pieces of oak and weighs 22 tonnes \(24Â short tons\).[57] The machine, which was )Tj
T*(made in Wiltshire, is situated on the riverbank below the castle. It takes )Tj
T*(eight men half an hour to load and release [58], the process involves four men )Tj
T*(running in 4 metres \(13Â ft\) tall wheels to lift the counterweight, weighing 6 )Tj
T*(tonnes \(7Â short tons\) into the air. It is designed to be capable of hurling )Tj
T*(projectiles distances of up to 300 metres \(980Â ft\) and as high as 25 metres \(82Â )Tj
T*(ft\) and can throw projectiles weighing up to 150 kilograms \(330Â lb\).[58] On 21 )Tj
T*(August 2006, the trebuchet claimed the record as the most powerful catapult of )Tj
T*(its type when it sent a projectile weighing 13 kilograms \(29Â lb\) a distance of )Tj
T*(249 metres \(817Â ft\) at a speed of 260 kilometres per hour \(160Â mph\), beating )Tj
T*(the previous record held by a machine in Denmark.[59] )Tj
T*( [edit] Seasonal exhibits )Tj
T*( Other tourist attractions include "Flight of the Eagles'" \(a bird show, )Tj
T*(featuring bald eagles, vultures, and sea eagles\),[60] archery displays, )Tj
T*(Jousting,"The Trebuchet Show" and "The Sword In The Stone Show". The Castle is )Tj
T*(also home to "The Castle Dungeon", a live actor experience similar to that of )Tj
T*("London Dungeons". Warwick Castle is the subject of many ghost stories.[61] One )Tj
T*(such instance is that of Fulke Greville who is said to haunt the Watergate )Tj
T*(Tower despite having been murdered in Holborn. The castle's reputation for )Tj
T*(being haunted is used as a tourist attraction with events such as "Warwick )Tj
T*(Ghosts Alive", a live-action show telling the story of Fulke Greville's )Tj
T*(murder.[62] Musical events at the castle have included carolling, with )Tj
T*(performances by bands such as the Royal Spa Brass.[63][64] )Tj

T*( The current castle, built in stone during the reign of King Henry II, is on )Tj
T*(the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A keep used to )Tj
T*(stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the )Tj
T*(structure now dates from the post-medieval period.[1] In the 17th century the )Tj
T*(motte was landscaped with the addition of a path.[65] The bailey was )Tj
T*(incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.[1] )Tj
T*( When Warwick Castle was rebuilt in the reign of King Henry II it had a new )Tj
T*(layout with the buildings against the curtain walls. The castle is surrounded )Tj
T*(by a dry moat on the northern side where there is no protection from the river )Tj
T*(or the old motte; the perimeter of the walls is 130 metres \(140Â yd\) long by 82 )Tj
T*(metres \(90Â yd\) wide.[1] The two entrances to castle are in the north and west )Tj
T*(walls. There was originally a drawbridge over the moat in the north east. In )Tj
T*(the centre of the north west wall is a gateway with Clarence and Bears towers )Tj
T*(on either side; this is a 15th century addition to the fortifications of the )Tj
T*(castle.[1] The residential buildings line the eastern side of the castle, )Tj
T*(facing the River Avon. These buildings include the great hall, the library, )Tj
T*(bedrooms, and the chapel.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Owners )Tj
T*( Over its 950 years of history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 different )Tj
T*(individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different )Tj
T*(monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of )Tj
T*(Warwick, and has been a family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, )Tj
T*(Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the )Tj
T*(Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, )Tj
T*(so the castle three times had a woman \(or girl\) as the owner. Eleven of the )Tj
T*(owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy )Tj
T*(aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one )Tj
T*(murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or )Tj
T*(adaptations at the castle. )Tj
T*( [edit] Grounds and park )Tj
T*( Formal gardens belonging to Warwick Castle were first recorded in 1534.[66] )Tj
T*(Landscaping in the 17th century added spiral paths to the castle motte during )Tj
T*(Fulke Greville's programme of restoration.[1][65] Francis Greville commissioned )Tj
T*(Lancelot Brown to relandscape the castle grounds; he began working on the )Tj
T*(grounds and park in 1749 and had completed his work by 1757, having spent about )Tj
T*(Â£2,293 \(Â£260Â thousand as of 2013\).[26] on the project.[67] The gardens cover )Tj
T*(2.8 square kilometres \(690Â acres\).[66]Robert Marnock created formal gardens in )Tj
T*(the castle's grounds in 1868â€“69.[66] Started in 1743 and originally known as )Tj
T*(Temple Park, Castle Park is located to the south of the castle. Its original )Tj
T*(name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. )Tj
T*(Houses around the perimeter of the park were demolished and the land they stood )Tj
T*(on incorporated into the park.[1] Attempts to make profits from the park in the )Tj
T*(late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping )Tj
T*(sheep.[1] )Tj
T*( A water-powered mill in the castle grounds was probably built under Henry de )Tj
T*(Beaumont, 1stÂ Earl of Warwick.[1] By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just )Tj
T*(outside the eastern castle walls, on the west bank of the River Avon. Both )Tj
T*(mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the )Tj
T*(mill.[1] The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had )Tj
T*(stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains )Tj
T*(electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in )Tj
T*(1954.[1] Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but )Tj
T*(open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this )Tj
T*(garden \(see photo on the right\). )Tj

T*(and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. )Tj
T*(He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play Dr Samsi. )Tj
T*( After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also )Tj
T*(worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he )Tj
T*(was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with )Tj
T*(marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese )Tj
T*(occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return )Tj
T*(to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four )Tj
T*(screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a )Tj
T*(novel, Noesa Penida \(1950\). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life )Tj
T*(writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians )Tj
T*(recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian )Tj
T*(film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life and theatre )Tj
T*( Andjar was born Abisin Abbas[1] in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26Â )Tj
T*(February 1902. He gravitated toward traditional theatre at a young age after )Tj
T*(visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he )Tj
T*(pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen.[4] After )Tj
T*(completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs )Tj
T*(\(junior high school\) levelÂ â€“ first in Malay-language schools then Dutch onesÂ â€“ )Tj
T*(he moved to Batavia \(modern day Jakarta\). He worked as a reporter for two daily )Tj
T*(newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a )Tj
T*(farm.[4] )Tj
T*( Around 1925, having had little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, )Tj
T*(where he was a reporter for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he )Tj
T*(worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to )Tj
T*(the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural )Tj
T*(style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story;[4] he referred to )Tj
T*(this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote )Tj

T*(for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by )Tj
T*(Swan Pen,[a][4] and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1923 novel by Marah Roesli. These works )Tj
T*(were well received.[4] )Tj
T*( In the late 1920s, after spending some two years in Medan with the daily Sinar )Tj
T*(Soematra, Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine )Tj
T*(Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; )Tj
T*(although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the )Tj
T*(domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was )Tj
T*(becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng \(The Lost )Tj
T*(Lutung\), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 )Tj
T*(and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical )Tj
T*(productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar )Tj
T*(inspired the marketing for 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively )Tj
T*(native cast.[b] In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film and was replaced by Bachtiar )Tj
T*(Effendi. )Tj
T*( Andjar became a writer for the theatrical troupe Dardanella in November 1930, )Tj
T*(working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro.[c] Andjar believed the )Tj
T*(troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not )Tj
T*(only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes.[d] )Tj
T*(He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi )Tj
T*(and Singa Minangkabau \(The Lion of Minangkabau\).[4] Andjar also worked as a )Tj
T*(theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, )Tj
T*(sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went )Tj
T*(with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, )Tj
T*(which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo )Tj
T*(discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and )Tj
T*(Andjar left India with his wife Ratna. )Tj
T*( [edit] Film career and death )Tj
T*( Upon his return to the Indies, Andjar formed another theatrical troupe, )Tj
T*(Bolero, with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf )Tj
T*(Publishers in Surabaya. Effendi was left as the head of Bolero, which then )Tj
T*(became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine )Tj
T*(Poestaka Timoer.[1] As his work entailed writing synopses and serials based on )Tj
T*(popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film )Tj
T*(industry. He was soon asked by The Teng Chun, with whom he had maintained a )Tj
T*(business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film )Tj
T*(\(JIF\); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who )Tj
T*(migrated to film following Albert Balink's 1937 hit Terang Boelan \(Full Moon\). )Tj
T*( After handling the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh \(Rencong of Aceh, 1940\), )Tj
T*(Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance )Tj
T*(starring Ratna Asmara.Academia was critical of the film, believing it to lack )Tj
T*(educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, )Tj
T*(for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative )Tj
T*(control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie )Tj
T*(Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen )Tj
T*(by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer. )Tj
T*( During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, the nation's film industry )Tj
T*(nearly ceased to exist: all but one studio were closed, and all films released )Tj
T*(were propaganda pieces to assist the Japanese war effort and promote the )Tj
T*(Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Andjar was not involved in these but )Tj
T*(was excited by the artistic merits of Japanese films. Although he wrote several )Tj
T*(short stories during this time, three of which were published in the )Tj
T*(pro-Japanese newspaper Asia Raja in 1942, Andjar focused on theatre, forming )Tj
T*(the troupe Tjahaya Timoer. He often visited the Cultural Centre \(Keimin Bunka )Tj
T*(Sidosho\) in Jakarta, where two employees, D. Djajakusuma and Usmar Ismail, )Tj
T*(discussed filmmaking with him. Both became influential film directors during )Tj
T*(the 1950s.[e] )Tj
T*( After Indonesia's independence, Andjar moved to Purwokerto to lead the daily )Tj

T*(1948. This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan \(Moon Orchid; )Tj
T*(1948\) and Gadis Desa \(Maiden from the Village; 1949\), both based on plays he )Tj
T*(wrote several years earlier.[1] In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa )Tj
T*(Penida, a critique of the Balinese caste system, which followed lovers from )Tj
T*(different levels of the social hierarchy.[35] Meanwhile, he continued to write )Tj
T*(and publish paperback serials adapted from local films. )Tj
T*( Andjar's screenplay Dr Samsi was finally adapted as a film in 1952 by Ratna )Tj
T*(Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 )Tj
T*(film Sedap Malam \(Tuberose\). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It )Tj
T*(would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no )Tj
T*(longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In )Tj
T*(1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized )Tj
T*(when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam )Tj
T*(Malam \(After the Curfew\) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat )Tj
T*(Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin )Tj
T*(Malik, Tarmina's producer, had influenced the jury's decision.[f] )Tj
T*( In 1958 Asmara became the head of the entertainment magazine Varia, where the )Tj
T*(fellow director Raden Ariffien served as his deputy. Asmara held the position )Tj
T*(until his death; among other roles, he wrote a series of memoires on the )Tj
T*(history of theatre in the country.[1] He died on 20Â October 1961 in Cipanas, )Tj
T*(West Java, during a trip to Bandung and was buried in Jakarta. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Andjar's toneels were generally based on day-to-day experiences, rather than )Tj
T*(the tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. )Tj
T*(Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes )Tj
T*(that Andjar's stage plays, as well as those of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong )Tj
T*(Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he )Tj
T*(considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar )Tj
T*(believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in )Tj
T*(West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the )Tj
T*(Indies. )Tj
T*( Matthew Isaac Cohen, a scholar of Indonesian performing arts, describes Andjar )Tj
T*(as "Indonesia's foremost theater critic during the colonial period", noting )Tj
T*(that he wrote extensively on the history of theatre in the Indies. Cohen also )Tj
T*(believes that Andjar also worked to justify the toneel style and distance it )Tj
T*(from the earlier stambul. Even after entering the film industry, Andjar )Tj
T*(considered the theatre more culturally significant than cinema. However, the )Tj
T*(Indonesian journalist Soebagio I.N. writes that Andjar remains best known for )Tj
T*(his film work. )Tj
T*( Andjar was one of the first native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar )Tj
T*(Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari.[g] Said writes that Andjar was forced to )Tj
T*(follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which resulted in the )Tj
T*(films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of )Tj
T*(artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and )Tj
T*(his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that )Tj
T*(helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; )Tj
T*(the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years. )Tj

T*(at a medical research institute where Isobel was working as a secretary and )Tj
T*(Frank as a medical researcher. Hawking's parents lived in Highgate but as )Tj
T*(London was under attack during the Second World War, his mother went to Oxford )Tj
T*(to give birth in greater safety. He has two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, )Tj
T*(and an adopted brother, Edward. Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House )Tj
T*(School; he later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to )Tj
T*(read while at the school. )Tj
T*( In 1950, when his father became head of the division of parasitology at the )Tj
T*(National Institute for Medical Research, Hawking and his family moved to St )Tj
T*(Albans, Hertfordshire. The eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High )Tj
T*(School for Girls for a few months; at that time, younger boys could attend one )Tj
T*(of the houses. In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and )Tj
T*(eccentric. They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly )Tj
T*(maintained house, and travelled in a converted London taxicab. The family )Tj
T*(placed a high value on education, with regular trips to museums, and meals )Tj
T*(spent with everyone reading in silence. During one of Hawking's father's )Tj
T*(frequent absences working in Africa, the rest of the family spent four months )Tj
T*(in Majorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert )Tj
T*(Graves. On their return to England, Hawking attended Radlett School for a year )Tj
T*(and from September 1952, St Albans School. Hawking's father wanted his son to )Tj
T*(attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but 13-year-old Hawking was ill on )Tj
T*(the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school )Tj
T*(fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St )Tj
T*(Albans. As a positive consequence, Hawking remained with the close group of )Tj
T*(friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model )Tj
T*(aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory )Tj
T*(perception. From 1958, and with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran )Tj
T*(Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and )Tj
T*(other recycled components. )Tj
T*( Although at school he was known as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially )Tj
T*(successful academically. With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for )Tj
T*(scientific subjects, and inspired by Tahta, decided to study mathematics at )Tj
T*(university.[24] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that )Tj
T*(there were few jobs for mathematics graduates, and wanted Hawking to attend )Tj
T*(University College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read )Tj
T*(mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry, )Tj
T*(and despite his headmaster's advice to wait till the next year, took the )Tj
T*(scholarship examinations in March 1959. Following his good performance on )Tj
T*(examination and on interview, University College accepted Hawking and offered )Tj
T*(him a scholarship. )Tj
T*( University studies )Tj
T*( Hawking went up to Oxford in October 1959 at the age of 17. For the first 18 )Tj
T*(months he was bored and lonely: he was younger than many other students, and )Tj
T*(found the academic work "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, )Tj
T*(later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be )Tj
T*(done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it." A )Tj
T*(change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, )Tj
T*(Hawking made more effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, )Tj
T*(lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science )Tj
T*(fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the )Tj
T*(college Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing team. The rowing trainer at the time )Tj
T*(noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky )Tj
T*(courses that led to damaged boats. )Tj
T*( Hawking has estimated that he studied for only approximately 1000 hours during )Tj
T*(his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his )Tj
T*(Finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics rather )Tj
T*(than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a )Tj
T*(condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the )Tj
T*(University of Cambridge with Fred Hoyle. Anxious, he slept poorly the night )Tj

T*(first and second class honours, making a viva necessary. Hawking was concerned )Tj
T*(that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student, so when asked at the oral )Tj
T*(examination to describe his future plans said, "If you award me a First, I will )Tj
T*(go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you )Tj
T*(will give me a First." He was held in higher regard than he believed: as Berman )Tj
T*(commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realize they were talking )Tj
T*(to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class )Tj
T*(BA \(Hons.\) degree, and following a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his )Tj
T*(graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in October 1962. )Tj
T*( Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was a difficult one. He was )Tj
T*(initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama )Tj
T*(as a supervisor rather than Hoyle, and he found his training in mathematics )Tj
T*(inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. He was also struggling )Tj
T*(with his health. Hawking had noticed clumsiness during his final year at )Tj
T*(Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.[45] The )Tj
T*(problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred; his family noticed )Tj
T*(the issues when he returned home for Christmas and medical investigations were )Tj
T*(begun. The diagnosis of motor neurone disease came when Hawking was 21. At the )Tj
T*(time doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years. but Hawking's illness has )Tj
T*(advanced more slowly than typical cases of ALS.[51] After his diagnosis, )Tj
T*(Hawking fell into a depression; though his doctors advised that he continue )Tj
T*(with his studies, he felt there was little point. At the same time, however, )Tj
T*(his relationship with Jane Wilde, friend of his sister, and whom he had met )Tj
T*(shortly before his diagnosis, continued to develop. The couple were engaged in )Tj
T*(October 1964. Hawking later said that the engagement "gave him something to )Tj
T*(live for." Despite the disease's progressionâ€”Hawking had difficulty walking )Tj
T*(without support, and his speech was almost unintelligibleâ€”he now returned to )Tj
T*(his work with enthusiasm. Hawking started developing a reputation for )Tj
T*(brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and )Tj
T*(his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964. When Hawking began his )Tj
T*(graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the )Tj
T*(prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and the )Tj
T*(Steady State theories. Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime )Tj
T*(singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to )Tj
T*(the entire universe, and during 1965 wrote up his thesis on this topic. There )Tj
T*(were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at )Tj
T*(Gonville and Caius College, and he and Jane were married on July 14, 1965. He )Tj
T*(completed his doctorate in March 1966, and his essay entitled "Singularities )Tj
T*(and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win )Tj
T*(that year's Adams Prize. )Tj
T*( Career )Tj
T*( 1966â€“75 )Tj
T*( The first years of marriage were hectic: Jane lived in London during the week )Tj
T*(as she completed her degree and they travelled to the United States several )Tj
T*(times for conferences and physics-related visits. The couple had difficulty )Tj
T*(finding housing that was within Hawking's walking distance to the Department of )Tj
T*(Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics \(DAMTP\). Jane began a Ph.D/ )Tj
T*(program, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967. In his work, and in )Tj
T*(collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts )Tj
T*(first explored in his Ph.D. thesis. This included not only the existence of )Tj
T*(singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a )Tj
T*(singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research )Tj
T*(Foundation competition. In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe )Tj
T*(obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical )Tj
T*(cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a )Tj
T*(singularity.[70] )Tj
T*( During the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined once again: he )Tj

T*(achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head.[74] Hawking )Tj
T*(was, however, fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make )Tj
T*(concessions for his disabilities. Jane Hawking later noted that "Some people )Tj
T*(would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or )Tj
T*(another." He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the )Tj
T*(end of the 1960s. Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness as )Tj
T*(well as his reputation for brashness and intelligence distanced him from some. )Tj
T*(In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created 'Fellowship for Distinction in )Tj
T*(Science' to remain at Caius. )Tj
T*( A daughter, Lucy, was born in 1970. Soon after Hawking discovered what became )Tj
T*(known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a )Tj
T*(black hole can never get smaller. With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he )Tj
T*(proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with )Tj
T*(thermodynamics. To Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student )Tj
T*(of John Wheeler, went furtherâ€”and ultimately correctlyâ€”applying thermodynamic )Tj
T*(concepts literally. In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner )Tj
T*(Israel and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem that )Tj
T*(no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created it can )Tj
T*(be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and )Tj
T*(rotation.[85] His essay titled "Black Holes" won the Gravity Research )Tj
T*(Foundation Award in January 1971. Hawking's first book The Large Scale )Tj
T*(Structure of Space-Time written with George Ellis was published in 1973. )Tj
T*( Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum )Tj
T*(mechanics. His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and )Tj
T*(discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexander Starobinsky, whose )Tj
T*(work showed that according to the uncertainty principle rotating black holes )Tj
T*(emit particles. To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced )Tj
T*(findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could )Tj
T*(never get smaller, and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy. )Tj
T*(His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit )Tj
T*(radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they )Tj
T*(exhaust their energy and evaporate.[92][93] Initially, Hawking radiation was )Tj
T*(controversial. However by the late 1970s and following the publication of )Tj
T*(further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant )Tj
T*(breakthrough in theoretical physics. In March 1974, a few weeks after the )Tj
T*(announcement of Hawking radiation, Hawking was invested as a Fellow of the )Tj
T*(Royal Society, one of the youngest scientists to be so honoured. )Tj
T*( Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, evenâ€”in a )Tj
T*(precedent set during their courtshipâ€”with Jane. Hawking's disabilities meant )Tj
T*(that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's )Tj
T*(increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about )Tj
T*(physics. When in 1974 Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild )Tj
T*(Distinguished Scholar visiting professorship at the California Institute of )Tj
T*(Technology \(Caltech\), Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student )Tj
T*(live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr )Tj
T*(travelled to California with them as the first of many students who fulfilled )Tj
T*(this role.[103] The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in )Tj
T*(Pasadena. Hawking worked with his friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne, and )Tj
T*(engaged him in scientific wager about whether the dark star Cygnus X-1 was a )Tj
T*(black hole. The wager was a surprising "insurance policy" against the )Tj
T*(proposition that black holes did not exist. Hawking acknowledged that he had )Tj
T*(lost the bet in 1990, which was the first of several that he was to make with )Tj
T*(Thorne and others. Hawking has maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month )Tj
T*(there almost every year since this first visit. )Tj
T*( 1975â€“1990 )Tj
T*( Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home, a new jobâ€”as Reader. Don )Tj
T*(Page, with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at CalTech, arrived to )Tj
T*(work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a )Tj

T*(received increasing academic recognition of his work. In 1975 he was awarded )Tj
T*(both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie )Tj
T*(Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Prize and the Hughes Medal. Hawking was appointed a )Tj
T*(professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977. The following year he )Tj
T*(received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the )Tj
T*(University of Oxford. The Hawking family welcomed a third child, Timothy, in )Tj
T*(April 1979. That autumn Hawking was appointed the Lucasian Professor of )Tj
T*(Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a position he held for 30 years )Tj
T*(until he retired in 2009.[116] Hawking's inaugural lecture as Lucasian )Tj
T*(Professor of Mathematics was titled: "Is the end in sight for Theoretical )Tj
T*(Physics" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading theory solve many of the )Tj
T*(outstanding problems physicists were studying. Hawking's promotion coincided )Tj
T*(with a health crisis which led to Hawking accepting, albeit reluctantly, some )Tj
T*(nursing services at home. At the same time he was also making a transition in )Tj
T*(his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than )Tj
T*(insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would rather be right than rigorous" he )Tj
T*(told Kip Thorne. In 1981 he proposed that information in a black hole is )Tj
T*(irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox )Tj
T*(violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and was to lead to years )Tj
T*(of debate, including "the Black Hole War" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't )Tj
T*(Hooft.[121] )Tj
T*( In December 1977, Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in )Tj
T*(a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the )Tj
T*(mid 1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other. )Tj
T*(According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating "he )Tj
T*(would not object so long as I continued to love him." Jane and Hellyer Jones )Tj
T*(determined not to break up the family and their relationship remained platonic )Tj
T*(for a long period. )Tj
T*( Cosmological inflationâ€”a theory proposing that following the Big Bang the )Tj
T*(universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower )Tj
T*(expansionâ€”was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde. )Tj
T*(Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons )Tj
T*(organized a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on the Very )Tj
T*(Early Universe at Cambridge University, which focussed mainly on inflation )Tj
T*(theory.[129][130] Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into )Tj
T*(the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference he presented work )Tj
T*(suggesting that there might be no boundaryâ€”or beginning or endingâ€”to the )Tj
T*(universe. He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim )Tj
T*(Hartle, and in 1983 they published developed a model, known as the )Tj
T*(Hartleâ€“Hawking state. It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch, the universe )Tj
T*(had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the )Tj
T*(concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.[133] The initial )Tj
T*(singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to )Tj
T*(the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no )Tj
T*(boundary thereâ€”it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and )Tj
T*(end. Initially the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe which had )Tj
T*(implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained "If the universe )Tj
T*(has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any )Tj
T*(freedom to choose how the universe began." But Hawking did not rule out the )Tj
T*(existence of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time "Is the unified )Tj
T*(theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?" In his early )Tj
T*(work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of Time )Tj
T*(he wrote: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph )Tj
T*(of human reasonâ€”for then we should know the mind of God."[138] In the same book )Tj
T*(he suggested the existence of God was unnecessary to explain the origin of the )Tj
T*(universe.[139] Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that it )Tj
T*(is also compatible with an open universe. Further work by Hawking in the area )Tj
T*(of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the )Tj

T*(no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding )Tj
T*(and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A paper by Don Page and )Tj
T*(Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept. Honours continued to be )Tj
T*(awarded: in 1981 Hawking he was awarded the American Franklin Medal, and in )Tj
T*(1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \(CBE\). Awards do not )Tj
T*(pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's )Tj
T*(education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book )Tj
T*(about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. Instead )Tj
T*(publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a )Tj
T*(mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. A first draft )Tj
T*(of the book, called A Brief History of Time was completed in 1984. During a )Tj
T*(visit to CERN in Geneva in the summer of 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia )Tj
T*(which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked )Tj
T*(if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a )Tj
T*(tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what )Tj
T*(remained of his speech. The National Health Service would pay for a nursing )Tj
T*(home but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care )Tj
T*(was funded by an American foundation. Nurses were hired for the three shifts )Tj
T*(required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those )Tj
T*(employed was Elaine Mason, a vivacious woman who was to become Hawking's second )Tj
T*(wife. )Tj
T*( For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters )Tj
T*(on a spelling card. But he then received a computer program called the )Tj
T*("Equalizer" from Walt Woltosz. In a method he uses to this day, using a switch )Tj
T*(he selects phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2500-3000 that are )Tj
T*(scanned. The program was originally run on desktop computer. However Elaine )Tj
T*(Mason's husband David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and )Tj
T*(attached it to his wheelchair. Released from the need to use somebody to )Tj
T*(interpret his speech, Hawking commented that "I can communicate better now than )Tj
T*(before I lost my voice." The voice he uses has an American accent and is no )Tj
T*(longer produced.[162] Despite the availability of other voices, Hawking has )Tj
T*(retained his original voice, saying that he prefers his current voice and )Tj
T*(identifies with it.[163] At this point, Hawking activated a switch using his )Tj
T*(hand and could produce up to 15 words a minute. Lectures were prepared in )Tj
T*(advance, and sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections as they were )Tj
T*(delivered. )Tj
T*( One of first messages Hawking produced in on his speech generating device was )Tj
T*(a request for his assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time. )Tj
T*(Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly )Tj
T*(in non-technical language, a process that required multiple revisions from an )Tj
T*(increasingly irritated Hawking. The book was published in April 1988 in the US )Tj
T*(and in June in the UK, and proved to be extraordinary success, rising quickly )Tj
T*(to the top of bestseller lists in both countries and remaining there for weeks )Tj
T*(and months.[168] The book was translated into multiple languages, and )Tj
T*(ultimately sold an estimated 9 million copies.[168] Media attention was )Tj
T*(intense, and Newsweek magazine cover and a television special both described )Tj
T*(him as "Master of the Universe". Success led to significant financial rewards, )Tj
T*(but also the challenges of celebrity status. Hawking travelled extensively to )Tj
T*(promote his work. He had difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors which )Tj
T*(left limited time for work and his students. Some colleagues were resentful of )Tj
T*(the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due of his disability. He )Tj
T*(received further academic recognition, including five further honorary degrees, )Tj

T*(God."[178] Hawking's agnostic views of religion also contrasted with her strong )Tj
T*(Christian faith, and resulted in tension.[178] In the late 1980s Hawking had )Tj
T*(grown close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some )Tj
T*(colleagues, carers and family members who were disturbed by her strength of )Tj
T*(personality and protectiveness. Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for )Tj
T*(Mason, and departed the family home in February 1990. Following his divorce )Tj
T*(from Jane in the spring of 1995, Hawking married Mason in September, declaring )Tj
T*("It's wonderfulâ€”I have married the woman I love." Hawking pursued his work in )Tj
T*(physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary )Tj
T*(Gibbons, and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes )Tj
T*(and the Big Bang. In 1994 at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose )Tj
T*(delivered a series of six lectures, which were published in 1996 as "The Nature )Tj
T*(of Space and Time". In 1997 he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made )Tj
T*(with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's )Tj
T*(proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture"â€”that there could be no "naked )Tj
T*(singularities" unclothed within a horizonâ€”was correct. After discovering his )Tj
T*(concession might have been premature, a new, more refined, wager was made. This )Tj
T*(specified that that such singularities would occur without extra conditions. )Tj
T*(The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time )Tj
T*(concerning the black hole information paradox.[188] Thorne and Hawking argued )Tj
T*(that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and )Tj
T*(lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking Radiation )Tj
T*(must be "new", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this )Tj
T*(contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory )Tj
T*(would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum )Tj
T*(mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to )Tj
T*(information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given )Tj
T*(by general relativity must be modified in some way.[189] Hawking also )Tj
T*(maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. )Tj
T*(In 1992 a film version of "A Brief History of Time"â€”directed by Errol Morris )Tj
T*(and produced by Stephen Spielbergâ€”was premiered. Hawking had wanted the film to )Tj
T*(be scientific rather than biographical, but was persuaded otherwise. The film, )Tj
T*(while a critical success, was however not widely released. A popular-level )Tj
T*(collection of essays, interviews and talk titled Black Holes and Baby Universes )Tj
T*(and Other Essays was published in 1993 and six-part television series Stephen )Tj
T*(Hawking's Universe and companion book appeared in 1997. This time, as Hawking )Tj
T*(insisted, the focus was entirely on science. He also made several appearances )Tj
T*(in popular media. At the release party for the home video version of the "A )Tj
T*(Brief History of Time", Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, )Tj
T*(learnt that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the )Tj
T*(necessary contact and Hawking appeared as himself on Star Trek: The Next )Tj
T*(Generation in 1993. The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the )Tj
T*(Pink Floyd song "Keep Talking", and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons. )Tj
T*( In 1999 Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American )Tj
T*(Physical Society.[199] The same year, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to )Tj
T*(Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its )Tj
T*(revelations caused a sensation in the media, but as was his usual practice )Tj
T*(regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that )Tj
T*(he did not read biographies about himself. )Tj
T*( 2000 to present )Tj
T*( Following his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalized )Tj
T*(from his life.[201] Soon after turn of the century, and for a period of about )Tj
T*(five years, family and staff became increasingly worried that the scientist was )Tj
T*(being physically abused.[201] Police investigations took place, but were closed )Tj
T*(as Hawking refused to make a complaint.[203][201][204] )Tj
T*( Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe )Tj
T*(in a Nutshell in 2001, and A Briefer History of Time which he wrote in 2005 )Tj
T*(with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works to make them accessible to a )Tj

T*(Nuclear Research \(CERN\), in 2006 Hawking proposed a theory of "top-down )Tj

T*(therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the )Tj

T*(Hawking maintained his public profile with a series of attention-getting and )Tj

T*(outsmarted by computers, and that aliens likely exist and contact with them )Tj
T*(avoided.[225][226] Hawking has expressed his concerns that life on earth is )Tj
T*(risk due to "a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other )Tj
T*(dangers we have not yet thought of".[227] He views spaceflight and the )Tj
T*(colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity.[227][228] )Tj
T*(Motivated by an desire both to increase public interest in spaceflight and a )Tj

T*( The Queluz National Palace \(Portuguese: PalÃ¡cio Nacional de Queluz, Portuguese )Tj
T*(pronunciation:Â [kÉ›ËˆÉ«uÊƒ]\) is a Portuguese 18th-century palace located at Queluz, )Tj
T*(a freguesia of the modern-day Sintra Municipality, in the Lisbon District. One )Tj
T*(of the last great Rococo buildings to be designed in Europe,[1] the palace was )Tj
T*(conceived as a summer retreat for Dom Pedro of Braganza, later to become )Tj
T*(husband and then king consort to his own niece, Queen Maria I. It served as a )Tj
T*(discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness )Tj
T*(continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786. Following the )Tj
T*(destruction by fire of the Ajuda Palace in 1794, Queluz Palace became the )Tj
T*(official residence of the Portuguese prince regent, John VI, and his family and )Tj
T*(remained so until the Royal Family fled to Brazil in 1807 following the French )Tj
T*(invasion of Portugal.[2] )Tj
T*( Work on the palace began in 1747 under the architect Mateus Vicente de )Tj
T*(Oliveira. Despite being far smaller, the palace is often referred to as the )Tj
T*(Portuguese Versailles.[3] From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with )Tj
T*(the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. )Tj
T*(Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted the interior, the palace was )Tj
T*(extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist )Tj
T*(attraction. )Tj
T*( One wing of the palace, the Pavilion of Dona Maria, built between 1785 and )Tj
T*(1792 by the architect Manuel Caetano de Sousa, is now a guest house allocated )Tj
T*(to foreign heads of state visiting Portugal. )Tj
T*( [edit] Architecture and history )Tj
T*( Queluz's architecture is representative of the final extravagant period of )Tj
T*(Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690.[4] )Tj
T*(From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists and architects were )Tj
T*(employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy; )Tj
T*(they brought with them classical ideas of architecture which derived from the )Tj
T*(Renaissance. In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, )Tj
T*(Italian-influenced Baroque which preceded the Rococo style throughout )Tj

T*(Europe.[4] )Tj
T*( Comparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted: )Tj
T*(Versailles is referred to as having "an aura of majesty" and it was built and )Tj
T*(dedicated to exhibit in stone "all the glories of France,"[5] whereas the far )Tj
T*(smaller palace at Queluz has been described as "exquisite rather than )Tj
T*(magnificent" and looking like "a very expensive birthday cake".[6] In its )Tj
T*(frivolity, the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the )Tj
T*(Portuguese royal family at the time of building: during the reign of Dom )Tj
T*(Pedro's brother, Joseph I, when Portugal was in practice governed by a valido )Tj
T*(or favourite, the Marquis of Pombal. Pombal encouraged the royal family to )Tj
T*(while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him.[4] Thus )Tj
T*(the extravagant, almost whimsical architecture of Queluz, set apart from the )Tj
T*(capital city, exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal )Tj
T*(during this era, and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants.[4] )Tj
T*(Queluz's role as a haven for those without responsibility was, however, to be )Tj
T*(short-lived. )Tj
T*( On the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was )Tj
T*(dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the )Tj
T*(partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state )Tj
T*(in much the same way as Frederick the Great used Europe's other famed Rococo )Tj
T*(palace, Sanssouci.[7] )Tj
T*( The site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow.[8] It had )Tj
T*(originally been owned by the Marquess of Castelo Rodrigo. When the ruling )Tj
T*(Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the property was confiscated, and )Tj
T*(Rodrigo was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish. The estate and its )Tj
T*(hunting lodge then became one of the many properties of the Portuguese king, )Tj
T*(JoÃ£o IV. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son )Tj
T*(of the reigning monarch.[9] Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the )Tj
T*(second son of JoÃ£o V. )Tj
T*( The architect, Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, had trained under Ludovice of )Tj
T*(Ratisbon and Jean Baptiste Robillon[10] during the construction of the royal )Tj
T*(palace and convent of Mafra. The more sombre and massive classical palace at )Tj
T*(Mafra does not appear to have influenced the design for Queluz, which is in a )Tj
T*(lighter, more airy style.[1] Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until )Tj
T*(1755, when it was interrupted by the Great Earthquake of 1755, after which the )Tj
T*(labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city. The )Tj
T*(earthquake proved to be a catalyst, because the urban rebuilding process )Tj
T*(stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal.[4] The subsequent )Tj
T*(architecture of Queluz was influenced by new ideas and concepts. When work )Tj
T*(recommenced in 1758, the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake. )Tj
T*(Thus the later works take the form of low, long buildings, more structurally )Tj
T*(stable than a single high block: as a result, viewed from a distance the palace )Tj
T*(resembles long enfilades linked by higher pavilions rather than one single )Tj
T*(construction.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Exterior )Tj
T*( The public faÃ§ade of the palace faces directly onto a town square and takes )Tj
T*(the form of two low, symmetrical, quadrant wings which flank the )Tj
T*(forward-reaching wings of a small central corps de logis, thus forming a )Tj
T*(semi-circular cour d'honneur \(see key 1\). The southern of the two quadrant )Tj
T*(wings is terminated by the onion-domed chapel, while the northern wing )Tj
T*(contained the kitchens and servants' quarters \(see keys 2, 1 and 13\).[12] The )Tj
T*(only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows. )Tj
T*(This faÃ§ade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and )Tj
T*(impassive public face with one of the most architecturally severe elevations of )Tj
T*(the palace \(see illustration right\). )Tj
T*( Oliveira was directly responsible for the "Ceremonial FaÃ§ade" of the "corps de )Tj
T*(logis", the rectangular block which forms the nucleus of the palace, and some )Tj
T*(of the interior courtyards. His former tutor, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste )Tj
T*(Robillon, was in charge of the gardens, many buildings, and the Rococo )Tj
T*(interiors. He in turn was assisted by Jean-Baptiste Pillement and other French )Tj

T*(and Portuguese artists. The "Ceremonial FaÃ§ade" is the best-known view of the )Tj
T*(palace. With classical proportions, it is externally decorated by travertine )Tj
T*(rendering and delicately carved cartouches over the windows. It has been )Tj
T*(described as a "harmonious example of Portuguese Baroque".[9] This faÃ§ade with )Tj
T*(its single-storey flanking wings forms a three-sided courtyard containing the )Tj
T*("Hanging Garden"â€”so called because like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon it is on )Tj
T*(a raised terrace \(see key 5\). )Tj
T*( The second major part of the palace is the great western wing, known as the )Tj
T*(Robillon wing or Robillon Pavilion, which illustrates better than any other the )Tj
T*(excesses of Baroque and Rococo architecture \(see key 9\). Completed in 1779, it )Tj
T*(has a doric colonnade which runs the entire length of its western and southern )Tj
T*(faÃ§ades, the roof of which provides a balustraded balcony accessible from the )Tj
T*(floor above \(see key 10\). Owing to the topography of the site, the eastern side )Tj
T*(appears as a single-storey building, with only the upper floor visible above )Tj
T*(the ground in the "Hanging Garden". The balustrade on the roof of the Robillon )Tj
T*(wing is broken by heavy segmental pediments adorned with reclining statuary )Tj
T*(figures; the balustrade itself is also adorned with flambeaux, statuary and )Tj
T*(heavy armorial trophies \(see illustration below\). )Tj
T*( The Robillon wing contains an entrance to the palace reached by flights of )Tj
T*(ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a )Tj
T*(longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of )Tj
T*(exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight so as not to lead the eye and )Tj
T*(footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with )Tj
T*(elaborate statuary \(see key 11\). The bays of the faÃ§ade are stuccoed rose-pink, )Tj
T*(contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone \(see illustration\). )Tj
T*( In 1760, Pombal arranged for Dom Pedro to marry the king's unstable daughter )Tj
T*(Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple to live with )Tj
T*(their children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of )Tj
T*(government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their )Tj
T*(principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to )Tj
T*(reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, )Tj
T*(Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did )Tj
T*(not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered )Tj
T*(little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious )Tj
T*(matters.[13] )Tj
T*( By the death of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the interior work was completed.[14] )Tj
T*(This was fortunate, as from this period his widow's mental health deteriorated, )Tj
T*(until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at )Tj
T*(Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of )Tj
T*(her subjects. Her eldest son, later King JoÃ£o VI, was appointed Regent and )Tj
T*(ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.[15] )Tj
T*( In 2004, the World Monuments Fund began a program to restore the lead )Tj
T*(sculptures by British sculptor John Cheere, as well as some of the other )Tj
T*(features of the garden. The project is ongoing. )Tj
T*( [edit] Interior )Tj
T*( The interior of the palace received no less attention to detail and design )Tj
T*(than the exterior. French artisans were employed to decorate the rooms, many of )Tj
T*(which are small, their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and )Tj
T*(historical scenes. Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors, for )Tj
T*(a rustic appearance as well as coolness in hot weather.[1] The many tall )Tj
T*(pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series )Tj
T*(of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms. A predominant feature of )Tj
T*(the interiors is the azulejos: polychrome glazed tiles, often in a chinoiserie )Tj
T*(style with tones of blues and yellows contrasting with muted reds. Materials )Tj
T*(for use on the interior included stone imported from Genoa and woods from )Tj
T*(Brazil, Denmark and Sweden, while coloured marbles were imported from )Tj
T*(Italy.[17] Many of the palace's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934, )Tj
T*(and much was lost. )Tj

T*(the 1934 fire\) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels \(illustrated )Tj
T*(below\). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, all of which have )Tj
T*(been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large )Tj
T*(halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller )Tj
T*(rooms include the Gun Room \(where hunting parties would assemble\), which is a )Tj
T*(frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Music Room )Tj
T*( The Music Room \(illustrated below\) which follows the "Sala dos Embaixadores" )Tj
T*(is decorated with gilded and painted wood and was redesigned in 1768. The )Tj
T*(ceiling inset with painted cartouches is notable for the intricate ribbed )Tj
T*(scheme of its design, similar to that of the vestibule at Caserta.[16] The )Tj
T*(Music Room is decorated in a more neoclassical style than the other state )Tj
T*(rooms, reflecting its redesign in the period following the Baroque Rococo in )Tj
T*(the final half of the 18th century. This room was the setting for the large )Tj
T*(concerts for which the palace was famous.[18] The room still contains the )Tj
T*(Empire grand piano decorated with gilt appliques.[16] Above the piano hangs a )Tj
T*(Image:Sala de MÃºsica.jpg. Like many other rooms of the palace, the Music Room )Tj
T*(is lit by huge crystal chandeliers. )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] The Ball Room )Tj
T*( The Ballroom, the last of the palace's three largest rooms,[19] \(illustrated )Tj
T*(below\) was designed by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect )Tj
T*(combined five smaller rooms.[20] The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of )Tj
T*(heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been )Tj
T*(compared with that of FranÃ§ois de CuvilliÃ©s' Amalienburg at Schloss )Tj
T*(Nymphenburg.[18] The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, )Tj
T*(coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Hall of Ambassadors )Tj
T*( The Hall of Ambassadors \("Sala dos Embaixadores"\), sometimes called the throne )Tj
T*(room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 and is one of the )Tj
T*(largest reception rooms in the palace.[18] This long low room has a ceiling )Tj
T*(painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family )Tj
T*(attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely )Tj
T*(wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on )Tj
T*(both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above )Tj
T*(which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an )Tj
T*(apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a chequer )Tj
T*(board pattern of black and white marble tiles.[22] )Tj

T*( [edit] The Chapel )Tj
T*( During the occupancy of the palace by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was )Tj
T*(central to the daily routine of their court. It was no coincidence that the )Tj
T*(chapel was the first part of the palace to be completed and was consecrated as )Tj
T*(early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the )Tj
T*(reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. )Tj
T*(The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her )Tj
T*(husbandâ€”the couple attended mass several times a day.[13] Following Dom Pedro's )Tj
T*(death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions )Tj
T*(assumed the air of religious ceremonies.[13] Finally the Queen's instability )Tj
T*(and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity.[14] Queluz and its )Tj
T*(chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to )Tj
T*(flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de )Tj
T*(Janeiro in 1816. )Tj
T*( The chapel beneath its large onion dome is dark and cavernous and decorated )Tj
T*(with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, )Tj

T*( [edit] The private apartments )Tj
T*( The private rooms of the palace are far smaller and more intimate than the )Tj
T*(formal state rooms and contain many royal mementos and curios which belonged to )Tj
T*(the rooms' former occupants. Amongst the more remarkable rooms in this suite )Tj
T*(are the Sala das Merendas, the Queen's Boudoir and the King's Bedroom. )Tj
T*( [edit] Sala das Merendas )Tj
T*( This was the royal family's private dining room. The decoration continues the )Tj
T*(theme used in some of the more formal and public rooms, with tiled panels )Tj
T*(illustrating courtiers in sylvan poses. These panels, like much other work in )Tj
T*(the palace, were produced by JoÃ£o Valentim and JosÃ© Conrado Rosa.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Queen's Boudoir )Tj
T*( This was one of the private rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. )Tj
T*(It is designed in the form of a bower, with a trellis pattern on the ceiling )Tj
T*(which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor \(illustrated below\), )Tj
T*(giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior.[14] The )Tj
T*(marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate )Tj
T*(rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been )Tj
T*(damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and )Tj
T*(contain overdoor and mirror carouches by JosÃ© Conrado Rosa.[25] Next to the )Tj
T*(boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the )Tj
T*(demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited )Tj
T*(the palace in 1794.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] The King's Bedroom )Tj
T*( The King's Bedroom \(illustrated below\) has been described as one of the most )Tj
T*("fantastic" rooms in the palace.[14] Although actually square, it gives the )Tj
T*(illusion of being completely circular, with a domed ceiling supported by )Tj
T*(columns of mirrored glass. Between the columns are cartouches depicting scenes )Tj
T*(from the tales of Don Quixote. JoÃ£o VI died in this room in 1826. The room )Tj
T*(contains a large bust of the King showing his "pendulous jowls and unattractive )Tj
T*(face".[24] )Tj

T*( [edit] Grounds )Tj
T*( Queluz is famed for the glory of its gardens,[10] which include a large )Tj
T*(topiary parterre laid out in the manner of Le NÃ´tre at the rear of the palace )Tj
T*(\(see key 14\). The Flemish influences, including the canals, in the garden are )Tj
T*(the work of the Dutch gardener Gerald van der Kolk, who assisted Robillon from )Tj
T*(1760.[27] Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and )Tj
T*(fountains. The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the "Portico dos )Tj
T*(Cavalinhos", a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues )Tj
T*(depicting Fames, and two sphinxes \(see final illustration\) surreally dressed in )Tj
T*(18th-century costume, combining the formal and the fantastic.[28] This surreal )Tj
T*(theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the rape of the )Tj
T*(Sabines and the death of Abel alternate with statuary of donkeys dressed in )Tj
T*(human clothing. Deeper in the gardens is a grotto complete with a cascade. )Tj
T*(Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens, the Queluz cascade was the )Tj
T*(first artificial waterfall to be constructed near Lisbon.[28] )Tj
T*( An avenue of huge magnolias forms the approach to the classical Robillon wing )Tj
T*(of the palace \(see key 7\), while from the wing a double staircase leads to the )Tj
T*(canal. More than 100Â metres \(330Â ft\) long, the walls of the canal are decorated )Tj
T*(with tiled panels depicting seascapes and associated scenes. This is the )Tj
T*(largest of a series of canals in the gardens bordered with chinoiserie-style )Tj
T*(azulejo tiles. Fed by a stream, the sluice gates to the canals are only opened )Tj
T*(in May. During the 18th century, the canals were the setting for fÃªtes )Tj
T*(champÃªtres during which fully rigged ships would sail in processions with )Tj

T*(figures aboard in allegorical costumes.[29] )Tj
T*( The gardens also contain a fountain with tritons and dolphins which has been )Tj
T*(attributed to Bernini.[30] There are further fountains and statuary in the )Tj
T*(lower gardens, set within tall hedges of yew and cypress, and magnolia and )Tj
T*(mulberry trees planted by Marshal Junot during the French occupation in the )Tj
T*(Napoleonic wars.[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later history )Tj
T*( Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and )Tj
T*(his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing )Tj
T*(was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine )Tj
T*(children.[32] These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934.[32] To escape )Tj
T*(the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz )Tj
T*(and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, )Tj
T*(and their commander, Marshal Junot, made several alterations to the )Tj
T*(building.[14] On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King )Tj
T*(preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta )Tj
T*(Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita.[32] )Tj
T*(The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that )Tj
T*(JoÃ£o VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.[15] )Tj
T*( Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister,[33] is said to have been )Tj
T*(ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in )Tj
T*(stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, )Tj
T*(employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in )Tj
T*(Europe.[24] The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which )Tj
T*(nothing remains today.[24] She died at the palace in 1830.[24] )Tj
T*( Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as )Tj
T*(a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royals. )Tj
T*(Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil )Tj
T*(war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV,[32] before being forced )Tj
T*(by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV )Tj
T*(died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro )Tj
T*(I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her )Tj
T*(son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the )Tj
T*(throne passed to his brother LuÃ­s. From this time the royal family lived )Tj
T*(chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the assassination of LuÃ­s' )Tj
T*(son Carlos I in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. )Tj
T*(Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the monarchy fell two years )Tj
T*(later. )Tj
T*( [edit] Queluz, National Monument )Tj
T*( In the 21st century, the palace gardens, once an irrigated oasis in the centre )Tj
T*(of parched farmland, are bounded by the "Radial de Sintra" motorway which feeds )Tj
T*(traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra. However, transportation and )Tj
T*(tourism have been the saviours of the palace. Since 1940 it has been open to )Tj
T*(the public as a museum. It houses much of the former royal collection, )Tj
T*(including furniture, Arraiolos carpets, paintings, and Chinese and European )Tj
T*(ceramics and porcelain.[2] )Tj
T*( In 1957, the "Dona Maria Pavilion" in the palace's east wing was transformed )Tj
T*(into a guest house for visiting heads of state.[2] Today the palace's principal )Tj
T*(rooms are therefore not simply museums, but the setting for official )Tj
T*(entertaining. )Tj
T*( The town square that the palace faces, "Largo do PalÃ¡cio de Queluz", remains )Tj
T*(relatively unaltered since the 18th century. The large houses, once the homes )Tj
T*(of courtiers, and the former Royal Guard quarters with its campanile are still )Tj
T*(clustered around the palace. In latter years, the town of Queluz has expanded )Tj
T*(considerably to become one of the suburbs of Lisbon. The Palace of Queluz is )Tj
T*(one of Lisbon's many tourist attractions. )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( For a statistical breakdown by season, see Dover Athletic F.C. seasons)Tj
T*(  Dover Athletic F.C. was formed in 1983 after the town's previous club, Dover, )Tj
T*(folded due to its debts. The new club took Dover's place in the Southern League )Tj
T*(Southern Division,[2] with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team )Tj
T*(consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club.[5] Initially Athletic )Tj
T*(struggled, finishing second from bottom of the table in the 1984â€“85 season.[5] )Tj
T*(In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was )Tj
T*(sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.[5] )Tj
T*( Under Kinnear the club's fortunes turned round, with two top-five finishes )Tj
T*(followed by the Southern Division championship, and with it promotion, in the )Tj
T*(1987â€“88 season. The team started strongly in the Premier Division, finishing in )Tj
T*(sixth place at the first attempt, and then winning the championship in the )Tj
T*(1989â€“90 season.[7] The club was denied promotion to the Football Conference, )Tj
T*(however, as the Crabble Athletic Ground did not meet the standard required for )Tj
T*(that league.[2] After finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two )Tj
T*(seasons, Dover won the title again in the 1992â€“93 season and this time were )Tj
T*(admitted to the Conference.[7] )Tj
T*( Although Dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the )Tj
T*(Conference,[8] the following season saw the club struggling against relegation, )Tj
T*(and Kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team's poor performances )Tj
T*(and his own personal problems.[5][9]John Ryan was appointed as the club's new )Tj
T*(manager,[10] but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club )Tj
T*(lost seven of its first eight matches in the 1995â€“96 season.[11] The club then )Tj
T*(appointed former England international Peter Taylor as manager, but he was )Tj
T*(unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto )Tj
T*(their place in the Conference only because Northern Premier League runners-up )Tj
T*(Boston United failed to submit their application for promotion before the )Tj
T*(required deadline.[11] )Tj
T*( Bill Williams took over as manager in 1997 and proved to be Dover's most )Tj
T*(successful Conference manager, leading the club to the FA Trophy semi-finals in )Tj
T*(the 1997â€“98 season and a best ever league finish of sixth place in the )Tj
T*(1999â€“2000 season.[7][12] Williams left the club to take a senior position with )Tj
T*(Conference rivals Kingstonian in May 2001.[12] By now the club was in severe )Tj
T*(financial difficulties, with a number of directors resigning and debts )Tj
T*(exceeding Â£100,000. Amid the crisis the entire board of directors resigned, )Tj
T*(forcing the club's Supporters' Trust to take over the running of the club,[13] )Tj
T*(and manager Gary Bellamy was sacked after just six months in the job.[14][15] )Tj
T*(Former Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall took over but was dismissed just )Tj
T*(three months later, with Clive Walker taking over in March 2002 with the club )Tj
T*(rooted to the foot of the table.[16] The club finished the season bottom of the )Tj
T*(Conference and was relegated back to the Southern League Premier Division.[17] )Tj
T*(The club's ongoing financial problems led to it entering a Company Voluntary )Tj
T*(Arrangement \(CVA\), a process by which insolvent companies offset their debts )Tj
T*(against future profits, due to debts that were now estimated at Â£400,000.[18] )Tj
T*( In Dover's first season back in the Southern League Premier Division the )Tj
T*(Whites finished in third place, albeit 17Â points adrift of Tamworth, who )Tj

T*(season in 19th place, before being switched to the Isthmian League Premier )Tj
T*(Division in the summer of 2004 following a re-organisation of the English )Tj

T*( This article is about the England-born actor and entomologist. For the )Tj
T*(American entomologist, see William Henry Edwards. )Tj
T*( Henry Edwards \(August 27, 1827 â€“ June 9, 1891\), known as "Harry", was an )Tj
T*(English-born stage actor, writer and entomologist who gained fame in Australia, )Tj
T*(San Francisco and New York City for his theater work. )Tj
T*( Edwards was drawn to the theater early in life, and he appeared in amateur )Tj
T*(productions in London. After sailing to Australia, Edwards appeared )Tj
T*(professionally in Shakespearean plays and light comedies primarily in Melbourne )Tj
T*(and Sydney. Throughout his childhood in England and his acting career in )Tj
T*(Australia, he was greatly interested in collecting insects, and the National )Tj
T*(Museum of Victoria used the results of his Australian fieldwork as part of the )Tj
T*(genesis of their collection. )Tj
T*( In San Francisco, Edwards was a founding member of the Bohemian Club, and a )Tj
T*(gathering in Edwards' honor was the spark which began the club's traditional )Tj
T*(summer encampment at the Bohemian Grove.[3] As well, Edwards cemented his )Tj
T*(reputation as a preeminent stage actor and theater manager. After writing a )Tj
T*(series of influential studies on Pacific Coast butterflies and moths he was )Tj
T*(elected life member of the California Academy of Sciences. Relocating to the )Tj
T*(East Coast, Edwards spent a brief time in Boston theater. This led to a )Tj
T*(connection to Wallack's Theatre and further renown in New York City. There, )Tj
T*(Edwards edited three volumes of the journal Papilio and published a major work )Tj
T*(about the life of the butterfly.[2] His large collection of insect specimens )Tj
T*(served as the foundation of the American Museum of Natural History's butterfly )Tj
T*(and moth studies. )Tj
T*( Edwards' wide-ranging studies and observations of insects brought him into )Tj
T*(contact with specimens not yet classified. Upon discovering previously unknown )Tj
T*(insects he would give them names, which led to a number of butterfly, moth and )Tj

T*(beetle species bearing "Hy. Edw." \(for Henry Edwards\) as an attribution.[4] )Tj
T*(From his theater interests to entomology, Edwards carried forward an )Tj
T*(appreciation of Shakespeareâ€”in the designation of new insect species he favored )Tj
T*(female character names from Shakespeare's plays. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early career )Tj
T*( Henry Edwards was born to Hannah and Thomas Edwards \(c. 1794â€“1857\) at Brook )Tj
T*(House in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England, on August 27, 1827, and was )Tj
T*(christened on September 14.[5] From his older brother William, he picked up an )Tj
T*(interest in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied )Tj
T*(them under the tutelage of Edward Doubleday. His solicitor father intended a )Tj
T*(law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards )Tj
T*(took a position at a counting house in London, and began acting in amateur )Tj
T*(theater. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in )Tj
T*(Australia, nine miles \(14Â km\) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of Merri )Tj
T*(Creek, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship Ganges from )Tj
T*(March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the albatross )Tj
T*(that he encountered for the first time.[5] After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards )Tj
T*(began collecting and cataloging the insects he found on his brother's land, and )Tj
T*(further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, )Tj
T*(shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens.[5] This )Tj
T*(collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by Frederick McCoy to )Tj
T*(form the nucleus of the new National Museum of Victoria.[5] )Tj
T*( The first Australian stage appearance by Edwards was with George Selth )Tj
T*(Coppin's company at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. Later, he joined Gustavus )Tj
T*(Vaughan Brooke's theatrical group. The part of Petruchio, the male lead in )Tj
T*(Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, was filled by Edwards at the Princess's )Tj
T*(Theatre in Sydney in November, 1859, playing opposite tragedian Avonia Jones as )Tj
T*(Katharine.[6] In December that year Brooke retired from management, yielding )Tj
T*(the reins of his company to the team of Edwards and George Fawcett Rowe, )Tj
T*(English actor and playwright. Brooke continued to act under Edwards and Rowe: )Tj
T*(his starring performance in April 1860 as Louis XI in Dion Boucicault's play of )Tj
T*(the same name was a stirring portrayal that Edwards, playing Jacques )Tj
T*(d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, recalled vividly for the rest of his life.[6] )Tj
T*(Sharing the stage again in August, Brooke and Edwards were well received in )Tj
T*(their portrayal of twin brothers in a production of Shakespeare's The Comedy of )Tj
T*(Errors in Melbourne, the first Australian mounting of that work.[6] As a twist )Tj
T*(to pique public interest, Edwards and Brooke exchanged roles after two weeks' )Tj
T*(run. However, not all of Edwards' performances were successful: his turn at )Tj
T*(Angelo in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure was called "invertebrate"[6] by )Tj
T*(drama critic William John Lawrence; in Lawrence's estimation, Edwards and his )Tj
T*(fellow actors paled against the powerful performance of Avonia Jones as )Tj
T*(Isabella.[6] )Tj
T*( The renowned entomologist and collector William Sharp Macleay was sought out )Tj
T*(by Edwards whenever his stage appearances took him to Sydney. Beginning in )Tj
T*(1858, Macleay mentored Edwards and encouraged him to search for more insect )Tj
T*(specimens when his theater obligations allowed. Robust and adventuresome, )Tj
T*(Edwards occasionally trekked out into the wilds of Australia on the hunt for )Tj
T*(insects. While in Sydney, Edwards went up two times in a hot air balloon as a )Tj
T*(favor to George Coppin, narrowly avoiding severe injury or death in the first )Tj
T*(ascent.[7] Edwards' further travels included New Zealand,[8] Peru, Panama and )Tj
T*(Mexico in pursuit of insects and dramatic roles.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] San Francisco )Tj
T*( In 1865, Edwards began a 12-year residence in San Francisco, California. At )Tj
T*(the 1870 United States Census, Edwards reported himself as a non-voting )Tj
T*(foreign-born resident, a comedian by trade, living in a home worth $1,000.[9] )Tj
T*(Edwards lived in San Francisco with a white woman listed in the census as )Tj
T*("Mariana", born in England, age 40, and a 16-year-old Chinese servant named )Tj
T*(Heng Gim.[9] The woman Mariana was likely Edwards's wife,[10] the former )Tj
T*(Marianne Elizabeth Woolcott Bray who was born about 1822â€“1823 in New Street, )Tj
T*(Birmingham.[6] In 1851 at the age of 28, Bray married Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, )Tj

T*(and the two went to Australia to manage Brooke's then-new theater company. It )Tj
T*(was there that Edwards met Brooke and his wife, but after several years of the )Tj
T*(two men working together, Brooke remarried in February 1863, taking Avonia )Tj
T*(Jones \(1836â€“1867\)[11] as his second wife. Brooke died in an accident at sea in )Tj
T*(January 1866, and Avonia Jones Brooke died in New York City the next year.[12] )Tj
T*(Later reports spoke of Edwards marrying Brooke's widow, without naming her.[10] )Tj
T*( In 1868â€“1869 Edwards leased and managed the Metropolitan Theater,[13] and he )Tj
T*(was a founding member of the acting company of the California Theatre, which )Tj
T*(opened in January 1869.[14] The theater was directed and managed by actor John )Tj
T*(McCullough, and among the more notable productions was As You Like It in May )Tj
T*(1872, with McCullough playing Orlando and Edwards the banished Duke Senior. )Tj
T*(Walter M. Leman, who carried the part of Adam, opined in 1886 that "never since )Tj
T*(time was has Shakespeare's charming idyl been better put upon the stage."[15] )Tj
T*( Edwards was one of the founders and the first vice president of the Bohemian )Tj
T*(Club, and served two terms as president, 1873â€“1875.[16] He hosted Shakespeare )Tj
T*(celebrations at the club in April 1873, 1875 and 1877, and a Bohemian Christmas )Tj
T*(celebration in December 1877: "The Feast of Reason and Flow of Soul".[17] )Tj
T*(Edwards became a director of the San Francisco Art Association, and spoke for )Tj
T*(Lotta Crabtree at the dedication of Lotta's Fountain in September, 1875.[13] )Tj
T*( Still very much interested in insects, Edwards spent his spare time at the )Tj
T*(California Academy of Sciences studying butterflies under Hans Hermann Behr, )Tj
T*(the academy's curator for Lepidoptera, the scientific order of moths and )Tj
T*(butterflies.[4] Elected a member of the academy in 1867, he concentrated on )Tj
T*(describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the Pacific )Tj
T*(coast from British Columbia to Baja California. He went to visit John Muir in )Tj
T*(Yosemite Valley in June 1871, with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr, )Tj
T*(the wife of California's chief geologist Ezra S. Carr. The letter described )Tj
T*(Edwards as "one of Nature's truest and most devoted disciples", a sojourner who )Tj
T*("has the keys to the Kingdom".[18] After the visit, Muir occasionally sent )Tj
T*(specimens from the Sierras to add to Edwards' collection, carried to San )Tj
T*(Francisco by men such as geologist and artist Clarence King who were returning )Tj
T*(from Yosemite field study. Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy )Tj
T*(entitled Pacific Coast Lepidoptera,[13] and classified two species as new to )Tj
T*(science. He named one Gyros muiri for Muir, with "Hy. Edw." as the )Tj
T*(attribution.[19] In 1872, Muir sent Edwards a letter, writing "You are now in )Tj
T*(constant remembrance, because every flying flower is branded with your )Tj
T*(name."[4] In 1873, Edwards became the curator of entomology at the academy, and )Tj
T*(began to serve on the Publications Committee which produced the journal )Tj
T*(Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences. Beginning early that year, )Tj
T*(he accompanied and befriended George Robert Crotch on the latter's )Tj
T*(insect-collecting tour of California, Oregon and British Columbia. In 1874, )Tj
T*(Edwards began to serve as one of the academy's vice presidents, and for the )Tj
T*(academy in late 1874 after Crotch's death from tuberculosis, he published a )Tj
T*(memorial tribute to the man.[20] Edwards also wrote one of many tributes to )Tj
T*(academician Louis Agassiz at his death in late 1873. At the academy on January )Tj
T*(2, 1877, Edwards was elected member for life.[21] )Tj
T*( Though successful in San Francisco, Edwards decided to head for Boston and New )Tj
T*(York City to see if his career as an actor could benefit from appearances in )Tj
T*(the eastern United States.[22] On June 29, 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 of his )Tj
T*(Bohemian friends gathered in the woods near Taylorville, California )Tj
T*(\(present-day Samuel P. Taylor State Park\), for a night-time send-off party in )Tj
T*(Edwards' honor.[23] Bohemian Club historian Porter Garnett later wrote that the )Tj
T*(men at the "nocturnal picnic" were "provided with blankets to keep them warm )Tj
T*(and a generous supply of liquor for the same purpose".[3] Japanese lanterns )Tj
T*(were used for illumination and decoration. This festive gathering was repeated )Tj
T*(without Edwards by club members the next year, and every year thereafter, )Tj
T*(eventually evolving and expanding into the club's annual summer encampment at )Tj
T*(the Bohemian Grove,[3] famous \(or infamous\) for the casual commingling of top )Tj
T*(politicians and powerful captains of industry in attendance.[24] )Tj

T*( In late 1878, Edwards joined a theater company in Boston, replacing another )Tj
T*(actor as "Schelm, Chief of Police" at a revival of the spectacle The Exiles at )Tj
T*(the Boston Theatre on Washington Street.[25] After a four-week run, he )Tj
T*(performed in other productions at the theater through the 1879â€“1880 season.[26] )Tj
T*(In June, Edwards answered the 1880 census to report himself an England-born )Tj
T*(actor living with his English wife "Marian" and his Chinese servant, Gim )Tj
T*(Hing.[27] )Tj
T*( From Boston, Edwards moved to New York to stay for some ten years, performing )Tj
T*(on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in the Brooklyn and )Tj
T*(New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly )Tj
T*(enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the )Tj
T*(swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae.[4] Edwards served as editor until )Tj
T*(January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of )Tj
T*(Philadelphia.[28]Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base )Tj
T*(was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the )Tj
T*(Brooklyn Entomological Society. )Tj
T*( Beginning in December 1880 under Lester Wallack, the charismatic son of the )Tj
T*(theater's founder, Edwards was associated with Wallack's Theatre in New York, )Tj
T*(called the "finest theatre company in America".[29] Now in his 50s, the )Tj
T*(entomologist and actor appeared in such representative British dramatic roles )Tj
T*(as Prince Malleotti in Forget Me Not, Max Harkaway in London Assurance, Baron )Tj
T*(Stein in Diplomacy, and Master Walter in The Hunchback, reprising James )Tj
T*(Sheridan Knowles's earlier portrayal. Edwards used Wallack's Theatre as his )Tj
T*(professional mailing address, and helped manage it upon occasion. Wallack, )Tj
T*(already head "Shepherd" of the Lambs Club, a modest meetinghouse of )Tj
T*(professional stage actors, invited Edwards to join.[30] Once a Lamb, Edwards )Tj
T*(threw his energies in with those of Wallack and other club members to aid )Tj
T*(newspaper editor Harrison Grey Fiske in the organization of a charitable fund )Tj
T*(to support destitute actors or their widows. Wallack was made president of the )Tj
T*(resulting Actors' Fund. A year after its first meeting on July 15, 1882 at )Tj
T*(Wallack's Theatre, Edwards was made secretary, a position he held for one year. )Tj
T*(His wife joined the Women's Executive Committee of the Fund.[31] )Tj
T*( Edwards appeared in early 1882 at Palmer's Theatre on Broadway and West 30th )Tj
T*(Street in a production of the English comedy The School for Scandal. Wallack )Tj
T*(stalwart John Gibbs Gilbert reached the height of his fame in the production, )Tj
T*(playing Sir Peter Teazle. As Sir Oliver Surface, Edwards, too, was )Tj
T*(laudedâ€”Gilbert and Edwards shared the stage with Stella Boniface, Osmond )Tj
T*(Tearle, Gerald Eyre, Madame Ponisi and Rose Coghlan.[32] )Tj
T*( Gathering together under one cover his various short subjects, essays, and )Tj
T*(elegies to fallen friends, Edwards published in 1883 a wryly humorous book )Tj
T*(entitled A Mingled Yarn, including tales of travels and stories of his time in )Tj
T*(the Bohemian Club. Dedicated to the Bohemians, "with grateful memories, and )Tj
T*(feelings of affectionate regard,"[33] the book was favorably reviewed in the )Tj
T*(New York Tribune. This review was reprinted in the Literary News: "Mr. )Tj
T*(Edwardsâ€”remarkable for attainments in science no less than for versatile )Tj
T*(proficiency in the art of actingâ€”presents a rare type of the union of talents )Tj
T*(greatly divergent and seldom found in one and the same person."[34] )Tj
T*( In 1886, Edwards was interviewed for The Theatre, a weekly magazine published )Tj
T*(in New York. Edwards was described as "unusually popular and genial", with a )Tj
T*("charming English" wife and a Chinese servant named Charlie who "adores his )Tj
T*(employers" and had served them for 17 years.[35] The Edwards' home was observed )Tj
T*(to be comfortable but decorated with an astonishing collection of wonders from )Tj
T*(around the globe. Displayed amid the biological specimens, rugs, china, )Tj
T*(furniture, and valuable photographs were paintings executed by other actors, )Tj
T*(including ones by Edward Askew Sothern and Joseph Jefferson. Edwards showed )Tj
T*(letters he had received from a wide array of notables such as writers William )Tj
T*(Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and naturalists Charles )Tj
T*(Darwin, Louis Agassiz and John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. One floor of the )Tj
T*(residence was seen to be wholly devoted to the entomologist's collection of )Tj
T*(specimens, which Edwards said was insured for $17,000,[35] $440,000 in current )Tj

T*(value. Surrounded by his exotic possessions and "in the most perfect )Tj
T*(congeniality with his wife", Edwards was reported to be the host of a )Tj
T*("cultivated home".[35] )Tj
T*( [edit] Last years )Tj
T*( Two years after Alfred, Lord Tennyson, completed his Idylls of the King, a )Tj
T*(poetic telling of the King Arthur legend, Edwards and George Parsons Lathrop )Tj
T*(adapted it to the stage as a drama in four acts. The result was Elaine, a story )Tj
T*(of young love between Elaine of Astolat and Lancelot, fashioned with )Tj
T*("flower-like fragility" and "winning touches of tenderness".[36] Its first )Tj
T*(public presentation was a staged "author's reading" at Madison Square Theatre )Tj
T*(on April 28, 1887, at which Edwards played the part of Elaine's father, Lord )Tj
T*(Astolat.[37] Months later it was presented by the company of A. M. Palmer, )Tj
T*(without Edwards in the cast, opening on December 6, 1887, at the same venue. )Tj
T*(The production proved both popular and profitable for Lathrop and )Tj
T*(Edwards.[38]Annie Russell's Elaine was admired for her "sweet simplicity and )Tj
T*(pathos which captured nearly every heart".[39] After a successful six-week New )Tj
T*(York run, Palmer took Elaine on the road.[36][38] )Tj
T*( Actors associated with Wallack's Theatre announced to the public that )Tj
T*(beginning in February 1888 a final series of old comedies would be revived, )Tj
T*(after which the company would be disbanded.[36] Edwards served as stage manager )Tj
T*(for the run, and reprised several of his earlier roles including those of Max )Tj
T*(Harkaway in London Assurance and Colonel Rockett in Old Heads and Young )Tj
T*(Hearts.[40] Taking part once again in The School for Scandal, the sixth and )Tj
T*(final play of the nostalgic series, Edwards received high praise for his )Tj
T*(depiction of a wealthy Englishman recently returned from India: "there is )Tj
T*(probably no better Sir Oliver on our stage than Mr. Edwards."[36] "Justly )Tj
T*(esteemed"[10] in the role, he was called a "sterling player", representative )Tj
T*("of a school which is fast disappearing".[36] )Tj
T*( A testimonial production of Hamlet was mounted at the Metropolitan Opera House )Tj
T*(on May 21, 1888, to celebrate the life and accomplishments of an aging Lester )Tj
T*(Wallack, and to raise money to ease the chronic sciatica that arrested his )Tj
T*(career. "One of the greatest casts ever assembled"[29] was formed into a )Tj
T*(company composed of Edwards as the priest, Edwin Booth as Hamlet, Lawrence )Tj
T*(Barrett as the ghost, Frank Mayo as the king, John Gibbs Gilbert as Polonius, )Tj
T*(Rose Coghlan as the player queen and Helena Modjeska as Ophelia. Other stars )Tj
T*(made cameo appearances, and Wallack was assisted up onto the stage to address )Tj
T*(the standing room crowd at intermission. Notables such as Mayor Hewitt and )Tj
T*(General Sherman were in attendance. More than $10,000 was raised for Wallack's )Tj
T*(care. In the following months, Edwards teamed with other actors and Wallack's )Tj
T*(wife to help him write his memoir;[41] Wallack died in September.[29] )Tj
T*( The next year, Edwards published a significant treatise entitled Bibliographic )Tj
T*(Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera.[4] In )Tj
T*(response to an invitation and after arranging a business contract, he traveled )Tj
T*(back to Australia to accept a position as stage manager of a theatrical company )Tj
T*(in Melbourne. Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York )Tj
T*(the next year with the intention of returning to acting, but poor health kept )Tj
T*(him from full enjoyment of the limelight. In March, Edwards appeared as )Tj
T*(Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was )Tj
T*(often short of breath and unable to keep pace with the runâ€”his part was given )Tj
T*(to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver )Tj
T*(Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.[10] )Tj
T*( To regain his strength, Edwards and his wife took a carriage to a rustic )Tj
T*(cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food )Tj
T*(and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed )Tj
T*(Mrs. Edwards that there would be no recovery for her husband from the advanced )Tj
T*(Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia[10] so she brought )Tj
T*(him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in )Tj
T*(East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.[4] )Tj

T*(years.[45]William Schaus, a student that Edwards guided and encouraged, but )Tj
T*(never met in person,[5] went on to further define moth and butterfly )Tj
T*(characteristics in a large body of published work.[4] )Tj
T*(  )Tj
T*(The "Hy. Edw." designation appended to some butterfly species names indicates )Tj
T*(first description by Henry Edwards. This is not to be confused with the "Edw." )Tj
T*(designation which stands for William Henry Edwards, an unrelated contemporary )Tj
T*(and correspondent of Edwards'.[4] At least two specimens were designated "Mrs. )Tj
T*(Hy. Edwards." because they were collected and identified by his wife.[46][47] )Tj
T*(Edwards named many butterflies in the families Theclinae, Nymphalidae, )Tj
T*(Papilionidae and Lycaenidae, but his largest contribution was in the )Tj
T*(description of moth species in North America including Mexico: Arctiidae, )Tj
T*(Bombycidae, Hepialidae, Sesiidae, Noctuidae, Sphingidae, Lasiocampidae, )Tj
T*(Dalceridae, Dysderidae, Geometridae, Pyralidae, Saturniidae, Thyatiridae, )Tj
T*(Urodidae and Zygaenidae.[8] In choosing names, Edwards favored female )Tj
T*(characters from the plays of William Shakespeare, such as Ophelia from Hamlet, )Tj
T*(Hermia from A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Desdemona from Othello.[48] For )Tj
T*(example, Edwards collected, classified and named the moth species Catocala )Tj
T*(ophelia[49] and Catocala hermia in 1880,[50] and Catocala desdemona in )Tj
T*(1882.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Birth dates )Tj
T*( The birth date that Edwards gave as his own varied depending on the time and )Tj
T*(place he was asked. Parish records show he was christened in England on )Tj
T*(September 14, 1827, and corroborating this date he gave his age as 25 in June )Tj
T*(1853 when he first arrived in Australia.[5] However, when questioned in San )Tj
T*(Francisco for the 1870 United States Census, he gave his birth year as )Tj
T*(1830.[9]Ten years later in Boston, he reported his age as 45,[9] implying a )Tj
T*(birth year of 1835, but he returned to supplying the year 1830 along with the )Tj

T*( The Flag of Portugal \(Portuguese: Bandeira de Portugal\) is the national flag )Tj
T*(of the Portuguese Republic. It is a rectangular bicolour with a field unevenly )Tj
T*(divided into green on the hoist, and red on the fly. The lesser version of the )Tj
T*(national coat of arms \(i.e. armillary sphere and Portuguese shield\) is centred )Tj
T*(over the colour boundary at equal distance from the upper and lower edges. On )Tj
T*(June 30, 1911, less than a year after the downfall of the constitutional )Tj
T*(monarchy, this design was officially adopted for the new national flag, after )Tj
T*(selection by a special commission whose members included Columbano Bordalo )Tj
T*(Pinheiro, JoÃ£o Chagas and Abel Botelho. )Tj
T*( The conjugation of the new field colours, especially the use of green, was not )Tj
T*(traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a )Tj
T*(radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former )Tj
T*(religious monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on January )Tj
T*(31, 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese )Tj
T*(Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept )Tj
T*(growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican )Tj
T*(revolution of October 5, 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were )Tj
T*(popularly propagandized as representing the hope of the nation \(green\) and the )Tj
T*(blood \(red\) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a )Tj
T*(more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. )Tj
T*( The current flag design represents a dramatic change in the evolution of the )Tj
T*(Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal )Tj
T*(arms. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the blueÂ )Tj
T*(cross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal )Tj
T*(monarchy's arms over a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes )Tj
T*(associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into )Tj
T*(the current design. )Tj
T*( [edit] Design )Tj
T*( The decree that legally replaced the flag used under the constitutional )Tj
T*(monarchy with the new design was approved by the Constituent Assembly and )Tj
T*(published in government diary no. 141 \(Portuguese: diÃ¡rio do Governo\), on June )Tj
T*(19, 1911. On June 30, this decree had its regulations officially published in )Tj

T*(\(without the laurel wreaths\)â€”a white-rimmed national shield on top of a )Tj

T*(both colours. )Tj
T*( The armillary sphere has a diameter equal to 1â„2 width and is equidistant from )Tj
T*(the upper and lower edges of the flag.[1] The sphere, drawn in perspective, )Tj
T*(possesses six edge-embossed arcs, four of which are great circles and two are )Tj
T*(small circles. The great circles represent the ecliptic \(wider oblique arc\), )Tj
T*(the equator, and two meridians. These last three are positioned so that the )Tj
T*(intersections between each two arcs make a right angle; one meridian lies on )Tj
T*(the flag's plane while the other is perpendicular to it. The small circles )Tj
T*(consist of two parallels \(the tropics\), each tangent to one of the )Tj
T*(ecliptic-meridian intersections.[2] )Tj
T*( Vertically centred over the sphere is the national shield, a white-rimmed )Tj
T*(curved bottom red shield charged with a white inescutcheon. Its height and )Tj
T*(width are equal to 7â„10 and 6â„10 of the sphere's diameter, respectively. The )Tj
T*(shield is positioned in a way that its limits intersect the sphere:[2] )Tj
T*( at the inflection points of the distal edges of the Tropic of Cancer's )Tj

T*(at the intersection of the lower edges of the ecliptic's posterior half and of )Tj

T*(at the intersection of the upper edge of the ecliptic's anterior half with the )Tj
T*(lower edge of the equator's posterior half \(sinister or viewer's right side\).)Tj
T*(  A curious aspect of the official design is the absence of a segment of the )Tj

T*( The white inescutcheon is itself charged with five smaller blue shields )Tj

T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( The Republican revolution of October 5, 1910, brought a need to replace the )Tj
T*(symbols of the overthrown monarchy, represented in the first instance by the )Tj
T*(old national flag and anthem. The choice of the new flag was not one without )Tj
T*(conflict, especially over the colours, as partisans of the republican )Tj
T*(red-and-green faced opposition from supporters of the traditional royal )Tj
T*(blue-and-white. Blue also carried a strong religious meaning as it was the )Tj
T*(colour of Our Lady of the Conception \(Portuguese: Nossa Senhora da ConceiÃ§Ã£o\), )Tj
T*(who was crowned Queen and Patroness of Portugal by King John IV, so its removal )Tj
T*(or replacement from the future flag was justified by Republicans as one of the )Tj
T*(many measures needed to secularize the state.[3] )Tj
T*( After the presentation and discussion of the many proposals,[4] a governmental )Tj
T*(commission was set up on October 15, 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo )Tj
T*(Pinheiro \(painter\), JoÃ£o Chagas \(journalist\), Abel Botelho \(writer\) and two )Tj
T*(military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla.[3] This commission )Tj
T*(ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, )Tj
T*(delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons,[5] which disguised the )Tj
T*(political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present )Tj
T*(on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of January )Tj
T*(31, 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in )Tj
T*(Lisbon.[6] )Tj
T*( The commission considered that red should "\(...\) be present as one of the main )Tj
T*(colours, because it is the battling, warm, virile colour, par excellence. It is )Tj
T*(the colour of conquest and laughter. A singing, burning, joyful colour \(...\) )Tj
T*(Recalls the idea of blood and urges to achieve victory". An explanation for the )Tj
T*(inclusion of the green was harder to come up with, given that it was not a )Tj
T*(traditional colour of the Portuguese flag's history. Eventually, it was )Tj
T*(justified on the grounds that, during the 1891 insurrection, this was the )Tj
T*(colour present on the revolutionary flag that "sparked the redeeming lightning" )Tj
T*(of republicanism. Finally, white \(on the shield\) represented "a beautiful and )Tj
T*(fraternal colour, into which all other colours merge themselves, colour of )Tj
T*(simplicity, of harmony and peace", adding that "\(...\) it is this same colour )Tj
T*(that, charged with enthusiasm and faith by the red cross of Christ, marks the )Tj
T*(Discoveries epic cycle".[5] )Tj
T*( The Manueline armillary sphere, which had been present on the national flag )Tj
T*(under the reign of John VI, was revived because it consecrated the "Portuguese )Tj
T*(epic maritime history \(...\) the ultimate challenge, essential to our collective )Tj
T*(life.". The Portuguese shield was kept, being positioned over the armillary )Tj
T*(sphere. Its presence would immortalize the "human miracle of positive bravery, )Tj
T*(tenacity, diplomacy, and audacity, that managed to bind the first links of the )Tj
T*(Portuguese nation's social and political affirmation", since it is one of the )Tj
T*("most vigorous symbols of the national identity and integrity".[5] )Tj
T*( The new flag was produced in large numbers at the Cordoaria Nacional \(English: )Tj

T*(National Rope House\) and was officially presented nationwide on December 1, )Tj
T*(1910, on occasion of the 270 years of the Restoration of Independence. This day )Tj
T*(had already been declared by the government as the "Flag Day" \(currently not )Tj
T*(celebrated\). In the capital, it was paraded from the city hall to the )Tj
T*(Restauradores \(English: Restorers\) Monument, where it was hoisted. This festive )Tj
T*(presentation did not mask, however, the turmoil caused by a design chosen )Tj
T*(single-handedly without prior popular consultation, and that represented more )Tj
T*(of a political regime than a whole nation. To encourage a greater acceptance of )Tj
T*(the new flag, the government issued all teaching establishments with one )Tj
T*(exemplar, whose symbols were to be explained to the students; textbooks were )Tj
T*(changed to intensively display these symbols. Also, December 1 \("Flag Day"\), )Tj
T*(January 31 and October 5 were declared national holidays.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Symbolism )Tj
T*( The Portuguese flag displays three important symbols: the field colours, and )Tj
T*(the armillary sphere and national shield, which make up the coat of arms. )Tj
T*( [edit] Colours )Tj
T*( The explanation for the green and red colours that make up the background )Tj
T*(field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime )Tj
T*(that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the )Tj
T*(hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who )Tj
T*(died serving the nation.[7] Sources believe these noble meanings are far from )Tj
T*(the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable )Tj
T*(justification to their choice.[8] )Tj
T*( Despite the fact that these colours never constituted a major part of the )Tj
T*(national flag until 1910, they were present in several historical banners )Tj
T*(during important periods. King John I included a green Aviz cross on the red )Tj
T*(bordure of his banner. The red cross of the Order of Christ was used over a )Tj
T*(white field as a naval pennon during the Discoveries and frequently on ship )Tj
T*(sails. A green background version was a popular standard of the rebellious )Tj
T*(during the 1640 revolution that restored Portugal's independence from Spain.[9] )Tj
T*(There are no registered sources to confirm that this was the origin of the )Tj
T*(republican colours. Another explanation gives full credit to the flag that was )Tj
T*(hoisted on the balcony of Porto's city hall during the 1891 insurrection. It )Tj
T*(consisted of a red field bearing a green disc and the inscription Centro )Tj
T*(DemocrÃ¡tico Federal Â«15 de NovembroÂ» \(English: Federal Democratic Centre Â«15 of )Tj
T*(NovemberÂ»\), representing one of many masonry-inspired republican clubs.[10] )Tj
T*(Over the following 20Â years, the red-and-green was present on every republican )Tj
T*(item in Portugal.[3] The 1891 flag-inherited red stands for the colour of the )Tj
T*(republican-inspired masonry-backed revolutionaries, whereas green was the )Tj
T*(colour Auguste Comte had destined to be present in the flags of positivist )Tj
T*(nations, an ideal incorporated into the republican political matrix.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Armillary sphere )Tj
T*( The armillary sphere was an important astronomical and navigational instrument )Tj
T*(for the Portuguese sailors who ventured into unknown seas, during the Age of )Tj
T*(Discoveries. It was introduced by the Knights Templar, whose knowledge was )Tj
T*(essential to the Portuguese Discoveries - Henry, the Navigator, the great )Tj
T*(responsible for the development of Age of Discovery was actually the Grand )Tj
T*(Master of the Order of Christ. It became, thus, the symbol of the most )Tj
T*(important period of the nationâ€”the Portuguese discoveries. In light of this, )Tj
T*(King Manuel I, who ruled during this period, incorporated the armillary sphere )Tj
T*(into his personal banner.[11] It was simultaneously used as the ensign of ships )Tj
T*(plying the route between the metropolis and Brazil,[12] thus becoming a )Tj
T*(colonial symbol and a fulcral element of the flags of the future Brazilian )Tj
T*(kingdom and empire. )Tj
T*( Adding to the sphere's significance was its common use on every )Tj
T*(Manueline-influenced architectural work, where it is one of the major stylistic )Tj
T*(elements, as seen on the JerÃ³nimos Monastery and BelÃ©m Tower.[13] )Tj

T*(another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with )Tj
T*(the first elements of today's shield appearing during the reign of Sancho )Tj
T*(I.[14] The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the )Tj
T*(evolution of the shield. )Tj
T*( Within the white inescutcheon, the five quinas \(small blue shields\) with their )Tj
T*(five white bezants representing the five wounds of Christ \(Portuguese: Cinco )Tj
T*(Chagas\) when crucified and are popularly associated with the "Miracle of )Tj
T*(Ourique".[15] The story associated with this miracle tells that before the )Tj
T*(Battle of Ourique \(July 25, 1139\), an old hermit appeared before Count Afonso )Tj
T*(Henriques \(future Afonso I\) as a divine messenger. He foretold Afonso's victory )Tj
T*(and assured him that God was watching over him and his peers. The messenger )Tj
T*(advised him to walk away from his camp, alone, if he heard a nearby chapel bell )Tj
T*(tolling, in the following night. In doing so, he witnessed an apparition of )Tj
T*(Jesus on the cross. Ecstatic, Afonso heard Jesus promising victories for the )Tj
T*(coming battles, as well as God's wish to act through Afonso, and his )Tj
T*(descendants, in order to create an empire which would carry His name to unknown )Tj
T*(lands, thus choosing the Portuguese to perform great tasks.[16] )Tj
T*( Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won the battle against an )Tj
T*(outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of )Tj
T*(the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Ã‰vora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy )Tj
T*(troops. Hence, in gratitude to Jesus, he incorporated five shields \(the quinas\) )Tj
T*(arranged in a crossâ€”representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy )Tj
T*(kingsâ€”with each one carrying Christ's five wounds in the form of silver )Tj
T*(bezants. The sum of all bezants \(doubling the ones in the central quina\) would )Tj
T*(give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.[16] )Tj
T*( However, evidence pointing out that the number of bezants on each quina was )Tj
T*(greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign,[15] as well )Tj
T*(as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a )Tj
T*(chronicle by FernÃ£o Lopes \(1419\),[17] support this explanation as one of pure )Tj
T*(myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was )Tj
T*(created by divine intervention and was destined for great things. )Tj
T*( The seven castles are traditionally considered a symbol of the Portuguese )Tj
T*(victories over their Moorish enemies, under Afonso III, who supposedly captured )Tj
T*(seven enemy fortresses in the course of his conquest of the Algarve, concluded )Tj
T*(in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not )Tj
T*(have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some )Tj
T*(reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve, )Tj
T*(in 1385, and was only fixed at seven in 1485. An hypothesis about the origin of )Tj
T*(the castles on a red bordure lies in the family ties of Afonso III with Castile )Tj
T*(\(both his mother and second wife were Castilian\), whose arms consisted of a )Tj
T*(golden castle on a red field.[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Evolution )Tj
T*( Since the foundation of Portugal, the national flag was always linked to the )Tj
T*(royal arms and, up until 1640, there was no official distinction between )Tj
T*(both.[19] It evolved in a way that gradually incorporated most of the symbols )Tj
T*(present on the current coat of arms. )Tj
T*( [edit] 1095â€“1248 )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The first heraldic symbol that can be associated with what would become the )Tj
T*(Portuguese nation was on the shield used by Henry of Burgundy, Count of )Tj
T*(Portugal since 1095, during his battles with the Moors. This shield consisted )Tj
T*(of a blue cross over a white field.[20] Nevertheless, this design has no )Tj
T*(reliable sources since it is a reconstruction that became popular and widely )Tj
T*(accepted thanks to the nationalistic purposes of the Estado Novo regime.[6] )Tj
T*( Henry's son Afonso Henriques succeeded him in the county and took on the same )Tj
T*(shield. In 1139, despite being outnumbered, he defeated an army of Almoravid )Tj
T*(Moors at the Battle of Ourique and proclaimed himself Afonso I, King of )Tj

T*(silver bezants \(most likely large-headed silver nails\), one set on the centre )Tj
T*(and one on each arm, symbolizing Afonso's newly-gained right to issue )Tj
T*(currency.[20][21] )Tj
T*( During the time of Afonso I, it was typical not to repair battle damage )Tj
T*(inflicted on the shield, so changes such as the breaking off0 of pieces, colour )Tj
T*(shifting or stains were very common. When Sancho I succeeded his father Afonso )Tj
T*(I, in 1185, he inherited a very worn off shield: the blue-stained leather that )Tj
T*(made the cross had been lost except where the bezants \(nails\) held it in place. )Tj
T*(This involuntary degradation was the basis for the next step on the evolution )Tj
T*(of the national coat of arms, where a plain blue cross transformed into a )Tj
T*(compound cross of five blue bezant-charged escutcheonsâ€”the quinas were thus )Tj
T*(born.[20][21] Sancho's personal shield \(called "Portugal ancien"[14]\) consisted )Tj
T*(of a white field with a compound cross of five quinas \(each one charged with )Tj
T*(eleven silver bezants\) with the bottom edges of the lateral ones facing towards )Tj
T*(the centre. Both Sancho's son Afonso II and grandson Sancho II used these )Tj
T*(arms,[20] as it was usual with direct succession lines \(cadency system\). A new )Tj
T*(modification of the royal arms was made when Sancho II's younger brother became )Tj
T*(king, in 1248. )Tj

T*(stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal )Tj

T*(but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, )Tj
T*(in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of )Tj
T*(Alfonso X of Castile. It is more likely that it was this family connection with )Tj
T*(Castile \(his mother was also Castilian\) that justified the new heraldic )Tj
T*(addition to the royal armsâ€”a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of )Tj
T*(yellow castlesâ€”rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its )Tj
T*(Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in )Tj
T*(the late 16th century. )Tj
T*( The inner portion contained the arms of Sancho I, although the number of )Tj
T*(bezants varied between seven, eleven and sixteen \(the latter number was used on )Tj
T*(Afonso's personal standard while he was still Count of Boulogne\).[20] This same )Tj
T*(design was used by the Portuguese kings until the end of the first dynasty, in )Tj
T*(1383; a succession crisis put the country at war with Castile and left it )Tj
T*(without a ruler for two years. )Tj
T*( In 1385, in the wake of the Battle of Aljubarrota, a second dynasty was )Tj
T*(founded when John, Master of the Order of Aviz and illegitimate son of King )Tj
T*(Peter I, acceded to the throne as John I. To his personal banner, John I added )Tj
T*(his Order's fleur-de-lys cross, displayed as green flowery points on the red )Tj
T*(bordure; this inclusion reduced the number of castles to twelve \(three around )Tj
T*(each corner\). The number of bezants in each escutcheon was reduced from eleven )Tj
T*(to seven.[20] This banner lasted a hundred years until John I's great-grandson )Tj
T*(John II restyled it, in 1485, introducing important changes: the removal of the )Tj
T*(Aviz cross, a downward arrangement and edge-smoothing of the quinas, and the )Tj
T*(definitive fixing of five saltire-arranged bezants in each quina and seven )Tj
T*(castles on the bordure \(as it is currently\).[22] John II's banner was the last )Tj

T*(first time.[11] )Tj
T*( In 1578, during the reign of Sebastian and on the eve of the fatal Battle of )Tj
T*(AlcÃ¡cer Quibir, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was )Tj
T*(permanently fixed at seven and the royal crown was converted into a closed )Tj

T*(SebastiÃ£o's death and the short-lived reign of his great-uncle Cardinal Henry, )Tj
T*(in 1580, a dynastic crisis was solved with the Spanish king Philip II acceding )Tj
T*(to the Portuguese throne as Philip I, installing a Spanish dynasty. The )Tj
T*(accession was made on the condition that Portugal was ruled as a separate, )Tj
T*(autonomous state, not as a province. This was fulfilled as Portugal and Spain )Tj
T*(formed a personal union under Philip I and his successors. A consequence of )Tj
T*(this administrative situation was the maintenance of the flag created under )Tj
T*(Sebastian's reign as the Portuguese national flag, while Spain had its own.[20] )Tj
T*(As the ruling house in Portugal, the Habsburg banner also included the )Tj
T*(Portuguese arms.[23] )Tj
T*( The country regained its independence from Spain, in 1640, in a coup d'Ã©tat )Tj
T*(that placed on the throne John, Duke of BraganÃ§a, as King John IV. Under his )Tj
T*(rule, the national flag was slightly changed as the ogival shield became )Tj

T*( When Afonso VI's younger brother Peter II replaced him on the throne, in 1667, )Tj

T*(long, as it was refurbished by Peter's son John V, after he took the throne, in )Tj
T*(1707. Heavily influenced by the luxurious and ostentatious court of the French )Tj

T*(wanted to transpose such style into the country's coat of arms. A red beret was )Tj
T*(added under the crown and the rounded shield was converted to a samnitic )Tj
T*(\("French type"\) shield. Instated by an absolute monarch like John V, this flag )Tj
T*(endured through almost the entire absolutist period in Portugalâ€”John V )Tj

T*( At the time of Queen Maria's death, the royal family was living in Brazil, )Tj

T*( [edit] Flag protocol )Tj
T*( [edit] Legislation )Tj
T*( The constitutional legislation concerning the use of the national flag is )Tj
T*(rather scarce and incomplete. In some cases, it still dates back to the )Tj
T*(beginning of the 20th century. The regulations for its military and naval use, )Tj
T*(however, are more recent and complete.[26] )Tj
T*( A revision of the decree no. 150, published on March 30, 1987, states that the )Tj
T*(flag is to be hoisted from 9:00Â a.m. to sunset \(during the night, it must be )Tj
T*(properly lit\), on Sundays and national holidays, throughout the entire national )Tj
T*(territory. It can also be displayed on days where official ceremonies or other )Tj
T*(solemn public sessions are held; in this case, the flag is hoisted on-site. The )Tj
T*(flag can be hoisted in other days if it is considered appropriate by the )Tj
T*(central government, or by other regional or local governing bodies, or by heads )Tj
T*(of private institutions. It must follow the official design standard and be )Tj
T*(preserved in good condition.[26] )Tj
T*( On the headquarter buildings of sovereign bodies, the flag can stay hoisted on )Tj
T*(a daily basis. It can also be hoisted on civilian and military national )Tj
T*(monuments; on public buildings associated with the central, regional or local )Tj
T*(administration; and on headquarters of public corporations and institutions. )Tj
T*(Citizens and private institutions can also display it, on the condition that )Tj
T*(they respect the relevant legal procedures. In the facilities of )Tj
T*(nationally-based international organizations or in the case of international )Tj
T*(meetings, the flag is hoisted according to the protocol used on those )Tj
T*(situations.[26] )Tj
T*( If national mourning is declared, the flag will be flown at half-staff during )Tj
T*(the fixed amount of days; any flag hoisted along with it will be flown in the )Tj
T*(same manner.[26] )Tj
T*( When unfurled in the presence of other flags, the national flag must not have )Tj
T*(smaller dimensions and must be situated in a prominent, honourable place, )Tj
T*(according to the relevant protocol:[26] )Tj
T*( Two flagpoles â€“ right pole viewed by a person facing the exterior;)Tj
T*(Three flagpoles â€“ central pole;)Tj
T*(More than three flagpoles:)Tj
T*(Within a building â€“ if odd number of poles, central pole; if even number, first )Tj
T*(pole on the right of the central point;)Tj
T*(Outside a building â€“ always the rightmost pole;)Tj
T*(  If flagpoles are not level, the flag must occupy the highest pole. The poles )Tj
T*(should be placed in honourable locations of the ground, building faÃ§ades and )Tj

T*(1.30Â metres \(4.26Â ft\) in length \(ratio 12:13\). Green and red are positioned at )Tj
T*(the hoist and fly, respectively, but occupy the field in an equal manner \(1â€“1\). )Tj
T*(Centred over the colour boundary lie the armillary sphere and Portuguese )Tj

T*(These are bound by a white stripe bearing the verse by LuÃ­s de CamÃµes "Esta Ã© a )Tj
T*(ditosa pÃ¡tria minha amada" \(English: "This is my beloved fortunate motherland"\) )Tj
T*(as the motto. This differs from the national coat of arms, where the laurel )Tj

T*( Louis Alexander Slotin \(1 December 1910Â â€“ 30 May 1946\) was a Canadian )Tj
T*(physicist and chemist who took part in the Manhattan Project, the secret U.S. )Tj
T*(program during World War II that developed the atomic bomb. As part of the )Tj
T*(project, Slotin performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to )Tj
T*(determine their critical mass values. During World War II, Slotin continued his )Tj
T*(research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. )Tj
T*( On 21 May 1946, Slotin accidentally began a fission reaction, which released a )Tj
T*(burst of hard radiation. He was rushed to a hospital, and died of radiation )Tj
T*(sickness nine days later on 30 May, the second victim of a criticality accident )Tj
T*(in history. Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for )Tj
T*(reacting quickly enough to prevent his accident from killing any colleagues. )Tj
T*(The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and )Tj
T*(non-fiction accounts. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, )Tj
T*(Yiddish-speaking refugees who had fled the pogroms of Russia to Winnipeg, )Tj
T*(Manitoba.[1] He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with )Tj
T*(a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants. From his early days at )Tj
T*(Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at St. John's High School, )Tj
T*(Slotin was academically exceptional.[1] His younger brother, Sam, later )Tj
T*(remarked that his brother "had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study )Tj
T*(long hours."[1] )Tj
T*( At the age of 16, Slotin entered the University of Manitoba to pursue a degree )Tj
T*(in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal )Tj
T*(in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a B.Sc. degree in geology from )Tj
T*(the university in 1932 and a M.Sc. degree in 1933. With the assistance of one )Tj
T*(of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at King's College London )Tj
T*(under the supervision of Arthur John Allmand,[1] the chair of the chemistry )Tj
T*(department, who specialized in the field of applied electrochemistry and )Tj
T*(photochemistry.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] King's College )Tj
T*( While at King's College, Slotin distinguished himself as an amateur boxer by )Tj
T*(winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave )Tj
T*(the impression that he had fought for the Spanish Republic and trained to fly a )Tj
T*(jet fighter with the Royal Air Force.[3] Author Robert Jungk recounted in his )Tj
T*(book Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic )Tj
T*(Scientists, the first published account of the Manhattan Project, that Slotin )Tj
T*("had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, more for the sake of the )Tj
T*(thrill of it than on political grounds. He had often been in extreme danger as )Tj
T*(an anti-aircraft gunner."[4] During an interview years later, Sam stated that )Tj
T*(his brother had gone "on a walking tour in Spain", and he "did not take part in )Tj
T*(the war" as previously thought.[1] Slotin earned a Ph.D. degree in physical )Tj
T*(chemistry from the university in 1936.[3] He won a prize for his thesis )Tj
T*(entitled "An Investigation into the Intermediate Formation of Unstable )Tj
T*(Molecules During some Chemical Reactions." Afterwards, he spent six months )Tj
T*(working as a special investigator for Dublin's Great Southern Railways, testing )Tj
T*(the Drumm nickel-zinc rechargeable batteries used on the Dublin-Bray line.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career )Tj
T*( [edit] University of Chicago )Tj
T*( In 1937, after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada's National )Tj
T*(Research Council,[5] the University of Chicago accepted him as a research )Tj
T*(associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, )Tj
T*(helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States.[6] The )Tj
T*(job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 )Tj
T*(to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, the head of the university's )Tj
T*(biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon \(carbon-14 and carbon-11\) from )Tj
T*(the cyclotron.[1] While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to )Tj
T*(demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for )Tj
T*(carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.[7] )Tj

T*(Pile-1", the first nuclear reactor, on 2 December 1942; the accounts of the )Tj
T*(event do not agree on this point.[8] During this time, Slotin also contributed )Tj
T*(to a number of papers in the field of radiobiology. His expertise on the )Tj
T*(subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result )Tj
T*(he was invited to join the Manhattan Project, the United States' effort to )Tj
T*(develop a nuclear bomb.[6] Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under )Tj
T*(future Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner at the university and later at the Oak )Tj
T*(Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He moved to the Los Alamos )Tj
T*(National Laboratory in New Mexico in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics )Tj
T*(group of Robert Bacher.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Los Alamos )Tj
T*( At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties consisted of dangerous criticality testing, )Tj
T*(first with uranium in Otto Robert Frisch's experiments, and later with )Tj
T*(plutonium cores. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of fissile )Tj
T*(materials to near-critical levels to establish their critical mass values.[9] )Tj
T*(Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain )Tj
T*(reaction as "tickling the dragon's tail," based on a remark by physicist )Tj
T*(Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to "tickling the tail of a )Tj
T*(sleeping dragon".[10][11] On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for )Tj
T*(Trinity, the first detonated atomic device, and became known as the "chief )Tj
T*(armorer of the United States" for his expertise in assembling nuclear )Tj
T*(weapons.[12] )Tj
T*( On 21 August 1945, Harry K. Daghlian, one of Slotin's close colleagues and a )Tj
T*(laboratory assistant, was performing a critical mass experiment when he )Tj
T*(accidentally dropped a heavy tungsten carbide brick onto a 6.2 kilograms \(14Â )Tj
T*(lb\) plutonium-gallium alloy bomb core.[13] The 24-year old Daghlian was )Tj
T*(irradiated with a large dose of neutron radiation. Later estimates would )Tj
T*(suggest that this dose might not have been fatal on its own, but he then )Tj
T*(received additional delayed gamma radiation and beta burns while disassembling )Tj
T*(his experiment.[14] He quickly collapsed with acute radiation poisoning and )Tj
T*(died one month later in the Los Alamos base hospital. Famed nuclear physicist )Tj
T*(Enrico Fermi reacted with a warning to Slotin: "Keep doing that experiment )Tj
T*([tickling the dragon's tail] that way and you'll be dead within a year".[15] )Tj
T*(Slotin was unmoved; he had done the test some forty times already by then.[15] )Tj
T*( After the war, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement )Tj
T*(in the project. He remarked, "I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to )Tj
T*(my disgust."[1] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was )Tj
T*(still required because, as he said, "I am one of the few people left here who )Tj
T*(are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." He looked forward to resuming his )Tj
T*(research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago and )Tj
T*(began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his work once he )Tj
T*(resumed his peacetime job.[1] )Tj
T*( In the 1945-46 winter, Slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold )Tj
T*(action. He repaired an instrument 6 feet under water inside the Clinton Pile )Tj
T*(while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be )Tj
T*(shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to )Tj
T*(be at least 100 roentgen.[16] A dose of 1 Gy \(~100 roentgen\) can cause nausea )Tj
T*(and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Criticality accident )Tj
T*( On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment )Tj
T*(that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by )Tj
T*(placing two half-spheres of beryllium \(a neutron reflector\) around a plutonium )Tj
T*(core. The experiment used the same 6.2-kilogram \(13.7Â lb\) plutonium core that )Tj
T*(had irradiated Harry K. Daghlian, Jr., later called the "Demon core" for its )Tj
T*(role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium )Tj
T*(hemisphere[18] with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he )Tj
T*(maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver )Tj
T*(with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a )Tj
T*(screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.[1] )Tj

T*(causing a "prompt critical" reaction and a burst of hard radiation.[9] At the )Tj
T*(time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and )Tj
T*(felt a heat wave. In addition, Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and )Tj
T*(an intense burning sensation in his left hand. Slotin jerked his left hand )Tj
T*(upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, )Tj
T*(ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of )Tj
T*(neutron radiation.[1] )Tj
T*( As soon as Slotin left the building, he vomited, a common reaction from )Tj
T*(exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation. Slotin's colleagues rushed )Tj
T*(him to the hospital, but massive and irreversible damage had already been done. )Tj
T*(Despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate )Tj
T*(blood for possible transfusions, Slotin's condition rapidly deteriorated,[1] )Tj
T*(and Major-General Leslie R. Groves informed Slotin's parents of their son's )Tj
T*(inevitable death. Over the next nine days Slotin suffered an "agonizing )Tj
T*(sequence of radiation-induced traumas" including severe diarrhea, reduced urine )Tj
T*(output, swollen hands, erythema, "massive blisters on his hands and forearms," )Tj
T*(intestinal paralysis, gangrene and ultimately "a total disintegration of bodily )Tj
T*(functions."[19] Slotin died on May 30 in the presence of his parents. He was )Tj
T*(buried in Winnipeg on 2 June 1946.[1] )Tj
T*( The core involved was used in the Able detonation, during the Crossroads )Tj
T*(series of nuclear weapon testing. Slotin's experiment was said to be the last )Tj
T*(conducted before the core's detonation and was intended to be the final )Tj
T*(demonstration of its ability to go critical.[20] )Tj
T*( Among the seven observers, two suffered from acute radiation syndrome but )Tj
T*(recovered. Years later, three of the observers eventually died of conditions )Tj
T*(that are known to be promoted by radiation, as did a security guard who was )Tj
T*(nearby during Daghlian's accident. Although some of those deaths were probably )Tj
T*(latent stochastic \(random\) effects of the accident, it is not possible to draw )Tj
T*(any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Radiation dosage )Tj
T*( The radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any )Tj
T*(semblance of accuracy. A large part of the dose was due to neutron radiation, )Tj
T*(which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available )Tj
T*(equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and )Tj
T*(badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like )Tj
T*(these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful )Tj
T*(data about gamma radiation.[14] )Tj
T*( A "tentative" estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens )Tj
T*(of assumptions, some of which are now known to be grossly incorrect. In the )Tj
T*(absence of personal dosimetry badges, the authors relied on measurements of )Tj
T*(sodium activation in the victim's blood and urine samples as their primary )Tj
T*(source of data. This activation would have been due to neutron radiation, but )Tj
T*(all doses were converted to equivalent doses of gamma or x-ray radiation. They )Tj
T*(concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to )Tj
T*(290 and 880 roentgen \(R\) [sic] \(respectively\) of gamma rays. Minimum and )Tj
T*(maximum estimates were about 50% and 200% of these values. The same document )Tj
T*(also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 keV X-rays and gamma rays, )Tj
T*(which the authors believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than )Tj
T*(the gamma equivalent. In this model, the equivalent x-ray doses were much )Tj
T*(higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, while the )Tj
T*(gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was )Tj
T*(estimated to be 1930 R of x-ray with 114 R of gamma, while Daghlian's )Tj
T*(equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 R of x-ray with 110 R of gamma.[14] )Tj
T*( In modern times, dosimetry is done very differently. Equivalent doses would )Tj
T*(not be reported in roentgen, they would be calculated with different weighting )Tj
T*(factors, and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as )Tj
T*(absorbed doses. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's )Tj

T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( The accident ended all hands-on critical assembly work at Los Alamos. Future )Tj
T*(criticality testing of fissile cores was done with special remotely controlled )Tj
T*(machines, such as the "Godiva" series, with the operator located a safe )Tj
T*(distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents.[24] )Tj
T*( On 14 June 1946, the associate editor of the Los Alamos Times, Thomas P. )Tj
T*(Ashlock, penned a poem entitled "Slotin â€“ A Tribute": )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(May God receive you, great-souled scientist!)Tj
T*(While you were with us, even strangers knew)Tj
T*(The breadth and lofty stature of your mind)Tj
T*(Twas only in the crucible of death)Tj
T*(We saw at last your noble heart revealed.[1])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing )Tj
T*(the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the critical reaction and )Tj
T*(protecting seven other observers in the room: "Dr. Slotin's quick reaction at )Tj
T*(the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the )Tj
T*(experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men )Tj
T*(working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general )Tj
T*(vicinity."[1] This interpretation of events was endorsed at the time by Alvin )Tj
T*(Graves, who stood closest to Slotin when the accident occurred.[15] Graves, )Tj
T*(like Slotin, had previously displayed a low concern for nuclear safety, and )Tj
T*(would later allege that fallout risks were "concocted in the minds of weak )Tj
T*(malingerers."[15] Another witness to the accident, Raemer E. Schreiber, spoke )Tj
T*(out publicly decades later, arguing that Slotin was using improper and unsafe )Tj
T*(procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself. Robert B. )Tj
T*(Brode had reported hearsay to that effect back in 1946.[1] )Tj
T*( In 1948, Slotin's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago )Tj
T*(initiated the Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund for lectures on physics given by )Tj
T*(distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates Luis )Tj
T*(Walter Alvarez and Hans Bethe. The memorial fund lasted until 1962.[1] )Tj
T*( In 2002, an asteroid discovered in 1995 was named 12423 Slotin in his )Tj
T*(honor.[25] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dollar unit of reactivity )Tj
T*( According to Weinberg and Wigner,[26] Slotin was the first to propose the name )Tj
T*("dollar" for the interval of reactivity between delayed and prompt criticality. )Tj
T*(The hundredth part of a dollar is called a "cent".[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Popular culture )Tj
T*( The accident has been detailed in at least three films, including the 1989 )Tj
T*(film Fat Man and Little Boy, a dramatization of the Manhattan Project starring )Tj
T*(Paul Newman. John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman who )Tj
T*(recreates Slotin's criticality accident at the same time the first atomic bomb )Tj
T*(is being tested. Scenes of Merriman dying of radiation sickness are intercut )Tj
T*(with scenes of the bomb test as a dramatic technique to show the horrible )Tj
T*(consequences associated with nuclear bombs.[28] Slotin's accidental death was )Tj
T*(also the subject of a 1999 documentary by Canwest Global and Great North )Tj
T*(Productions, Tickling the Dragon's Tail: The Mystery of Louis Slotin. The film )Tj

T*( Description )Tj
T*( The plumage of an adult Bald Eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and )Tj
T*(tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females )Tj
T*(are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the )Tj
T*(species in that females are 25 percent larger than males.[2] The beak, feet and )Tj
T*(irides are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and )Tj
T*(powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used )Tj
T*(to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front )Tj
T*(toes.[3] The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.[4] The adult Bald )Tj
T*(Eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African Fish )Tj
T*(Eagle \(H. vocifer\) \(from far outside of the Bald Eagle's range\) also has a )Tj
T*(brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the Bald in having a white )Tj
T*(chest and black tip to the bill.[5] )Tj
T*( The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white )Tj
T*(streaking until the fifth \(rarely fourth, very rarely third\) year, when it )Tj
T*(reaches sexual maturity.[2][3] Immature Bald Eagles are distinguishable from )Tj
T*(the Golden Eagle \(Aquila chrysaetos\), the only other very large, non-vulturine )Tj
T*(bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head )Tj
T*(with a larger beak, straighter edged wings which are held flat \(not slightly )Tj
T*(raised\) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover )Tj
T*(the legs. When seen well, the Golden Eagle is distinctive in plumage with a )Tj
T*(more solid warm brown color than an immature Bald Eagle, with a reddish-golden )Tj
T*(patch to its nape and \(in immature birds\) a highly contrasting set of white )Tj
T*(squares on the wing.[6] )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor )Tj
T*(\(accipitrid\) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is )Tj
T*(the California Condor \(Gymnogyps californianus\), a New World vulture which )Tj
T*(today are not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.[7] )Tj
T*(However, the Golden Eagle, averaging 4.18Â kg \(9.2Â lb\) and 63Â cm \(25Â in\) in wing )Tj
T*(chord length in its American race \(A. c. canadensis\), is merely 455Â g \(1.00Â lb\) )Tj
T*(lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the Bald Eagle in mean wing chord length )Tj
T*(by around 3Â cm \(1.2Â in\).[5][8] Additionally, the Bald Eagle's close cousins, )Tj
T*(the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed White-tailed Eagle and the )Tj
T*(overall larger Steller's Sea Eagle \(H. pelagicus\), may rarely vagrate to )Tj
T*(coastal Alaska from Asia.[5] )Tj

T*( Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle placed in the genus Haliaeetus \(sea eagles\) which gets both its )Tj
T*(common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the )Tj
T*(adult's head. Bald in the English name is derived from the word piebald, and )Tj
T*(refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker )Tj
T*(body.[16] The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus, New Latin for "sea )Tj
T*(eagle" \(from the Ancient Greek haliaetos\), and leucocephalus, Latinized Ancient )Tj
T*(Greek for "white head," from Î»ÎµÏ…ÎºÎ¿Ï‚ leukos \("white"\) and ÎºÎµÏ†Î±Î»Î· kephale )Tj
T*(\("head"\).[17][18] )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in )Tj
T*(his 18th century work Systema Naturae, under the name Falco leucocephalus.[19] )Tj
T*( There are two recognized subspecies of Bald Eagle:[2][20] )Tj
T*( H. l. leucocephalus \(Linnaeus, 1766\) is the nominate subspecies. It is )Tj
T*(separated from H. l. washingtoniensis at approximately latitude 38Â°Â N, or )Tj
T*(roughly the latitude of San Francisco.[21] It is found in the southern United )Tj
T*(States and Baja California.[22])Tj
T*(H. l. washingtoniensis \(Audubon, 1827\), synonym H. l. alascanus Townsend, 1897, )Tj
T*(the northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate leucocephalus. It is )Tj
T*(found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.[2][22] This subspecies )Tj
T*(reaches further south than latitude 38Â°Â N on the Atlantic Coast, where they )Tj
T*(occur in the Cape Hatteras area.[21])Tj
T*(  The Bald Eagle forms a species pair with the Eurasian White-tailed Eagle. )Tj
T*(This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of )Tj
T*(roughly equal size; the White-tailed Eagle also has overall somewhat paler )Tj
T*(brown body plumage. The two species fill the same Ecological niche in their )Tj
T*(respective ranges. The pair diverged from other Sea Eagles at the beginning of )Tj
T*(the Early Miocene \(c. 10Â Ma BP\) at the latest, but possibly as early as the )Tj
T*(Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is )Tj
T*(correctly assigned to this genus.[23] The two species probably diverged in the )Tj
T*(North Pacific, as the White-tailed Eagle spread westwards into Eurasia and the )Tj
T*(Bald Eagle spread eastwards into North America.[24] )Tj

T*( Habitat )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of )Tj
T*(American wetland habitat such as seacoasts, rivers, large lakes or marshes or )Tj
T*(other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown )Tj
T*(a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than 11Â km \(7Â )Tj

T*(optimal for breeding Bald Eagles.[28] )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of coniferous )Tj
T*(or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly )Tj
T*(is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and )Tj

T*( Behavior )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on thermal convection currents. )Tj
T*(It reaches speeds of 56â€“70 kilometers per hour \(35â€“43Â mph\) when gliding and )Tj
T*(flapping, and about 48 kilometers per hour \(30Â mph\) while carrying fish.[37] )Tj
T*(Its dive speed is between 120â€“160 kilometers per hour \(75â€“99Â mph\), though it )Tj
T*(seldom dives vertically.[38] It is partially migratory, depending on location. )Tj
T*(If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if )Tj
T*(the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain )Tj
T*(food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are )Tj
T*(subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for )Tj
T*(example, will disperse northwards in the summer.[39] The Bald Eagle selects )Tj
T*(migration routes which take advantage of thermals, updrafts, and food )Tj
T*(resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or )Tj
T*(may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. )Tj
T*(Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local )Tj
T*(hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.[3] )Tj
T*( Diet and feeding )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to predate a )Tj
T*(great variety of prey. Throughout their range, fish often compromise the lion's )Tj
T*(share of the eagle's diet.[40] In 20 food habit studies across the species' )Tj
T*(range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% )Tj
T*(and other prey 2%.[41] In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of )Tj
T*(the year-around diet of Bald Eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by )Tj

T*(found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake.[8] In the Pacific )Tj
T*(Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the Bald Eagles' diet from )Tj

T*(old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is )Tj
T*(thought that Bald Eagles mate for life. However, if one member of a pair dies )Tj
T*(or disappears, the other will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly )Tj
T*(failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.[87] Spectacular )Tj
T*(courtship rituals, involving vocalizations and acrobatic flight displays. Bald )Tj
T*(Eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The )Tj
T*(flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock )Tj
T*(talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground.[41][88] )Tj
T*(Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be 1 to 2 km \(0.62 to 1.2 )Tj
T*(mi\) of waterside habitat.[7] )Tj
T*( Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles )Tj
T*(are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg )Tj
T*(laying is often late February \(sometimes during deep snow in the North\), and )Tj
T*(incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to )Tj
T*(early May, and the young fledge late June to early July.[7] The nest is the )Tj
T*(largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and )Tj
T*(with new material added each year may eventually be as large as 4 meters \(13Â )Tj
T*(ft\) deep, 2.5 meters \(8.2Â ft\) across and weigh 1 metric ton \(1.1Â short )Tj
T*(tons\);[2] one nest in Florida was found to be 6.1 meters \(20Â ft\) deep, 2.9 )Tj
T*(meters \(9.5Â ft\) across, and to weigh 3 short tons \(2.7Â t\).[89] This nest is on )Tj
T*(record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal.[90] Usually nests )Tj
T*(are used for under five years or so, as they either collapse in storms or break )Tj
T*(the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the )Tj
T*(Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years without )Tj
T*(interruption.[30] The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees )Tj
T*(found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the Bald Eagle will )Tj
T*(nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from )Tj
T*(terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.[80] In Sonora, )Tj
T*(Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of Hecho catcuses \(Pachycereus )Tj
T*(pectinaboriginum\).[91] Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been )Tj
T*(reported historically in California, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, but )Tj
T*(currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona.[7] The eggs )Tj
T*(average about 73 millimeters \(2.9Â in\) long, ranging from 58 to 85 mm \(2.3 to )Tj
T*(3.3 in\), and have a breadth of 54 millimeters \(2.1Â in\), ranging from 47 to 63 )Tj
T*(cm \(19 to 25 in\).[37][41] Eggs in Alaska averaged 130Â g \(4.6Â oz\) in mass, while )Tj
T*(in Saskatchewan they averaged 114.4Â g \(4.04Â oz\).[92][93] As with their ultimate )Tj
T*(body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator.[41] Eagles )Tj
T*(produce between one and three eggs per year, rarely four eggs but this may be )Tj
T*(in exceptional cases of polygyny.[94] Eagles in captivity have been capable of )Tj
T*(producing up to seven eggs.[95] it is rare for all three chicks to successfully )Tj
T*(reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bear the advantage of larger )Tj
T*(size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards )Tj
T*(them.[7] Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest )Tj
T*(sibling sometimes attacks and kills their younger sibling\(s\), especially early )Tj
T*(in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.[7] Both the male and )Tj
T*(female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the )Tj
T*(incubation. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting )Tj
T*(material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling )Tj
T*(period at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to )Tj
T*(six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably \(with the )Tj
T*(parents often perching in trees nearby\).[7] A young eaglet can gain up to 170Â g )Tj
T*(\(6.0Â oz\) a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird.[30] The )Tj

T*(search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to )Tj
T*(reproduce.[96] )Tj
T*( Longevity and mortality )Tj
T*( The average lifespan of Bald Eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the )Tj
T*(oldest confirmed one having been 28 years of age.[4] In captivity, they often )Tj
T*(live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived )Tj
T*(for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population )Tj
T*(appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey.[97] As they are no )Tj
T*(longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of )Tj
T*(Florida eagles, adult Bald Eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate.[8] )Tj
T*(In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% )Tj
T*(even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely effected eagles in the )Tj
T*(area.[98] Of 1,428 individuals from across the wrong necropsied by National )Tj
T*(Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 \(23%\) eagles died from trauma, )Tj
T*(primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 \(22%\) died from gunshot; 158 )Tj
T*(\(11%\) died from poisoning; 130 \(9%\) died from electrocution; 68 \(5%\) died from )Tj
T*(trapping; 110 \(8%\) from emaciation; and 31 \(2%\) from disease; cause of death )Tj
T*(was undetermined in 293 \(20%\) of cases.[99] In this study, 68% of mortality was )Tj
T*(human-caused.[100] Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced )Tj
T*(to the species protected status.[101] In one case, an adult eagle investigating )Tj
T*(a Peregrine Falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping )Tj
T*(parent Peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it.[102] )Tj
T*( Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings. Around 50% of eagles )Tj
T*(survive their first year.[96] However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 )Tj
T*(radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year.[103] Occasionally, this is )Tj
T*(due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. )Tj
T*(Another significant cause of nestling mortality is predation. These have been )Tj
T*(verified to be predated by large gulls, corvids \(including ravens, crows and )Tj
T*(magpies\), Wolverines \(Gulo gulo\), hawks, owls, eagles, Bobcats \(Lynx rufus\), )Tj
T*(American black bears \(Ursus americanus\) and )Tj
T*(raccoons.[92][104][105][106][107][108][109][110] Nestlings are usually exempt )Tj
T*(from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but )Tj
T*(Arctic Foxes \(Vulpes lagopus\) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests )Tj
T*(on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island.[80] )Tj
T*(The Bald Eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even )Tj
T*(repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of )Tj
T*(a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.[111] )Tj
T*( Relationship with humans )Tj
T*( Population decline and recovery )Tj
T*( Once a common sight in much of the continent, the Bald Eagle was severely )Tj
T*(affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the )Tj
T*(thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT.[112] Bald )Tj
T*(Eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to )Tj
T*(biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it )Tj
T*(interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile )Tj
T*(or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to )Tj
T*(withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the )Tj
T*(eggs to hatch.[25] It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the Bald )Tj
T*(Eagle population was 300,000â€“500,000,[113] but by the 1950s there were only 412 )Tj
T*(nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US. Other factors in Bald )Tj
T*(Eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well )Tj
T*(as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote )Tj
T*(that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 Bald )Tj
T*(Eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the Bald Eagles under the )Tj
T*(long-held beliefs that Bald Eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with )Tj
T*(their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of )Tj
T*(predation \(lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be )Tj
T*(non-existent\).[114] Later illegal shooting was described as "the leading cause )Tj
T*(of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," according to a )Tj

T*(nests.[115] )Tj
T*( The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory )Tj
T*(Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The 1940 Bald Eagle )Tj
T*(Protection Act in the U.S., which protected the Bald Eagle and the Golden )Tj
T*(Eagle, prohibited commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The Bald Eagle )Tj
T*(was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the )Tj
T*(1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased )Tj
T*(penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in )Tj
T*(1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States.[116] DDT was completely )Tj
T*(banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the )Tj

T*( With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The )Tj
T*(Bald Eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States )Tj
T*(and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the )Tj
T*(estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000â€“115,000 by )Tj

T*(about 40,000â€“50,000, with the next highest population the Canadian province of )Tj
T*(British Columbia with 20,000â€“30,000 in 1992.[2] For some time, the stronghold )Tj
T*(breeding population of Bald Eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where )Tj

T*(significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the contiguous state with the largest )Tj
T*(number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, )Tj
T*(surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of )Tj
T*(the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of Bald )Tj
T*(Eagles.[26] )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list )Tj
T*(of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife )Tj
T*(Service, when it was reclassified from "Endangered" to "Threatened." On July 6, )Tj
T*(1999, a proposal was initiated "To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States )Tj
T*(From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife." It was de-listed on June )Tj
T*(28, 2007.[118] It has also been assigned a risk level of Least Concern category )Tj

T*(were killed in Prince William Sound, though the local population returned to )Tj
T*(its pre-spill level by 1995.[4] )Tj
T*( In captivity )Tj
T*( Permits are required to keep Bald Eagles in captivity in the United States. )Tj
T*(Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles )Tj
T*(which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to )Tj
T*(the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate )Tj
T*(caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care )Tj
T*(of eagles. Bald Eagles cannot legally be kept for falconry in the United )Tj
T*(States. As a rule, the Bald Eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being )Tj
T*(timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native )Tj
T*(American Tribes can obtain a "Native American Religious Use" permit to keep )Tj
T*(non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for )Tj

T*(messengers between gods and humans by some cultures.[121] Many pow wow dancers )Tj
T*(use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often )Tj
T*(used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia )Tj
T*(worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. The Lakota, for instance, )Tj
T*(give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In )Tj
T*(modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from )Tj
T*(college.[122] The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because )Tj
T*(their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect )Tj
T*(their young. The Kwakwaka'wakw scattered eagle down to welcome important )Tj
T*(guests.[123] The Choctaw explained that the Bald Eagle, who has direct contact )Tj
T*(with the upper world of the sun, is a symbol of peace.[124] )Tj
T*( During the Sun Dance, which is practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the )Tj
T*(eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork )Tj
T*(of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an )Tj
T*(eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine )Tj
T*(man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to )Tj

T*( Current eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable )Tj
T*(Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally )Tj
T*(authorized to obtain or possess Bald or Golden Eagle feathers for religious or )Tj

T*( National bird of the United States )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle is the national bird of the United States of America.[128] The )Tj
T*(founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with )Tj
T*(the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery \(usually involving the Golden Eagle\) )Tj
T*(was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the )Tj
T*(still-current design for the Great Seal of the United States including a Bald )Tj
T*(Eagle grasping 13 arrows and a 13-leaf olive branch with its )Tj
T*(talons.[129][130][131] )Tj
T*( The Bald Eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, )Tj
T*(including the Seal of the President of the United States and the Presidential )Tj
T*(Flag, and in many U.S. federal agency logos. Between 1916 and 1945, the )Tj
T*(Presidential Flag showed an eagle facing to its left \(the viewer's right\), )Tj
T*(which gave rise to the urban legend that the seal is changed to have the eagle )Tj
T*(face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.[132] )Tj
T*(Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that American )Tj
T*("founding-father" Benjamin Franklin ever publicly supported the Wild Turkey )Tj
T*(\(Meleagris gallopavo\), rather than the Bald Eagle, as a symbol of the United )Tj
T*(States. The origin of this claim is a letter Franklin wrote to his daughter in )Tj
T*(1784 from Paris. However, this letter was a criticism of the Society of the )Tj
T*(Cincinnati in which he stated his personal distaste for the Bald Eagleâ€™s )Tj
T*(behavior but he does not mention publicly disputing the choice of the Bald )Tj

T*( Once the track was supposedly done, Knowles had the idea that it would be )Tj
T*("perfect" if Jamaican reggae artist Sean Paul contributed a vocal track.[2] )Tj
T*(Knowles contacted Paul about a possible collaboration for "Baby Boy".[3][4] )Tj
T*(Sean Paul agreed, and flew in from Jamaica to join the recording sessions of )Tj
T*(the song.[2] He contributed a toast verse, and they finished recording "Baby )Tj
T*(Boy" in March 2003, during the later stages of the album's recording.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Music and theme )Tj
T*( "Baby Boy" is a midtempo contemporary R&amp;B and dancehall song[5][6] with )Tj
T*(reggae and Arabian music influences.[7][8][9] It was composed using common time )Tj
T*(in the key of C minor, and set in moderate groove of 92 beats per minute.[5] )Tj
T*(Storch's knowledge on Indian and Middle Eastern music contributes to its )Tj
T*(Eastern influences.[10] Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly noted that "'Baby )Tj
T*(Boy' goes full-tilt Bollywood 'n da hood, with Sean Paul ripping a pulsing )Tj
T*(tabla raga".[11] Knowles' vocals are accompanied by clicky and )Tj
T*(castanet-sounding beats,[12]synthesized handclaps and slaps.[13] According to )Tj
T*(Roger Friedman of Fox News Channel, "Baby Boy" is based on the 1995 reggae song )Tj
T*("Here Comes the Hotstepper", performed by Jamaican singer Ini Kamoze.[14] )Tj
T*( "Baby Boy" is considered to be a sequel in ways to "'03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde"; a )Tj
T*(2002 Jay-Z song featuring Knowles.[3] The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, )Tj
T*(and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Knowles' deemed them as personal )Tj
T*(to her.[4] Paul remarked, "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing )Tj
T*(me and her going here and there, all over the worldÂ ... I'm answering back, )Tj
T*(like, 'I'm wit it'."[3] The lyrics are constructed in the toastâ€“chorusâ€“verse )Tj
T*(form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Knowles sings all other verses and )Tj
T*(choruses. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, )Tj
T*(resolving at the toasting and final verse.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Release and reception )Tj

T*(singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with )Tj
T*(staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant )Tj
T*(motion, strutting in costumes".[54] She performed in a similar arrangement at )Tj
T*(the Los Angeles' Staples Center on September 2, 2007. She was dressed in a )Tj
T*(belly dancing outfit, and the performance was executed with several female and )Tj

T*(dance she executed in the song's music video.[52] )Tj
T*( When Knowles performed "Baby Boy" in Sunrise, Florida on June 29, 2009, she )Tj

T*( Waterfall Gully is an eastern suburb of the South Australian capital city of )Tj
T*(Adelaide. It is located in the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges around 5Â km )Tj
T*(\(3.1Â mi\) east-south-east of the Adelaide city centre. For the most part, the )Tj
T*(suburb encompasses one long gully with First Creek at its centre and Waterfall )Tj
T*(Gully Road running adjacent to the creek. At the southern end of the gully is )Tj
T*(First Falls, the waterfall for which the suburb was named. Part of the City of )Tj
T*(Burnside, Waterfall Gully is bounded to the north by the suburb of Burnside, )Tj
T*(from the north-east to south-east by Cleland Conservation Park \(part of the )Tj
T*(suburb of Greenhill\), to the south by Crafers West, and to the west by Leawood )Tj
T*(Gardens and Mount Osmond. )Tj
T*( Historically, Waterfall Gully was first explored by European settlers in the )Tj
T*(early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists )Tj
T*(and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land under the )Tj
T*(auspices of the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the )Tj
T*(management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South )Tj
T*(Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State )Tj
T*(Government control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, as it was then )Tj
T*(known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park. )Tj
T*( Over the years Waterfall Gully has been extensively logged, and early )Tj
T*(agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species )Tj
T*(as crops, along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries. )Tj
T*(Attempts to mine the area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one )Tj
T*(of the state's earliest water-powered mills, and a weir erected in the early )Tj
T*(1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside's water supply. Today the )Tj
T*(suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The Mount Lofty Ranges, which encompass Waterfall Gully, was first sighted by )Tj
T*(Captain Matthew Flinders in 1802.[1] The gully itself was discovered soon after )Tj
T*(the establishment of Adelaide, and Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor )Tj
T*(General of South Australia, was said to have "decided on the site for Adelaide )Tj
T*(when viewing the plains from the hills near Waterfall Gully".[1] Nevertheless, )Tj
T*(the gully had seen human visitors long before the arrival of the Europeans, as )Tj
T*(the native population had lived in the area for up to 40,000 years prior to )Tj
T*(Flinders' appearance off the South Australian coast.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ethnohistory )Tj
T*( In Australian Aboriginal mythology, Waterfall Gully and the surrounding Mount )Tj
T*(Lofty Ranges are part of the story of the ancestor-creator Nganno.[3] )Tj
T*(Travelling across the land of the native Kaurna people, Nganno was wounded in a )Tj
T*(battle and laid down to die, forming the Mount Lofty Ranges.[4] The ears of )Tj
T*(Nganno formed the peaks of Mount Lofty and Mount Bonython, and the region was )Tj
T*(referred to as Yur-e-billa, or "the place of the ears".[5] The name of the )Tj
T*(Greater Mount Lofty Parklands, Yurrebilla, was derived from this term,[4] while )Tj
T*(the nearby town of Uraidla employs a more corrupted form.[1] )Tj
T*( Although Hardy states that the Kaurna people did not live in the ranges )Tj
T*(themselves, they did live on the lower slopes.[6] An early settler of the )Tj
T*(neighbouring suburb of Beaumont, James Milne Young, described the local )Tj
T*(Kaurnas: "At every creek and gully you would see their wurlies [simple )Tj
T*(Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass] and their fires at night ... )Tj
T*(often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind )Tj
T*(the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river; some toward the Ranges; some on )Tj
T*(the Waterfall Gully."[7] Their main presence, demarcated by the use of fire )Tj
T*(against purchasers of land,[5] was on the River Torrens and the creeks that )Tj
T*(flowed into it, including Waterfall Gully's First Creek.[8] )Tj
T*( The land around Waterfall Gully provided the original inhabitants with a )Tj
T*(number of resources. The bark from the local stringybark trees \(Eucalyptus )Tj
T*(obliqua\)[5] was used in the construction of winter huts, and stones and native )Tj
T*(timbers were used to form tools.[2] Food was also present, and cossid moth )Tj

T*(larvae along with other species of plants and animals were collected.[5] )Tj
T*(Nevertheless, there were only a few resources that could only be found on the )Tj
T*(slopes, and "both hunting and food gathering would in general have been easier )Tj
T*(on the rich plains".[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early colonial exploration )Tj
T*( One of the earliest accounts of Waterfall Gully comes from a "Mr Kent" who, )Tj
T*(along with Captain Collet Barker and Barker's servant, Miles, climbed Mount )Tj
T*(Lofty in 1831. In making their ascent the party skirted a ravineâ€”described by )Tj
T*(Mr Kent as possessing "smooth and grassy sides"â€”which is believed by Anne Hardy )Tj
T*(to have been Waterfall Gully.[1] Subsequent to Barker's ascent, the first )Tj
T*(settlers who were recorded as having climbed Mount Lofty were Bingham )Tj
T*(Hutchinson and his servant, William Burt. The pair made three attempts to scale )Tj
T*(the mount before succeeding, and for their first attempt they attempted to )Tj
T*(traverse Waterfall Gully.[9] The attempt was unsuccessful, but in July 1837, )Tj
T*(Hutchinson wrote about the gully though which they had travelled. Waterfall )Tj
T*(Gully he wrote, had proven difficult, as the plants were so thickly grown as to )Tj
T*(provide a significant barrier to their progress. Near the point of surrender, )Tj
T*(Hutchinson described how they were "agreeably surprised by seeing a wall of )Tj
T*(rock about fifty or sixty feet [fifteen to eighteen meters] high, which )Tj
T*(stretched across the ravine, and from the top of it leapt the brook which had )Tj
T*(so long been [their] companion".[10] The brook was First Creek, and the )Tj
T*(waterfall they sighted is today known as First Falls.[11] )Tj
T*( Nevertheless, Hutchinson was not the first to see First Falls. The first known )Tj
T*(recorded sighting of the waterfall by a colonial was that of John William )Tj
T*(Adams, an emigrant of H.M.S. Buffalo in early January 1837, who named it )Tj
T*("Adams' Waterfall". He was traveling with his wife, Susanna and a party )Tj
T*(consisting of Nicholson's and Breaker's who had the use of a dray to go into )Tj
T*(the hills. Adams states "we were opposite the spot where the Eagle on the Hill )Tj
T*(now is, and the question was put, who would volunteer to go down the hillside )Tj
T*(to try for water".[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Development )Tj
T*( The area soon became a tourist attraction for the early South Australian )Tj
T*(colonists, and was a popular destination for picnickers. In 1851 Francis Clark )Tj
T*(wrote that "Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque place for a picnic that I )Tj
T*(have ever visited",[13] and by the 1860s the area had become known throughout )Tj
T*(Adelaide.[11] The use of Waterfall Gully as picnic spot was facilitated by the )Tj
T*(decision of the government of the day not to subdivide the area containing the )Tj
T*(waterfalls. Section 920, as it was designated, did not enter into private )Tj
T*(hands, and thus members of the public were able to access the area from the )Tj
T*(nearby suburb of Eagle on the Hill on Mount Barker road.[14] The position of )Tj
T*(the Eagle on the Hill hotel proved advantageous for this, as it permitted )Tj
T*(visitors to stop by for lunch before walking down the hill in the )Tj
T*(afternoon.[15] )Tj
T*( Other parts of the Waterfall Gully area were subdivided, though, and much of )Tj
T*(the area was owned by Samuel Davenport. Davenport used the land for timber, )Tj
T*(grazing, and the cultivation of various crops, including olives and grapes for )Tj
T*(wine production.[16] Other local residents ran market gardens and nurseries. )Tj
T*(For example, local residents Wilhelm MÃ¼gge and his wife Auguste Schmidt )Tj
T*(operated "one of the best nurseries and market gardens near Adelaide", and )Tj
T*(gained a reputation for the cheeses produced from their local dairy farm.[17] )Tj
T*(Along with farming, the hills and creek were prized areas for the sawyers and )Tj
T*(splitters,[8] and a number of mines were established in the region from the )Tj
T*(mid-to-late 19th century. In 1844 the first silver-lead, manganese and iron )Tj
T*(mines were established in the area, while the 1890s saw a minor gold )Tj
T*(rushâ€”although "only small quantities were extracted".[18] Of greater success )Tj
T*(was stone quarrying in Chambers' Gully, which began in 1863 and increased in )Tj
T*(scale in 1912.[18] )Tj
T*( Waterfall Gully was also the site of Burnside's "first secondary )Tj
T*(industry".[19] In the late 1830s, Thomas Cain built a watermill on First Creek )Tj
T*(for John Cannan, which was then employed to power a sawmill on Cannan's )Tj

T*(seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during )Tj
T*(1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres \(530,000Â USÂ )Tj
T*(gallons\) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside )Tj
T*(South,[21] and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding )Tj
T*(area.[22] As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available )Tj
T*(to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region )Tj
T*(disappeared.[23] )Tj
T*( While the route to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the )Tj
T*(alternative route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, )Tj
T*(many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire )Tj
T*(from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their )Tj
T*(propertiesâ€”especially from the MÃ¼gge familyâ€”led to pressure to build a road )Tj
T*(through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully road was built in the late 1880s.[24] )Tj
T*( The completion of the road led to an increase in visitor numbers.[23] Rather )Tj
T*(than a bumpy horse ride,[25] visitors could now catch the horse tram to the )Tj
T*(start of the gully, and walk, cycle or ride to the falls.[26] To provide for )Tj
T*(tourists, the area gained a number of road-side kiosks and produce stalls, and )Tj
T*(the MÃ¼gge family erected the two story Waterfall Hotel along the path. )Tj
T*(Furthermore, in 1912 the government opened a kiosk at the base of First )Tj
T*(Falls,[23] designed in the "style of a Swiss chalet".[27] The hotel is a )Tj
T*(private residence today, but the kiosk continues to operate.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Protection )Tj
T*( Although some parts of Waterfall Gully were transferred from the District )Tj
T*(Council of East Torrens \(now the Adelaide Hills Council\) to the City of )Tj
T*(Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established,[28] the )Tj
T*(government of the day chose to retain control of a significant portion of )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully.[29] Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was )Tj
T*(transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through )Tj
T*(the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F. Cleland.[29] )Tj
T*( The land remained under the Burnside Council's control until 1912, when the )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully Reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first National )Tj
T*(Pleasure Resort in the state. Initially the reserve was placed under the )Tj
T*(jurisdiction of the National Parks Advisory Board, but later it was moved to )Tj
T*(the Tourist Bureau, before finally becoming part of the National Park )Tj
T*(Commission's portfolio.[30] )Tj
T*( In 1945, much of the area that is today's Cleland Conservation Park was )Tj
T*(purchased by the State Government, largely thanks to the efforts of Professor )Tj
T*(Sir John Cleland. Most of this land was combined in 1963 to create the park )Tj
T*(that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards )Tj
T*(to Greenhill Road. Waterfall Gully Reserve was added to the park in 1972.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Natural disasters )Tj
T*( Over the years since European settlement Waterfall Gully has suffered from )Tj
T*(both bushfires and flooding. The gully was severely hit by a number of )Tj
T*(bushfires in 1939 that threatened the area, and further bushfires in the early )Tj
T*(1940s caused considerable damage because of the war effort diverting supplies )Tj
T*(and personnel from the Country Fire Service \(CFS\).[31] Significant floods )Tj
T*(occurred in 1889 and 1931,[32] and, on the night of 7 November 2005, Waterfall )Tj
T*(Gully was one of several areas in Adelaide to experience severe flooding. )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully was one of the hardest hit suburbs: Bob Stevenson, Duty Officer )Tj

T*(there's quite a few houses affected there ... there was 40 or so houses )Tj
T*(affected on that one road alone."[33] Properties were flooded, two bridges )Tj
T*(nearly collapsed, and 100Â m \(330Â ft\) of road was washed away. Burnside council )Tj
T*(workers, the CFS and the SES repaired the initial damage on the night while )Tj
T*(reconstruction of infrastructure commenced in late November. Much of the road )Tj
T*(had been inaccessible, and the suburb was closed except to residents and )Tj
T*(emergency workers for the remainder of the month.[34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Geography )Tj
T*( Waterfall Gully is situated at an average elevation of 234Â m \(768Â ft\) above )Tj
T*(sea level, in an area of 6.08Â km2 \(2.35Â sqÂ mi\). Its most notable geographical )Tj
T*(features are its gully and waterfall. Langman Reserve, a large local park, is )Tj
T*(300Â m \(980Â ft\) from the start of Waterfall Gully Road while much of the )Tj
T*(north-eastern side of the gully is part of Cleland Conservation Park. Adjoining )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully, 2Â km \(1.2Â mi\) away, is Chambers Gully, which used to function )Tj
T*(as a land-fill, but has in the past decade been reclaimed as a park through )Tj
T*(volunteer work.[35] It contains a number of old ruins, walking trails, and )Tj
T*(springs and is home to a significant number of native species. )Tj
T*( Since European Settlement the native plant life has been considerably )Tj
T*(affected, with the native Manna Gum and Blue Gum woodlands being largely )Tj
T*(cleared for agricultural uses.[36] The large amount of non-native vegetation in )Tj
T*(the gully is predominantly the result of the early agriculture, although some )Tj
T*(species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, )Tj
T*(hawthorn, fennel and blackberry.[37] With the reduction of native flora, exotic )Tj
T*(fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, )Tj
T*(blackbirds and starlings. However, not all of the native wildlife has been )Tj
T*(lostâ€”bats \(in particular, Gould's Wattled Bat\), can be found in the area, as )Tj
T*(can Superb Fairy-wrens and Adelaide Rosellas, and a large number of unique )Tj
T*(Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and possums can be spotted on some )Tj
T*(of the walking trails.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Transport )Tj
T*( Waterfall Gully is connected to the major Adelaide thoroughfare Greenhill Road )Tj
T*(by Waterfall Terrace and Glynburn Road, and cars are the preferred mode of )Tj
T*(transport in the suburb. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 71.9% )Tj
T*(of residents in the census area employed private vehicles for their commute to )Tj
T*(work. Only a small proportion \(1.3%\) walked to work and but 1.2% cycled, while )Tj
T*(only 3.6% of Waterfall Gully residents travel to work by bus.[39] The closest )Tj
T*(bus route for Waterfall Gully is the 142 bus, provided by the multi-service )Tj
T*(Adelaide Metro. )Tj
T*( Waterfall Gully Road is meandering and in some parts quite narrow. This has )Tj
T*(led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians )Tj
T*(and cyclists.[40] After the death of a cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair )Tj
T*(and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in )Tj
T*(parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by )Tj
T*(TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the )Tj
T*(time, it called for an investigation of the entire length of the road.[41] As )Tj
T*(of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of the road, )Tj
T*(with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Residents )Tj
T*( In the 2001 Census, the population of the Waterfall Gully census area \(which )Tj
T*(includes the suburbs of Glen Osmond, Leawood Gardens and Mount Osmond\) was )Tj
T*(2,497 people, in an area of 6.08 square kilometers. Females outnumbered males )Tj
T*(54.2% to 45.8%, and some 21.4% of the population was born overseas \(see chart )Tj
T*(for a breakdown\). There was only a slight change in the 2006 census, with the )Tj
T*(population increasing by 25 to 2,522.[39] )Tj
T*( The eight strongest religious affiliations in the area \(based on the 2006 )Tj
T*(census figures\) were \(in descending order\): Anglican, Catholic, Uniting, )Tj
T*(Lutheran, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Presbyterian, Church of Christ and )Tj

T*( Residents in these four suburbs are more affluent than the Adelaide average, )Tj
T*(with a high occurrence of incomes over A$1000 per week, which is also above the )Tj
T*(average for the City of Burnside. A majority of workers are employed in )Tj
T*(professional or white collar fields.[39] )Tj
T*( The census area that incorporates Waterfall Gully has a larger proportion of )Tj
T*(those in both the younger \(0â€“17\) and older \(60+\) age ranges than in the City of )Tj
T*(Burnside as a whole, and there have been no "numerically significant" changes )Tj
T*(in the age distribution between the 2001 and 2006 censuses. Similarly, family )Tj
T*(numbers are also stable, with almost no change between 2001 and 2006.[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Attractions )Tj
T*( The main attraction of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It is at )Tj
T*(the south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park. )Tj
T*(The weir at the bottom of the Waterfall was constructed in the late 19th )Tj
T*(century and was part of Adelaide's early water supply.[22] Development in the )Tj
T*(area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912.[43] )Tj
T*(Developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site, )Tj
T*(upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.[44] )Tj
T*( The Waterfall Gully Restaurant was constructed between 1911 and 1912 by South )Tj
T*(Australian architects Albert Selmar Conrad and his brother Frank,[45] and was )Tj
T*(formally opened by Sir Day Bosanquet on 9 November 1912.[43] Built in the style )Tj
T*(of a Swiss chalet, the building has been heritage listed since 1987,[45] and is )Tj
T*(reputedly haunted by the ghost of a firefighter who died from burns suffered in )Tj
T*(1926.[46] )Tj
T*( Other fire tracks and walking trails wind around the hills that surround )Tj
T*(Waterfall Gully, branching off from Chambers Gully, Woolshed Gully or the area )Tj
T*(around First Creek. Destinations include Crafers, Eagle On The Hill, Mount )Tj
T*(Lofty, Mount Osmond and the Cleland Wildlife Park, located in the Cleland )Tj
T*(Conservation Park. The tracks have been completely rebuilt and resurfaced in )Tj
T*(the past ten years, and a number of older and more perilous routes have been )Tj
T*(sealed because of the difficult terrain. Many offer views of the city of )Tj
T*(Adelaide as well as the Gully itself. One of these is notable for connecting to )Tj
T*(the 1,200Â km \(750Â mi\) Heysen Trail, and the trails are highly frequented. )Tj
T*( [edit] Politics )Tj
T*( Waterfall Gully is part of the state electoral district of Bragg, which has )Tj
T*(been held since 2002 by Liberal MP Vickie Chapman.[49] In federal politics, the )Tj
T*(suburb is part of the division of Sturt, and has been represented by )Tj
T*(Christopher Pyne since 1993.[50] The results shown are from the closest polling )Tj
T*(station to Waterfall Gullyâ€”which is located outside of the suburbâ€”at St David's )Tj
T*(Church Hall on nearby Glynburn Road \(Burnside\). Both electorates have )Tj
T*(traditionally gone to the Liberal Party,[49][50] and Bragg in particular is )Tj
T*(regarded as a very safe Liberal seat.[49] However, in the 2007 federal )Tj
T*(election, a strong swing towards the Labor Party and their candidate, Mia )Tj
T*(Handshin, resulted in the electorate transforming from a "safe [federal] )Tj
T*(Liberal seat into a marginal one".[51] )Tj
T*( In local government, Waterfall Gully is part of the ward of Beaumont within )Tj
T*(the City of Burnside, and the current Mayor for the district is David Parkin. )Tj
T*(Beaumont is currently represented by councilors Mark Osterstock and Anne )Tj

T*( Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar )Tj
T*(System.[13] It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is )Tj
T*(two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System )Tj
T*(combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and )Tj
T*(Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian )Tj
T*(or outer planets. The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times,[14] and )Tj
T*(was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The )Tj
T*(Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter.[15] When viewed from )Tj
T*(Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of âˆ’2.94, making it on average )Tj
T*(the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. \(Mars can )Tj
T*(briefly match Jupiter's brightness at certain points in its orbit.\) )Tj
T*( Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being )Tj
T*(helium, although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of )Tj
T*(molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,[16] but like the )Tj
T*(other gas giants, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its )Tj
T*(rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid \(it possesses )Tj
T*(a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator\). The outer atmosphere is )Tj
T*(visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in )Tj
T*(turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is )Tj
T*(the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least )Tj
T*(the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a )Tj
T*(faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. There are also at )Tj
T*(least 67 moons, including the four large moons called the Galilean moons that )Tj
T*(were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of )Tj
T*(these moons, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. )Tj
T*( Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most )Tj
T*(notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the )Tj
T*(Galileo orbiter. The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto-bound New )Tj
T*(Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe used the gravity from )Tj
T*(Jupiter to increase its speed. Future targets for exploration in the Jovian )Tj
T*(system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa. )Tj
T*( Structure )Tj
T*( Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. It is the largest )Tj
T*(of four gas giants as well as the largest planet in the Solar System with a )Tj
T*(diameter of 142,984Â km at its equator. The density of Jupiter, 1.326Â g/cm3, is )Tj
T*(the second highest of the gas giant planets. The density is lower than any of )Tj
T*(the four terrestrial planets. )Tj
T*( Composition )Tj
T*( Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of about 88â€“92% hydrogen and 8â€“12% )Tj
T*(helium by percent volume or fraction of gas molecules. Since a helium atom has )Tj
T*(about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom, the composition changes when )Tj
T*(described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, the )Tj
T*(atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the )Tj
T*(remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. The interior )Tj
T*(contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71% hydrogen, )Tj
T*(24% helium and 5% other elements by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts )Tj
T*(of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also )Tj

T*(318 times as massive.[3][23] Jupiter's radius is about 1/10 the radius of the )Tj
T*(Sun,[24] and its mass is 0.001 times the mass of the Sun, so the density of the )Tj
T*(two bodies is similar.[25] A "Jupiter mass" \(MJ or MJup\) is often used as a )Tj

T*(brown dwarfs. So, for example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of )Tj
T*(0.69 MJ, while Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of 12.8 MJ.[26] )Tj
T*( Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at )Tj
T*(present, the planet would shrink.[27] For small changes in mass, the radius )Tj
T*(would not change appreciably, and above about 500Â MâŠ• \(1.6 Jupiter masses\)[27] )Tj
T*(the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased )Tj

T*(until appreciable stellar ignition is achieved as in high-mass brown dwarfs )Tj
T*(around 50 Jupiter masses.[28] )Tj
T*( Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen )Tj
T*(and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in )Tj
T*(radius than Jupiter.[29][30] Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat )Tj

T*(similar to the total solar radiation it receives.[31] This additional heat )Tj
T*(radiation is generated by the Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz mechanism through adiabatic )Tj

T*( Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense core with a mixture of elements, a )Tj
T*(surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer )Tj

T*(is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but )Tj

T*( Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and )Tj
T*(possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and )Tj
T*(are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. )Tj

T*( Mythology )Tj
T*( The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the )Tj
T*(naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the )Tj
T*(sun is low.[131] To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. )Tj
T*(They used the roughly 12-year orbit of this planet along the ecliptic to define )Tj
T*(the constellations of their zodiac.[23][132] )Tj
T*( The Romans named it after Jupiter \(Latin: Iuppiter, IÅ«piter\) \(also called )Tj
T*(Jove\), the principal god of Roman mythology, whose name comes from the )Tj
T*(Proto-Indo-European vocative compound *DyÄ“u-pÉ™ter \(nominative: *DyÄ“us-pÉ™tÄ“r, )Tj
T*(meaning "O Father Sky-God", or "O Father Day-God"\).[133] In turn, Jupiter was )Tj
T*(the counterpart to the mythical Greek Zeus \(Î–ÎµÏÏ‚\), also referred to as Dias )Tj
T*(\(Î”Î¯Î±Ï‚\), the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.[134] )Tj
T*( The astronomical symbol for the planet, , is a stylized representation of the )Tj
T*(god's lightning bolt. The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, )Tj
T*(used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as zenographic.[135] )Tj
T*( Jovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, )Tj
T*(employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean "happy" or )Tj
T*("merry," moods ascribed to Jupiter's astrological influence.[136] )Tj
T*( The Chinese, Korean and Japanese referred to the planet as the wood star, )Tj
T*(Chinese: æœ¨æ˜Ÿ; pinyin: mÃ¹xÄ«ng, based on the Chinese Five Elements.[137] Chinese )Tj
T*(Taoism personified it as the Fu star. The Greeks called it Î¦Î±Î­Î¸Ï‰Î½, Phaethon, )Tj
T*("blazing." In Vedic Astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after )Tj
T*(Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods, and often called it "Guru", )Tj
T*(which literally means the "Heavy One."[138] In the English language, Thursday )Tj
T*(is derived from "Thor's day", with Thor associated with the planet Jupiter in )Tj
T*(Germanic mythology.[139] )Tj
T*( In the Central Asian-Turkic myths, Jupiter called as a "Erendiz/ErentÃ¼z", )Tj
T*(which means "eren\(?\)+yultuz\(star\)". There are many theories about meaning of )Tj
T*("eren". Also, these peoples calculated the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 )Tj

T*(one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide )Tj
T*(at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. )Tj
T*( Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, )Tj
T*(two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves )Tj
T*(differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with )Tj
T*(the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an )Tj
T*(inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by )Tj
T*(the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much )Tj
T*(material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable. A game may also result )Tj
T*(in a draw in several ways, where neither player wins. The course of the game is )Tj
T*(divided into three phases: opening, middlegame, and endgame. )Tj
T*( The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title )Tj

T*( Rules )Tj
T*( Main article: Rules of chess )Tj
T*( The official rules of chess are maintained by the World Chess Federation. )Tj
T*(Along with information on official chess tournaments, the rules are described )Tj
T*(in the FIDE Handbook, Laws of Chess section.[1] )Tj
T*( Setup )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Initial position: first row: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, )Tj
T*(knight, and rook; second row: pawns )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Chess is played on a square board of eight rows \(called ranks and denoted with )Tj
T*(numbers 1 to 8\) and eight columns \(called files and denoted with letters a to )Tj
T*(h\) of squares. The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as )Tj
T*("light squares" and "dark squares". The chessboard is placed with a light )Tj
T*(square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player, and the pieces )Tj
T*(are set out as shown in the diagram, with each queen on its own color. )Tj
T*( The pieces are divided, by convention, into white and black sets. The players )Tj
T*(are referred to as "White" and "Black", and each begins the game with 16 pieces )Tj
T*(of the specified color. These consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two )Tj
T*(bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. )Tj
T*( Movement )Tj
T*( White always moves first. After the initial move, the players alternately move )Tj
T*(one piece at a time \(with the exception of castling, when two pieces are )Tj
T*(moved\). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an )Tj
T*(opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole )Tj
T*(exception of en passant, all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the )Tj
T*(square that the opponent's piece occupies. A player may not make any move that )Tj
T*(would put or leave his king under attack. If the player to move has no legal )Tj
T*(moves, the game is over; it is either a checkmate \(a loss for the player with )Tj
T*(no legal moves\)â€”if the king is under attackâ€”or a stalemate \(a draw\)â€”if the king )Tj
T*(is not. )Tj
T*( Each chess piece has its own style of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark )Tj
T*(the squares where the piece can move if no other pieces \(including one's own )Tj
T*(piece\) are on the squares between the piece's initial position and its )Tj
T*(destination. )Tj
T*( The king moves one square in any direction. The king has also a special move )Tj
T*(which is called castling and involves also moving a rook.)Tj
T*(The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not )Tj
T*(leap over other pieces. Along with the king, the rook is involved during the )Tj
T*(king's castling move.)Tj
T*(The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over )Tj
T*(other pieces.)Tj
T*(The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of )Tj
T*(squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces.)Tj
T*(The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, )Tj
T*(file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and )Tj
T*(one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. )Tj
T*(The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.)Tj
T*(The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it )Tj
T*(on the same file; or on its first move it may advance two squares along the )Tj
T*(same file provided both squares are unoccupied; or it may move to a square )Tj

T*(move only. They capture diagonally \(black "x"s\); they cannot capture with their )Tj
T*(normal move \(black "â—"s\). Pawns also are involved in the special capture called )Tj
T*(en passant. )Tj
T*( Castling )Tj
T*( Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as )Tj
T*(castling. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank )Tj
T*(toward a rook \(which is on the player's first rank[note 1]\) and then placing )Tj
T*(the rook on the last square the king has just crossed. Castling is permissible )Tj
T*(only if all of the following conditions hold:[2] )Tj
T*( Neither of the pieces involved in castling may have been previously moved )Tj
T*(during the game.)Tj
T*(There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.)Tj
T*(The king may not be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are )Tj
T*(under attack by enemy pieces, nor move to a square where it is in check.)Tj
T*( En passant )Tj
T*( When a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an )Tj
T*(opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the )Tj
T*(opponent's pawn can capture it en passant \(in passing\), and move to the square )Tj
T*(the pawn passed over. However, this can only be done on the very next move, )Tj
T*(otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. For example, if the black pawn has )Tj
T*(just advanced two squares from g7 \(initial starting position\) to g5, then the )Tj
T*(white pawn on f5 may take it via en passant on g6 \(but only on white's next )Tj
T*(move\). )Tj
T*( Promotion )Tj
T*( When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted )Tj
T*(and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight )Tj
T*(of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but )Tj
T*(in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the )Tj
T*(diagram on the right, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be )Tj
T*(promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that )Tj
T*(is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type )Tj
T*(than at the start of the game \(for example, two queens\). )Tj
T*( Check )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Black's king is in check from the rook. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Main article: Check \(chess\) )Tj
T*( When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, )Tj
T*(it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results )Tj
T*(in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack \(that is, not in )Tj
T*(check\). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece )Tj
T*(between the checking piece and the king \(which is possible only if the )Tj
T*(attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it )Tj
T*(and the king\); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. )Tj
T*(Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to )Tj
T*(checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and )Tj
T*(there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to )Tj
T*(make a move that would put or leave his own king in check. )Tj
T*( End of the game )Tj
T*( Although the objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent, chess games )Tj
T*(do not have to end in checkmateâ€”either player may resign which is a win for the )Tj
T*(other player. It is considered bad etiquette to continue playing when in a )Tj

T*( Chess games and positions are recorded using a special notation, most often )Tj
T*(algebraic chess notation.[5] Abbreviated \(or short\) algebraic notation )Tj
T*(generally records moves in the format "abbreviation of the piece moved â€“ file )Tj
T*(where it moved â€“ rank where it moved". For example, Qg5 means "queen moves to )Tj
T*(the g-file and 5th rank" \(that is, to the square g5\). If there are two pieces )Tj
T*(of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is )Tj
T*(added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means )Tj
T*("knight from the g-file moves to the square f3". The letter P indicating a pawn )Tj
T*(is not used, so that e4 means "pawn moves to the square e4". )Tj
T*( If the piece makes a capture, "x" is inserted before the destination square. )Tj
T*(Thus Bxf3 means "bishop captures on f3". When a pawn makes a capture, the file )Tj
T*(from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial, and ranks may )Tj
T*(be omitted if unambiguous. For example, exd5 \(pawn on the e-file captures the )Tj
T*(piece on d5\) or exd \(pawn on the e-file captures a piece somewhere on the )Tj
T*(d-file\). )Tj
T*( If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is )Tj
T*(indicated after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is indicated by the )Tj
T*(special notations 0-0 for kingside castling and 0-0-0 for queenside castling. )Tj
T*(An en passant capture is sometimes marked with the notation "e.p." A move that )Tj
T*(places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation "+" added. )Tj
T*(Checkmate can be indicated by "#" \(occasionally "++", although this is )Tj
T*(sometimes used for a double check instead\). At the end of the game, "1â€“0" means )Tj
T*("White won", "0â€“1" means "Black won", and "Â½â€“Â½" indicates a draw.[6] )Tj
T*( Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols. For )Tj

T*(players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging )Tj

T*( Fundamentals of strategy )Tj
T*( Main article: Chess strategy )Tj
T*( Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with )Tj
T*(setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the )Tj
T*(evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value )Tj
T*(of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn )Tj
T*(structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares )Tj
T*(\(for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares\). )Tj
T*( The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of )Tj
T*(pieces of both sides.[13] The point values used for this purpose are based on )Tj
T*(experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops )Tj
T*(about three points each, rooks about five points \(the value difference between )Tj
T*(a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange\), and queens about )Tj
T*(nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, )Tj
T*(since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms, in the endgame the )Tj
T*(king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but )Tj
T*(less powerful than a rook.[14] These basic values are then modified by other )Tj
T*(factors like position of the piece \(for example, advanced pawns are usually )Tj

T*(positions\).[15] )Tj
T*( Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn )Tj
T*(structure \(sometimes known as the pawn skeleton\), or the configuration of pawns )Tj
T*(on the chessboard.[16] Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, )Tj
T*(the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic )Tj
T*(nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, )Tj
T*(doubled, or backward pawns and holes, once created, are often permanent. Care )Tj
T*(must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated )Tj
T*(by another valuable asset \(for example, by the possibility of developing an )Tj
T*(attack\).[17] )Tj
T*( Phases )Tj
T*( Opening )Tj
T*( Main article: Chess opening )Tj
T*( A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game \(the "opening moves"\). )Tj
T*(Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been )Tj
T*(given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defence. They are catalogued in )Tj
T*(reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens )Tj
T*(of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play )Tj
T*(\(for example, the RÃ©ti Opening\) to very aggressive \(the Latvian Gambit\). In )Tj
T*(some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been )Tj
T*(worked out to more than 30 moves.[18] Professional players spend years studying )Tj
T*(openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory )Tj
T*(continues to evolve. )Tj
T*( The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:[19] )Tj
T*( Development: This is the technique of placing the pieces \(particularly bishops )Tj
T*(and knights\) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the )Tj
T*(game.)Tj
T*(Control of the center: Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved )Tj
T*(to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect )Tj
T*(on the opponent.)Tj
T*(King safety: It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. )Tj
T*(A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.)Tj
T*(Pawn structure: Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as )Tj
T*(isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands â€“ and to force such )Tj
T*(weaknesses in the opponent's position.)Tj
T*(  Most players and theoreticians consider that White, by virtue of the first )Tj
T*(move, begins the game with a small advantage. This initially gives White the )Tj
T*(initiative.[20] Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and )Tj
T*(achieve equality, or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position. )Tj
T*( Middlegame )Tj
T*( The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There )Tj
T*(is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the )Tj
T*(middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. \(Similarly, there )Tj
T*(is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the )Tj
T*(endgame.\) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans )Tj
T*(based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account )Tj
T*(the tactical possibilities of the position.[21] The middlegame is the phase in )Tj
T*(which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves )Tj
T*(executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with )Tj
T*(an attack against the opponent's king; some typical patterns have their own )Tj
T*(names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Laskerâ€“Bauer combination.[22] )Tj
T*( Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of )Tj
T*(openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure. An example is the )Tj
T*(minority attack, which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who )Tj
T*(has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected )Tj
T*(to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.[23] )Tj
T*( Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to )Tj
T*(reduce material and transition into an endgame \(i.e. simplify\). Minor material )Tj
T*(advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and )Tj
T*(therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an )Tj

T*( An example of zugzwang: the side having to move is at a disadvantage. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The endgame \(or end game or ending\) is the stage of the game when there are )Tj
T*(few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences )Tj
T*(between earlier stages of the game and endgame:[25] )Tj
T*( During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around )Tj
T*(attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.)Tj
T*(The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of )Tj
T*(checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the )Tj
T*(center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of )Tj
T*(opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.)Tj
T*(Zugzwang, a disadvantage because the player has to make a move, is often a )Tj
T*(factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. For example, the )Tj
T*(diagram on the right is zugzwang for both sides, as with Black to move he must )Tj
T*(play 1...Kb7 and let White promote a pawn after 2.Kd7; and with White to move )Tj
T*(he must allow a draw by 1.Kc6 stalemate or lose his last pawn by any other )Tj
T*(legal move.)Tj
T*(  Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on )Tj

T*(chess.[28] )Tj
T*( The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the )Tj
T*(earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout )Tj
T*(Europe.[33] Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th )Tj
T*(century, it was described in a famous 13th-century manuscript covering )Tj
T*(shatranj, backgammon, and dice named the Libro de los juegos. Another theory )Tj
T*(contends that chess arose from the game xiangqi \(Chinese Chess\) or one of its )Tj
T*(predecessors,[34] although this has been contested.[35] )Tj
T*( Origins of the modern game \(1000â€“1850\) )Tj
T*( Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, )Tj
T*(and around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known )Tj
T*(today.[33] These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and )Tj
T*(Spain.[36][37] Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first )Tj
T*(move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The queen )Tj
T*(replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and )Tj
T*(by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece;[38] consequently modern )Tj
T*(chess was referred to as "Queen's Chess" or "Mad Queen Chess".[39] These new )Tj
T*(rules quickly spread throughout western Europe. The rules about stalemate were )Tj
T*(finalized in the early 19th century. To distinguish it from its predecessors, )Tj
T*(this version of the rules is sometimes referred to as western chess[40] or )Tj
T*(international chess.[41] )Tj
T*( Writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th )Tj
T*(century. The RepeticiÃ³n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez \(Repetition of Love and the )Tj
T*(Art of Playing Chess\) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was published )Tj
T*(in Salamanca in 1497.[37] Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro )Tj
T*(Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and )Tj
T*(Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy LÃ³pez de Segura developed elements of )Tj
T*(openings and started to analyze simple endgames. )Tj
T*( In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from the Southern )Tj
T*(European countries to France. The two most important French masters were )Tj
T*(FranÃ§ois-AndrÃ© Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, who discovered the )Tj
T*(importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles MahÃ© de La )Tj
T*(Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander )Tj
T*(McDonnell in 1834.[42] Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee )Tj
T*(houses in big European cities like CafÃ© de la RÃ©gence in Paris and Simpson's )Tj
T*(Divan in London.[43][44] )Tj
T*( As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many )Tj
T*(chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were )Tj
T*(correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club )Tj
T*(played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824.[45]Chess problems became a )Tj
T*(regular part of 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and )Tj

T*(how to prepare attacks.[49]Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz later described how to )Tj
T*(avoid weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such )Tj
T*(weaknesses in the opponent's position.[50] The scientific approach and )Tj
T*(positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz was the )Tj
T*(first to break a position down into its components.[51] Before Steinitz, )Tj
T*(players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other )Tj
T*(pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded )Tj
T*(or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep )Tj
T*(plan.[52] In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an )Tj
T*(important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes )Tj
T*(Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. )Tj
T*(Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German )Tj
T*(mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27 years, the )Tj
T*(longest tenure of all World Champions.[53] )Tj
T*( After the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and )Tj
T*(matches held annually quickly grew. Some sources state that in 1914 the title )Tj
T*(of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia )Tj
T*(to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch, and Marshall, but this is a disputed )Tj
T*(claim.[note 4] The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World )Tj
T*(Chess Federation \(FIDE\), founded in 1924 in Paris. In 1927, the Women's World )Tj
T*(Chess Championship was established; the first to hold the title was )Tj
T*(Czech-English master Vera Menchik.[54] It took a prodigy from Cuba, JosÃ© RaÃºl )Tj
T*(Capablanca \(World Champion 1921â€“27\), who loved simple positions and endgames, )Tj
T*(to end the German-speaking dominance in chess; he was undefeated in tournament )Tj
T*(play for eight years, until 1924. His successor was Russian-French Alexander )Tj
T*(Alekhine, a strong attacking player who died as the World champion in 1946. He )Tj
T*(briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two )Tj
T*(years later.[55] )Tj
T*( Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school )Tj
T*(of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard RÃ©ti. They )Tj
T*(advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than )Tj
T*(with pawns, which invited opponents to occupy the center with pawns, which )Tj
T*(become objects of attack.[56] )Tj
T*( Post-war era \(1945 and later\) )Tj
T*( After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought. FIDE, who have )Tj
T*(controlled the title since then \(except for one interruption\), ran a tournament )Tj
T*(of elite players. The winner of the 1948 tournament, Russian Mikhail Botvinnik, )Tj
T*(started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world. Until the end of the )Tj
T*(Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American Bobby Fischer )Tj
T*(\(champion 1972â€“75\).[57] Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously )Tj
T*(Black strove for equality, to neutralize White's first-move advantage. As )Tj
T*(Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning.[58] In the )Tj
T*(previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided )Tj
T*(which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to )Tj
T*(seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments )Tj
T*(and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal )Tj
T*(tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal )Tj
T*(tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the )Tj
T*("Candidates" stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of )Tj
T*(knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning )Tj
T*(champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a )Tj
T*(rematch a year later. This system operated on a three-year cycle. Botvinnik )Tj
T*(participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the )Tj
T*(world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in )Tj
T*(1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to Vasily Smyslov, but regained the title in a )Tj

T*(in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title.[note 5] )Tj
T*( As of August 2011, there are 1363 active grandmasters and 3153 international )Tj
T*(masters in the world. Top three countries with the largest numbers of )Tj
T*(grandmasters are Russia, Ukraine, and Germany, with 208, 78, and 76. The )Tj
T*(country with most grandmasters per capita is Iceland, with 11 GMs and 13 IMs )Tj
T*(among the population of 310,000.[87] )Tj
T*( International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems )Tj
T*(and to correspondence chess players \(by the International Correspondence Chess )Tj
T*(Federation\). National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the )Tj
T*(advanced players still under the level needed for international titles; an )Tj
T*(example is the Chess expert title used in the United States. )Tj
T*( In order to rank players, FIDE, ICCF, and national chess organizations use the )Tj
T*(Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. Elo is a statistical system based on )Tj
T*(the assumption that the chess performance of each player in their games is a )Tj
T*(random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of )Tj
T*(that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the )Tj
T*(average from results of player's games. The US Chess Federation implemented )Tj
T*(Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being )Tj
T*(both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in )Tj
T*(1970.[note 6] The highest FIDE rating of all time, 2861, was achieved by Magnus )Tj
T*(Carlsen on the January 2013 FIDE rating list.[88] )Tj
T*( Publications )Tj
T*( Chess has a very extensive literature. In 1913, the chess historian H.J.R. )Tj
T*(Murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and chess columns in )Tj
T*(newspapers to be about 5,000.[89][90]B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of )Tj
T*(1949, to be about 20,000.[90]David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, "Since )Tj
T*(then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess )Tj
T*(publications. No one knows how many have been printed."[90] There are two )Tj
T*(significant public chess libraries: the John G. White Chess and Checkers )Tj
T*(Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over )Tj
T*(6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals;[91] and the Chess &amp; Draughts )Tj
T*(collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 )Tj
T*(books.[92]Grandmaster Lothar Schmid owns the world's largest private collection )Tj
T*(of chess books and memorabilia.[93] David DeLucia's chess library contains )Tj
T*(7,000 to 8,000 chess books, a similar number of autographs \(letters, score )Tj

T*(opines that DeLucia's collection "is arguably the finest chess collection in )Tj
T*(the world".[95] )Tj
T*( Mathematics and computers )Tj
T*( The game structure and nature of chess is related to several branches of )Tj
T*(mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess )Tj
T*(were known of for hundreds of years. In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a )Tj
T*(basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered as one of the )Tj
T*(predecessors of game theory.[96] )Tj
T*( The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be between 1043 and )Tj
T*(1047 \(a provable upper bound[97][98]\), with a game-tree complexity of )Tj
T*(approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by )Tj
T*(Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number.[99] Typically an )Tj
T*(average position has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as )Tj
T*(zero \(in the case of checkmate or stalemate\) or as many as 218.[100] )Tj
T*( One of the most important mathematical challenges of chess is the development )Tj
T*(of algorithms that can play chess. The idea of creating a chess-playing machine )Tj
T*(dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The )Tj
T*(Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax.[101] Serious trials based on )Tj

T*( Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts, )Tj
T*(computer engineers and computer scientists have built, with increasing degrees )Tj
T*(of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs.[102] )Tj
T*(The groundbreaking paper on computer chess, "Programming a Computer for Playing )Tj
T*(Chess", was published in 1950 by Shannon.[note 7] He wrote: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: \(1\) the problem is )Tj
T*(sharply defined both in allowed operations \(the moves\) and in the ultimate goal )Tj
T*(\(checkmate\); \(2\) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for )Tj

T*(possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of )Tj
T*("thinking"; \(4\) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital )Tj
T*(nature of modern computers.[104])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The Association for Computing Machinery \(ACM\) held the first major chess )Tj
T*(tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in )Tj
T*(September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won )Tj
T*(the championship. Nowadays, chess programs compete in the World Computer Chess )Tj
T*(Championship, held annually since 1974. At first considered only a curiosity, )Tj
T*(the best chess playing programs, for example Rybka, have become extremely )Tj
T*(strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match against a reigning World Champion )Tj
T*(for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3Â½â€“2Â½ \(it scored two )Tj
T*(wins, one loss, and three draws\).[105][106] In 2009, a mobile phone won a )Tj
T*(category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 )Tj
T*(running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with )Tj
T*(nine wins and one draw.[107] The best chess programs are now able to beat the )Tj
T*(strongest human players. )Tj
T*( With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability, computers can )Tj
T*(help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. Internet Chess Servers )Tj
T*(allow people to find and play opponents all over the world. The presence of )Tj
T*(computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding )Tj
T*(cheating during games, most notably the "bathroom controversy" during the 2006 )Tj
T*(World Championship.[108] )Tj
T*( Zermelo's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess, i. e. to )Tj
T*(determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game \(namely that if )Tj
T*(the game cannot end in a draw, then one of the two players must have a winning )Tj
T*(strategy\). However, according to Claude Shannon, the timeframe required puts )Tj
T*(this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology. It is unknown )Tj
T*(whether an indirect proof of the outcome of a perfectly played game exists. In )Tj
T*(other words, it is not known whether or not it is possible to determine the )Tj
T*(outcome without determining the optimal strategy itself. )Tj
T*( Psychology )Tj
T*( There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology.[note 8][note )Tj
T*(9][110][111][112][113]Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, )Tj
T*(rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise.[114][115] In )Tj
T*(his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly )Tj
T*(perceive the key features of a position.[116] According to de Groot, this )Tj
T*(perception, made possible by years of practice and study, is more important )Tj
T*(than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters )Tj
T*(can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to )Tj
T*(memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and )Tj
T*(novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent )Tj
T*(recall \(about half a dozen positions in each case\). Rather, it is the ability )Tj
T*(to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the )Tj
T*(skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken )Tj
T*(from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.[117] )Tj
T*( More recent research has focused on chess as mental training; the respective )Tj
T*(roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess )Tj

T*(in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess )Tj
T*(expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and )Tj
T*(other domains of expertise has led to a lot of research recently. Ericsson and )Tj
T*(colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high )Tj
T*(levels of expertise in chess.[118] Recent research indicates that factors other )Tj
T*(than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues )Tj
T*(have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that )Tj
T*(experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in )Tj
T*(late winter and early spring. Chess players are more likely to be )Tj
T*(non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and )Tj
T*(skill.[119] )Tj
T*( Chess and intelligence )Tj
T*( Although the link between performance in chess and general intelligence is )Tj
T*(often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence.[120] )Tj
T*(For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as )Tj
T*(measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players )Tj
T*(and regular people.[121] There is some evidence towards a correlation between )Tj
T*(performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, )Tj
T*(performance in chess also relies substantially on one's amount of experience )Tj
T*(playing the game, and the role of experience may overwhelm the role of )Tj
T*(intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and )Tj
T*(possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; prolonged )Tj
T*(training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.[122] )Tj
T*( A 2007 study of young chess players in the United Kingdom found that strong )Tj
T*(players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the )Tj
T*(correlation between chess skill and IQ was actually moderately negative, )Tj
T*(meaning that smarter children tended to achieve a lower level of chess )Tj

T*( Chess variants are forms of chess where the game is played using a different )Tj
T*(board \(e.g. hexagonal chess or 3D chess\), different rules, or special fairy )Tj
T*(pieces. There are more than two thousand published variants, the most popular )Tj
T*(being xiangqi in China and shogi in Japan.[123][124] Chess variants can )Tj
T*(include, but are not limited to: )Tj
T*( direct predecessors of chess \(chaturanga and shatranj\);)Tj
T*(traditional national or regional variants like xiangqi, shogi, janggi \(Korea\), )Tj
T*(and makruk \(Thailand\), which share common predecessors with Western chess;)Tj
T*(modern variants such as Chess960, where the starting position is selected )Tj

T*(the December to Dismember event held by the original Extreme Championship )Tj
T*(Wrestling in 1995. )Tj
T*( The main attraction on the event card was an Extreme Elimination Chamber match )Tj
T*(for the ECW World Championship. It featured wrestlers fighting in a ring )Tj
T*(surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. The six participants were )Tj
T*(defending champion Big Show, Bobby Lashley, Rob Van Dam, Hardcore Holly, CM )Tj
T*(Punk and Test. Lashley won the match and the ECW World Championship after )Tj
T*(pinning Big Show following a spear.[3] The featured bout on the undercard was a )Tj
T*(tag team bout between The Hardys \(real-life brothers Matt and Jeff\) and MNM )Tj
T*(\(Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro\), in which The Hardys were victorious.[4] )Tj
T*( The event had an attendance of 4,800 and received about 90,000Â pay-per-view )Tj
T*(buys, with 55,000 of them domestic buysâ€”the lowest buyrate in WWE )Tj
T*(history.[5][6] Although it was scheduled to be held again in 2007, the show was )Tj
T*(canceled after all pay-per-view events became tri-branded, which meant that )Tj
T*(there would be pay-per-view events with the entire roster on two consecutive )Tj
T*(weeks.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( Outside of the weekly ECW on Sci Fi broadcast, one of WWE's primary television )Tj
T*(programs, the pay-per-view received little buildup on either the Raw or )Tj
T*(SmackDown! television shows, as WWE concentrated more on the Survivor Series )Tj
T*(pay-per-view that aired one week prior to December to Dismember.[8] At this )Tj
T*(time, the main storyline on the Raw brand featured tag teams D-Generation X and )Tj
T*(Rated-RKO,[9] and the main storyline on the SmackDown! brand featured Batista )Tj
T*(and World Heavyweight Champion King Booker.[10] The buildup for December to )Tj
T*(Dismember began in the middle of October, six weeks before the event )Tj
T*(occurred.[11] This was the only ECW brand exclusive pay-per-view produced by )Tj
T*(WWE before the decision was made to include wrestlers from all three brands on )Tj
T*(all pay-per-views.[12] )Tj
T*( The main event at December to Dismember featured an Extreme Elimination )Tj
T*(Chamber match. On the October 24, 2006 episode of ECW, Rob Van Dam won an )Tj
T*(opportunity at the ECW World Championship by defeating Big Show in a ladder )Tj
T*(match.[13] Van Dam traded in this championship opportunity at the December to )Tj
T*(Dismember pay-per-view.[14] Authority figure Paul Heyman authorized Van Dam's )Tj
T*(decision by adding him to the Extreme Elimination Chamber contest along with )Tj
T*(five other wrestlers, including the champion, Big Show.[15] The remaining four )Tj
T*(participants for the match were decided through standard wrestling matches. The )Tj
T*(first person to qualify for the Elimination Chamber was Sabu, who defeated )Tj
T*(Kevin Thorn on the October 31, 2006 episode of ECW.[15] The following week, CM )Tj
T*(Punk and Test qualified by defeating Mike Knox and Tommy Dreamer, )Tj
T*(respectively.[16] The final place was to be given to Hardcore Holly in a )Tj
T*(contract signing segment on the November 14, 2006 episode of ECW. As Holly was )Tj
T*(making his way to the ring, however, Bobby Lashley, a wrestler from the )Tj
T*(SmackDown! brand, attacked Holly and signed the contract himself to gain the )Tj
T*(sixth and final place in the Extreme Elimination Chamber.[17] Although the six )Tj
T*(spots in the bout were filled, Heyman announced a contest between Van Dam and )Tj
T*(Holly in an Extreme Rules match on the November 21, 2006 episode of ECW, with )Tj
T*(the stipulation that if Van Dam lost, Holly would get his spot in the Extreme )Tj
T*(Elimination Chamber; Van Dam however, won the match.[18] Van Dam continued his )Tj
T*(momentum into December to Dismember as he, along with team members Sabu, )Tj
T*(Lashley, John Cena and Kane defeated the team of Big Show, Test, Umaga, Finlay )Tj
T*(and Montel Vontavious Porter in a 5-on-5 elimination tag team match. The match )Tj
T*(took place at the Survivor Series event.[19] On the final episode of ECW before )Tj
T*(December to Dismember, Van Dam defeated Sabu. Later in the show, CM Punk faced )Tj
T*(Test, but both men were counted out in their bout. In the main event, Big Show )Tj
T*(was disqualified in his match against Lashley as Test and Heyman's Security )Tj
T*(Force \(Doug and Danny Basham\) assaulted Lashley, causing the )Tj
T*(disqualification.[20] )Tj
T*( The other main rivalry heading into December to Dismember was between brothers )Tj
T*(Matt and Jeff Hardy and MNM \(Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro and Melina\). Unlike the )Tj
T*(Extreme Elimination Chamber rivalry, this one did not include ECW wrestlers and )Tj

T*(was only between members of the Raw and SmackDown! brands, making the event )Tj
T*(span all three WWE brands.[20][21][22] The buildup began when Nitro and Jeff )Tj
T*(began to feud over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw.[23][24] The two )Tj
T*(competed in several different types of matches, including a ladder match.[9] )Tj
T*(The Hardys had just teamed up for the first time since 2002 on ECW, when they )Tj
T*(defeated Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido Maritato.[18] At Survivor Series, The )Tj
T*(Hardys, along with D-GenerationÂ X and CM Punk defeated the team of Nitro, )Tj
T*(Rated-RKO \(Edge and Randy Orton\), Mike Knox and Gregory Helms.[25] The next day )Tj
T*(at the December to Dismember press conference, The Hardys made an open )Tj
T*(challenge for the pay-per-view. Later that night on Raw, Nitro accepted the )Tj
T*(challenge, announcing the return of Mercury and the "one night only" )Tj
T*(reformation of MNM.[21] That Tuesday on ECW, MNM attacked The Hardys after they )Tj
T*(won their match against Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay.[20] Meanwhile, )Tj
T*(Voodoo Kin Mafia, a tag team from the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling \(TNA\) )Tj
T*(promotion, issued a statement via the TNA website stating that they accepted )Tj
T*(The Hardys' open challenge for December to Dismember.[26] Voodoo Kin Mafia did )Tj
T*(not turn up at the event, and WWE never acknowledged the challenge. Only two )Tj
T*(matches were officially announced for the pay-per-view before it aired.[2][27] )Tj
T*( Before the event went live on pay-per-view, Stevie Richards defeated RenÃ© )Tj
T*(DuprÃ©e in a dark match, a non-televised match used to generate excitement in )Tj
T*(the crowd.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Preliminary matches )Tj
T*( The first match that aired was the tag team encounter between MNM and The )Tj
T*(Hardys. After a back and forth match, which lasted over 20Â minutes, MNM )Tj
T*(performed a flapjack DDT on Jeff, a move that sees an opponent get pushed )Tj
T*(upwards in air by the tag team and then is forced to dive forward onto his own )Tj
T*(head. During a pinfall attempt, Matt interrupted and performed a double )Tj
T*(neckbreaker on MNM. Jeff then performed a Swanton bomb and pinned )Tj
T*(Nitro.[2][4][29] Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a "Striker's )Tj
T*(Rules" match, a match with "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no )Tj
T*(maneuvers off the top rope and, most importantly, no foul language".[2][30] )Tj
T*(Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster.[2][29] )Tj
T*( After the match, Sabu was depicted as injured backstage and unable to compete )Tj
T*(in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match.[31][32] His place was taken by )Tj
T*(Hardcore Holly.[2] In reality, however, it was rumored that Sabu had animosity )Tj
T*(surrounding him backstage and was said to be uninterested at television )Tj
T*(tapings. Rumors evolved stating that WWE viewed Sabu as being "useless" in )Tj
T*(normal matches and that he could only perform in matches that included "stunts )Tj
T*(and tables and they [WWE] don't respect him because of that". This was )Tj
T*(reportedly part of the reason he had been scripted to be easily defeated by )Tj
T*(Umaga on an episode of Raw a few weeks earlier.[9][33] WWE chairman Vince )Tj
T*(McMahon wanted to put Holly in the match, so Lashley would have more villains )Tj
T*(to overcome. Heyman was legitimately unhappy with the decision, saying that )Tj
T*(Sabu's high-flying wrestling would be "the ideal showcase" inside the Extreme )Tj
T*(Elimination Chamber.[27] The fans inside the James Brown Arena chanted )Tj
T*("bullshit" during the segment.[2] )Tj
T*( In the second tag-team match of the night, Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay )Tj
T*(defeated F.B.I. members Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke. Burke pinned )Tj
T*(Mamaluke after a Forward Russian legsweep on him.[34] After the match, Terkay )Tj
T*(performed a Muscle Buster on Maritato.[29] During this match, the fans inside )Tj
T*(the James Brown Arena chanted "TNA, TNA" \(a reference to WWE's rival )Tj
T*(professional wrestling promotion, as well as two of their performers utilizing )Tj
T*(the moves of Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe, respectively\).[2] A standard match )Tj
T*(between Daivari and Tommy Dreamer followed. The Great Khali accompanied Daivari )Tj
T*(to the ring for this match but was ejected from ringside early on for )Tj
T*(interfering. Daivari won the match using a roll-up. Khali came back out after )Tj
T*(the match had ended and grabbed Dreamer by the neck and gave him a chokebomb. )Tj
T*(EMTs came out to help Dreamer up, but he got up on his own and headed )Tj
T*(backstage.[2][29][35] )Tj
T*( The next match was an intergender tag team match between Kevin Thorn and Ariel )Tj

T*(against Mike Knox and Kelly Kelly. Before the match began, Kelly Kelly was )Tj
T*(shown wishing CM Punk, her on-screen crush, luck for the main event. The finish )Tj
T*(of the match came when Knox walked out on Kelly Kelly, leaving her on her own )Tj
T*(in the ring. Ariel performed a legsweep, a variation of a takedown, on Kelly )Tj
T*(Kelly for the pinfall.[29] Following the match, Ariel and Thorn then tried to )Tj
T*(attack Kelly Kelly, however, The Sandman interrupted and hit Thorn repeatedly )Tj
T*(with a kendo stick.[2][36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Main event match )Tj
T*( The final match was the Extreme Elimination Chamber main event for the ECW )Tj
T*(World Championship. Before it began, Paul Heyman came out to the ring and )Tj
T*(explained the rules of the match and said that there was a weapon in each of )Tj
T*(the four different pods that housed the wrestlers.[29] In a conversation )Tj
T*(backstage with Big Show before heading to the ring not seen by television )Tj
T*(viewers, Heyman revealed that for the first time in his professional career he )Tj
T*(was not motivated to give the promo.[27] Rob Van Dam and Hardcore Holly started )Tj
T*(off the match, and one of the other four competitors entered every five minutes )Tj
T*(afterward. The first person to be released from his pod was CM Punk, who )Tj
T*(entered the match with a steel chair in hand. Test came out five minutes after )Tj
T*(Punk with a crowbar. Punk was the first person eliminated from the match when )Tj
T*(Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash from the top turnbuckle. Moments )Tj
T*(later, Test charged at Holly and hit his head with his boot and pinned him. Van )Tj
T*(Dam was the third person eliminated by Test via a diving elbow drop from the )Tj
T*(top of a pod. When Bobby Lashley's pod was supposed to open, he could not get )Tj
T*(out of it because Heyman's Security Force had bolted the pod shut. Lashley used )Tj
T*(the table that was with him to smash the pod open, allowing him to escape. )Tj
T*(Lashley then hit Test with a spear to get a pinfall. Big Show was the final man )Tj
T*(to exit his pod and enter the match, with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed )Tj
T*(wire. Lashley blocked Big Show's swing of the bat with a folding chair and then )Tj
T*(threw Big Show into a pod, causing him to bleed. Lashley managed to turn an )Tj
T*(attempted chokeslam from Big Show into a DDT and then landed a spear to win the )Tj
T*(match and become the new ECW World Champion.[3][29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Not long after December to Dismember, Big Show was offered a long-term )Tj
T*(contract extension by WWE, reported to be around $1Â million a year. He turned )Tj
T*(it down, however, because he was burned out and hurting physically.[2][27][38] )Tj
T*(On the episode of ECW, which aired two days after December to Dismember, Show )Tj
T*(faced Lashley in an ECW World title rematch, which Show lost, thus ending their )Tj
T*(storyline feud.[39] He was not seen on WWE television thereafter, and his )Tj
T*(contract was not renewed before it expired in February 2007.[40] )Tj
T*( After the storyline feud with Big Show ended, Lashley entered a short program )Tj
T*(with Rob Van Dam, which led to Van Dam earning a title match on the January 2, )Tj
T*(2007 episode of ECW. The match between the two ended in a No Contest after Test )Tj
T*(interfered during the bout.[41] Test's interference led to a program with the )Tj
T*(champion, leading to a title match at the Royal Rumble, which Lashley won.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( Less than 24 hours after the pay-per-view, WWE announced on their official )Tj
T*(website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing "slumping television )Tj
T*(ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heymanâ€™s )Tj
T*(dismissal".[43] Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston )Tj
T*(Coliseum.[44] After a producers' meeting,[44] Heyman was escorted from the )Tj
T*(Coliseum and sent home. Heyman was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative )Tj
T*(team. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received )Tj
T*(pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman )Tj
T*(legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under )Tj
T*(contract.[44][45][46] Heyman was against Lashley being booked to win the ECW )Tj
T*(Championship, however, McMahon stated that fans would be happy to see a new )Tj
T*(champion and a 10-minute celebration.[27][44][47] In an early 2008 interview )Tj
T*(with The Sun, Heyman stated how he would have booked the Elimination Chamber )Tj
T*(main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big )Tj
T*(Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon disliked the idea, but )Tj

T*(Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the )Tj
T*(opportunity to "make" a rising star like Punk. Heyman also stated that he kept )Tj
T*(going to McMahon on the night of the pay-per-view to say that "The people are )Tj
T*(going to throw this back in our face".[44] Upset at how the event turned out, )Tj
T*(Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both asked after the event to be released )Tj
T*(from their contracts. Both requests were refused by McMahon and WWE's Vice )Tj
T*(President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis.[8] )Tj

T*(Together the pavilions generate 19,840 kilowatt-hours \(67,697Â MBtu\) of )Tj
T*(electricity annually,[1] worth about $2,350 per year.[2] )Tj
T*( The four pavilions, which cost $7 million,[3] were designed in January 2001; )Tj

T*(park, while the fourth serves as the park's welcome center and )Tj
T*(office.[5]Exelon, a company that generates the electricity transmitted by its )Tj

T*(as "nearly all black and impenetrable".[3] The North Pavilions have received )Tj
T*(the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \(LEED\) silver rating from the )Tj

T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park )Tj
T*(has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, )Tj
T*(north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of )Tj
T*(Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail )Tj
T*(yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development )Tj
T*(by the city as Millennium Park.[9] As of 2009, Millennium Park trailed only )Tj
T*(Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction.[10] )Tj
T*( In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated,[11] the Board of Canal )Tj
T*(Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Citizens with the )Tj
T*(foresight to keep the lakefront as public open space convinced the )Tj
T*(commissioners to designate the land east of Michigan Avenue between Randolph )Tj
T*(Street and Park Row \(11th Street\) "Public Groundâ€”A Common to Remain Forever )Tj
T*(Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever."[12] )Tj
T*(Grant Park has been "forever open, clear and free" since, protected by )Tj
T*(legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court )Tj
T*(rulings.[13][14][15] In 1839, United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts )Tj
T*(Poinsett decommissioned the Fort Dearborn reserve and declared the land between )Tj
T*(Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue "Public Ground )Tj
T*(forever to remain vacant of buildings".[11] )Tj
T*( Aaron Montgomery Ward, who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the )Tj
T*(protector of Grant Park, twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove )Tj

T*(ones.[16][17] In 1890, arguing that Michigan Avenue property owners held )Tj
T*(easements on the park land, Ward commenced legal actions to keep the park free )Tj
T*(of new buildings. In 1900, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded that all )Tj
T*(landfill east of Michigan Avenue was subject to dedications and easements.[18] )Tj
T*(In 1909, when he sought to prevent the construction of the Field Museum of )Tj
T*(Natural History in the center of the park, the courts affirmed his arguments )Tj
T*(and the museum was built elsewhere.[19][20][21] )Tj
T*( As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height )Tj
T*(restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park; structures over 40 feet )Tj
T*(\(12Â m\) tall are not allowed in the park, with the exception of bandshells.[22] )Tj
T*(However, within Millennium Park, the 50-foot \(15Â m\) Crown Fountain and the )Tj
T*(139-foot \(42Â m\) Jay Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, )Tj
T*(because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. )Tj
T*(Shorter structures do not run afoul of the height restrictions. The Harris )Tj
T*(Theater, which lies between the North Pavilions, was built mostly underground )Tj
T*(to avoid the restrictions.[23][24] The Northwest Pavilion, tallest of the four, )Tj
T*(is three stories high; the Northeast Pavilion is two stories, and the South )Tj
T*(Pavilions are each one story.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Design and construction )Tj
T*( The pavilions are named for Exelon, a Chicago-based company that generates the )Tj
T*(electricity transmitted by its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison \(ComEd\).[3] The )Tj
T*(city of Chicago has collaborated with Exelon and ComEd on a variety of )Tj
T*(environmental projects, including the installation of solar power in buildings, )Tj
T*(support for sustainable design and renewable energy, and furthering educational )Tj
T*(and social awareness of green architecture in the city.[8] The pavilions cost )Tj
T*($7Â million,[3] $5.5Â million of which was donated by Exelon and ComEd.[1] )Tj
T*( The lead designer for the North Pavilions was Thomas H. Beeby of Hammond Beeby )Tj
T*(Rupert Ainge Architects.[4] Beeby's designs for the North Pavilions are "in )Tj
T*(harmony with the Harris Theater",[25] for which he was the architect as well. )Tj
T*(The North Pavilions are along Randolph Street on either side of the theater, )Tj
T*(which is Millennium Park's indoor performing-arts venue.[4] )Tj
T*( The South Pavilions were designed by architect Renzo Piano of Renzo Piano )Tj
T*(Building Workshop.[4] Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern )Tj
T*(Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in )Tj
T*(2009. The facades of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order to )Tj
T*(complement the Modern Wing, even though it was not completed until several )Tj
T*(years after the pavilions were finished.[1] Piano also designed the Nichols )Tj
T*(Bridgeway, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to )Tj
T*(the Southwest Pavilion.[26] )Tj
T*( The design process for the Exelon Pavilions began in September 2001, with )Tj
T*(construction starting in January 2004. The general contractor for all four )Tj
T*(pavilions was Walsh Construction. The South Pavilions were completed in July )Tj
T*(2004 and opened when Millennium Park celebrated its grand opening on July 16, )Tj
T*(2004. The North Pavilions were not finished in July 2004, but were completed in )Tj
T*(November of that year. All four Exelon Pavilions were officially opened to the )Tj
T*(public on April 30, 2005.[3][4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Structures )Tj
T*( The North Pavilions were designed as minimalist black cubes,[5] and together )Tj
T*(are capable of producing 16,000 kilowatt-hours \(54,594 MBtu\) of electricity )Tj
T*(annually.[1] The outermost layer of the exterior of each pavilion is a curtain )Tj
T*(wall made of recycled aluminum. These walls contain specially designed )Tj
T*("mono-crystalline photovoltaic modules and insulated glass".[27]Convection from )Tj
T*(radiant solar heat gain causes air to cycle within air cavities covered by the )Tj
T*(photovoltaic modules. A "highly heat-reflective thermoplastic membrane" is used )Tj
T*(to waterproof each roof, and helps mitigate the urban heat island effect.[27] )Tj
T*( The photovoltaic modules generate electricity to power much of the pavilions' )Tj

T*( [edit] Northwest Pavilion )Tj
T*( The Northwest Pavilion, located at 151 E. Randolph Street,[28] houses the )Tj
T*(Millennium Park Welcome Center and an Exelon energy display.[5] It contains the )Tj
T*(Millennium Park offices, and public restrooms.[1] The three-story Northwest )Tj
T*(Pavilion is the largest of the four pavilions, with 6,100 square feet \(566.7Â )Tj
T*(m2\),[4] and is the only pavilion that does not provide access to the parking )Tj
T*(garage below.[5] The Northwest Pavilion has 460 photovoltaic modules to harness )Tj
T*(solar energy, houses recycling facilities, and its "interior finishes and )Tj
T*(construction materials are derived from renewable resources".[1] )Tj
T*( The Millennium Park Welcome Center in the Northwest Pavilion offers guides to )Tj
T*(the park and wheelchairs. It houses exhibitions on parks and energy, and has )Tj
T*(interactive displays on how the pavilions' solar panels function and on )Tj
T*(renewable energy. There are exhibits with interactive web-based touch screens )Tj
T*(that depict the city's use of solar energy, and a dynamic multi-screen video )Tj
T*(presentation on electricity generation and usage. The building's atrium )Tj
T*(includes a sculpture by Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and Adelheid Mers )Tj
T*(with three backlit 9-foot \(2.7Â m\) two-way mirrors. The sculpture, titled )Tj
T*(Heliosphere, Biosphere, Technosphere, is "designed to interpret the links )Tj
T*(between the Earth's atmosphere, the solar system and scientific )Tj
T*(applications".[1] It is the only permanent work of art by Chicago artists )Tj
T*(within the park.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Northeast Pavilion )Tj
T*( The Northeast Pavilion houses a pedestrian entrance to the Millennium Park )Tj
T*(parking garage,[1] and provides access to the Harris Theater's rooftop )Tj
T*(terrace.[8][28] It is at 201 E. Randolph Street, east of the theater and west )Tj
T*(of the McDonald's Cycle Center. The pavilion's second floor has the Chicago )Tj
T*(Shop, which offers a self-guided Millennium Park audio tour for rental and )Tj
T*(sells official Millennium Park and Chicago souvenirs.[30] The two-story )Tj
T*(Northeast Pavilion is the second-largest, with 4,100 square feet \(380.9Â m2\) of )Tj
T*(surface area,[4] and also has 460 photovoltaic modules to generate electricity )Tj
T*(from sunlight.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] South Pavilions )Tj
T*( The south pavilions are east and west of the Lurie Garden along Monroe Street, )Tj
T*(and their glass walls allow views of the garden.[3] Both of the South Pavilions )Tj
T*(provide access to the parking garage below the park. The 550-square-foot \(51Â )Tj
T*(m2\) Southwest Pavilion is the smallest of the four pavilions,[4] and has the )Tj
T*(least number of photovoltaic modules with 16 on its roof.[1] It is west of the )Tj
T*(garden and east of the Nichols Bridgeway. The Southeast Pavilion is east of the )Tj
T*(garden, has the second smallest area at 750 square feet \(69.7Â m2\),[4] and has )Tj
T*(24 rooftop photovoltaic modules. Together these two pavilions are capable of )Tj
T*(producing 3,840 kilowatt-hours \(13,102.6Â MBtu\) of electricity annually.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception and recognition )Tj
T*( Pulitzer Prize-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin praised )Tj
T*(the decision to have architects design the pavilions as an "inspired stroke", )Tj
T*(speculating that if their designs had been left to contractors, visitors to )Tj
T*(Millennium Park could have instead seen unimpressive "blunt utilitarian )Tj
T*(huts".[3] Kamin was pleased with Piano's South Pavilions, describing them as )Tj
T*("minor modernist jewels, almost house-like".[3] He lauded the way their )Tj
T*(limestone walls complement the transparent glass by way of contrast, and noted )Tj
T*(that they anticipated Piano's then-forthcoming addition to the Art Institute of )Tj
T*(Chicago Building. Kamin gave the South Pavilions a rating of three stars out of )Tj
T*(a possible four, or "very good".[3] )Tj
T*( Kamin was less pleased with Beeby's North Pavilions, which he described as )Tj
T*("nearly all black and impenetrable" and compared to Darth Vader's helmet.[3] He )Tj
T*(did acknowledge the pavilions' innovative technology, and their "urban design )Tj
T*(function" as wings for the Harris Theater, which Kamin felt "allows the theater )Tj
T*(to better stand up to the Frank Gehry-designed Pritzker Pavilion to its )Tj
T*(south".[3] Because they were not finished when he wrote his review in July )Tj
T*(2004, Kamin did not give the North Pavilions an overall star rating; he did )Tj

T*( Yellowstone National Park \(Arapaho: Henihco'oo' or HÃ©etÃ­hco'oo[4]\), )Tj
T*(established by the U.S.Â Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. )Tj
T*(Grant on March 1, 1872,[5][6] is a national park located primarily in the U.S. )Tj
T*(state of Wyoming, although it also extends into Montana and Idaho. Yellowstone, )Tj
T*(widely held to be the first national park in the world,[7] is known for its )Tj
T*(wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially Old Faithful Geyser, one )Tj
T*(of the most popular features in the park.[8] It has many types of ecosystems, )Tj
T*(but the subalpine forest is dominant. )Tj
T*( Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000Â )Tj
T*(years.[9] The region was bypassed during the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the )Tj
T*(early 19th century. Aside from visits by mountain men during the )Tj
T*(early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late )Tj
T*(1860s. The U.S. Army was commissioned to oversee the park just after its )Tj
T*(establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the )Tj
T*(National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of )Tj
T*(structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and )Tj
T*(historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 )Tj
T*(archaeological sites. )Tj
T*( Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles \(8,983Â )Tj
T*(km2\),[1] comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and mountain ranges.[8]Yellowstone )Tj
T*(Lake is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered )Tj
T*(over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The )Tj
T*(caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force )Tj
T*(several times in the last two million years.[10] Half of the world's geothermal )Tj
T*(features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism.[11]Lava flows )Tj
T*(and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. )Tj
T*(The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest )Tj
T*(remaining, nearly intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[12] )Tj
T*( Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, )Tj
T*(including several that are either endangered or threatened.[8] The vast forests )Tj
T*(and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the )Tj
T*(largest and most famous megafauna location in the Continental United States. )Tj
T*(Grizzly bears, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in the )Tj
T*(park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison )Tj
T*(herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the )Tj
T*(large forest fires of 1988, nearly one third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone )Tj
T*(has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, )Tj
T*(fishing and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major )Tj
T*(geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the )Tj
T*(winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either )Tj
T*(snow coaches or snowmobile. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The park is located at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, from which it )Tj
T*(takes its historical name. Near the end of the 18th century, French trappers )Tj
T*(named the river "Roche Jaune," which is probably a translation of the )Tj
T*(Minnetaree name "Mi tsi a-da-zi" \(Rock Yellow River\).[13] Later, American )Tj
T*(trappers rendered the French name in English as "Yellow Stone." Although it is )Tj
T*(commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the )Tj
T*(Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the Native American name source is not )Tj
T*(clear.[14] )Tj
T*( The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal )Tj
T*(Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction )Tj
T*(of the post office in Gardiner, Montana, in the 1950s, an obsidian projectile )Tj
T*(point of Clovis origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years )Tj
T*(ago.[15] These Paleo-Indians, of the Clovis culture, used the significant )Tj

T*(amounts of obsidian found in the park to make such cutting tools and weapons. )Tj
T*(Arrowheads made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the )Tj
T*(Mississippi Valley, indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between )Tj
T*(local tribes and tribes farther east.[16] By the time white explorers first )Tj
T*(entered the region during the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805, they )Tj
T*(encountered the Nez Perce, Crow and Shoshone tribes. While passing through )Tj
T*(present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone )Tj
T*(region to the south, but they did not investigate it.[16] )Tj
T*( In 1806, John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, left to join )Tj
T*(a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, )Tj
T*(Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the )Tj
T*(winter of 1807â€“1808. He observed at least one geothermal area in the )Tj
T*(northeastern section of the park, near Tower Fall.[17] After surviving wounds )Tj
T*(he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and Blackfoot tribes in 1809, )Tj
T*(he gave a description of a place of "fire and brimstone" that was dismissed by )Tj
T*(most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "Colter's )Tj
T*(Hell". Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and )Tj
T*(trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and petrified trees, yet most of )Tj
T*(these reports were believed at the time to be myth.[18] )Tj
T*( After an 1856 exploration, mountain man Jim Bridger \(also believed to be the )Tj
T*(first or second European American to have seen the Great Salt Lake\) reported )Tj
T*(observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow )Tj
T*(rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a )Tj
T*("spinner of yarns". In 1859, Captain William F. Raynolds, U.S. Army surveyor )Tj
T*(embarked on a two-year survey of the northern Rockies. After wintering in )Tj
T*(Wyoming, in May 1860, Raynolds and his party which included naturalist )Tj
T*(Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and guide Jim Bridger attempted to cross the )Tj
T*(Continental Divide over Two Ocean Plateau from the Wind River drainage in )Tj
T*(northwest Wyoming. Heavy spring snows prevented their passage but had they been )Tj
T*(able to traverse the divide, the party would have been the first organized )Tj
T*(survey to enter the Yellowstone region.[19] The American Civil War hampered )Tj
T*(further organized explorations until the late 1860s.[20] )Tj
T*( The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the )Tj
T*(Cookâ€“Folsomâ€“Peterson Expedition of 1869, which consisted of three privately )Tj
T*(funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to )Tj
T*(Yellowstone Lake.[21] The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based )Tj
T*(on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the )Tj
T*(Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870. It was headed by the )Tj
T*(surveyor-general of Montana Henry Washburn, and included Nathaniel P. Langford )Tj
T*(\(who later became known as "National Park" Langford\) and a U.S. Army detachment )Tj
T*(commanded by Lt.Â Gustavus Doane. )Tj
T*( The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, )Tj
T*(and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius )Tj
T*(Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the )Tj
T*(region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number )Tj
T*(of detailed articles about his observations for the Helena Herald newspaper )Tj
T*(between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October )Tj
T*(1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor Thomas Francis Meagher, who had )Tj
T*(previously commented that the region should be protected.[22] Others made )Tj
T*(similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from Jay Cooke to Ferdinand V. Hayden, )Tj
T*(Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman William D. Kelley had also suggested )Tj
T*("Congress pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park )Tj
T*(forever".[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Park creation )Tj
T*( In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, Ferdinand V. Hayden was )Tj
T*(finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government )Tj
T*(sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger )Tj
T*(expedition, the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. He compiled a comprehensive )Tj
T*(report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by William Henry )Tj
T*(Jackson, as well as paintings by Thomas Moran. His report helped to convince )Tj

T*(the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction. On March 1, )Tj
T*(1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed The Act of Dedication[6] law that )Tj
T*(created Yellowstone National Park.[24] )Tj
T*( Hayden, while not the only person to have thought of creating a park in the )Tj
T*(Yellowstone region, was the park's first and most enthusiastic advocate.[25] He )Tj
T*(believed in "setting aside the area as a pleasure ground for the benefit and )Tj
T*(enjoyment of the people" and warned that there were those who would come and )Tj
T*("make merchandise of these beautiful specimens".[25] Worrying the area could )Tj
T*(face the same fate as Niagara Falls, he concluded the site should "be as free )Tj
T*(as the air or Water."[25] In his report to the Committee on Public Lands, he )Tj
T*(concluded that if the bill failed to become law, "the vandals who are now )Tj
T*(waiting to enter into this wonder-land, will in a single season despoil, beyond )Tj
T*(recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which have requited all the cunning )Tj
T*(skill of nature thousands of years to prepare".[26] )Tj
T*( [27] Hayden and his 1871 party recognized that Yellowstone was a priceless )Tj
T*(treasure, which would become rarer with time. He wished for others to see and )Tj
T*(experience it as well. Eventually the railroads and, some time after that, the )Tj
T*(automobile would make that possible. The Park was not set aside strictly for )Tj
T*(ecological purposes; however, the designation "pleasure ground" was not an )Tj
T*(invitation to create an amusement park. Hayden imagined something akin to the )Tj

T*( There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park )Tj
T*(during its early years: some locals feared that the regional economy would be )Tj
T*(unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource )Tj
T*(development or settlement within park boundaries; local entrepreneurs advocated )Tj
T*(reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities )Tj
T*(could be developed[29] and numerous bills were introduced into Congress by )Tj
T*(Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use )Tj
T*(restrictions.[30] )Tj
T*( After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the )Tj
T*(park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a )Tj
T*(salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or )Tj
T*(properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few )Tj
T*(legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to )Tj
T*(poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the )Tj
T*(practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the )Tj
T*(Secretary of the Interior[31] and correctly predicted that Yellowstone will )Tj
T*(become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of )Tj

T*(resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the )Tj
T*(Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other )Tj
T*(expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. )Tj
T*(Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides. )Tj
T*("It is estimated that during the winter of 1874â€“1875, not less than 3,000 )Tj
T*(buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope )Tj
T*(nearly as much."[32] )Tj
T*( As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877.[33][34] Having traveled )Tj
T*(through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand, Philetus )Tj
T*(Norris volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally )Tj
T*(saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal )Tj
T*(funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the )Tj
T*(park, building numerous crude roads and facilities.[34] )Tj
T*( In 1880, Harry Yount was appointed as a gamekeeper to control poaching and )Tj
T*(vandalism in the park. Yount had previously spent a number of years exploring )Tj
T*(the mountain country of present-day Wyoming, including the Grand Tetons, after )Tj
T*(joining F V. Hayden's Geological Survey in 1873.[35] Today, he is considered )Tj
T*(the first national park ranger,[36] and Younts Peak, located at the head of the )Tj
T*(Yellowstone River, was named in his honor.[37] However, these measures still )Tj
T*(proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the )Tj
T*(three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or )Tj
T*(resources. )Tj
T*( The Northern Pacific Railroad built a train station in Livingston, Montana, )Tj
T*(connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to )Tj
T*(increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883.[38] Visitors in these )Tj
T*(early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access )Tj
T*(into the park was on horse or via stagecoach. By 1908 visitation increased )Tj
T*(enough to also attract a Union Pacific Railroad connection to West Yellowstone, )Tj
T*(though rail visitation fell off considerably by World War II and ceased around )Tj
T*(the 1960s. Much of the railroad line was converted to nature trails, among them )Tj
T*(the Yellowstone Branch Line Trail. )Tj
T*( During the 1870s and 1880s Native American tribes were effectively excluded )Tj
T*(from the national park. A number of tribes had made seasonal use of the )Tj
T*(Yellowstone area, but the only year-round residents were small bands of Western )Tj
T*(Shoshone known as "Sheepeaters". They left the area under the assurances of a )Tj
T*(treaty negotiated in 1868, under which the Sheepeaters ceded their lands but )Tj
T*(retained the right to hunt in Yellowstone. The United States never ratified the )Tj
T*(treaty and refused to recognize the claims of the Sheepeaters or any other )Tj
T*(tribe that had made use of Yellowstone.[39] The Nez Perce band associated with )Tj
T*(Chief Joseph, numbering about 750 people, passed through Yellowstone National )Tj
T*(Park in thirteen days during late August 1877. They were being pursued by the )Tj
T*(U.S.Â Army and entered the national park about two weeks after the Battle of the )Tj
T*(Big Hole. Some of the Nez Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people )Tj
T*(they encountered in the park, some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly )Tj
T*(taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that no one should be )Tj
T*(harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded.[40][41] One of the )Tj
T*(areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a )Tj
T*(branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond.[40] That stream is )Tj
T*(still known as Nez Perce Creek.[42] A group of Bannocks entered the park in )Tj
T*(1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the )Tj
T*(Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort for the purpose of )Tj
T*(preventing Native Americans from entering the national park.[39][41] )Tj
T*( Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until )Tj
T*(the U.S.Â Army arrived at Mammoth Hot Springs in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. )Tj
T*(Over the next 22Â years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp )Tj
T*(Sheridan was renamed Fort Yellowstone.[43] With the funding and manpower )Tj
T*(necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and )Tj
T*(regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and )Tj
T*(natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of )Tj
T*(the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new )Tj

T*( Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is )Tj
T*(located within the state of Wyoming. Another three percent is within Montana, )Tj
T*(with the remaining one percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles \(101Â km\) north to )Tj

T*(\(898,317Â ha; 3,468.420Â sqÂ mi\)[1] in area, larger than the states of Rhode )Tj
T*(Island or Delaware. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with )Tj
T*(the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres \(35,220Â ha; )Tj
T*(136.00Â sqÂ mi\). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet \(120Â m\) deep and has 110 )Tj
T*(miles \(180Â km\) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet \(2,357Â m\) above sea )Tj
T*(level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. )Tj
T*(Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is )Tj
T*(grassland.[8] )Tj
T*( The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally through the )Tj
T*(southwestern part of the park. The divide is a topographic feature that )Tj
T*(separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About one third of )Tj
T*(the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone )Tj
T*(and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a )Tj
T*(result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of )Tj
T*(the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico. )Tj
T*( The park sits on the Yellowstone Plateau, at an average elevation of 8,000 )Tj
T*(feet \(2,400Â m\) above sea level. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by )Tj
T*(mountain ranges of the Middle Rocky Mountains, which range from 9,000 to 11,000 )Tj
T*(feet \(2,700 to 3,400 m\) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop )Tj
T*(Eagle Peak \(11,358 feetÂ / 3,462 metres\) and the lowest is along Reese Creek )Tj
T*(\(5,282 feetÂ / 1,610 metres\).[8] Nearby mountain ranges include the Gallatin )Tj
T*(Range to the northwest, the Beartooth Mountains in the north, the Absaroka )Tj
T*(Range to the east, and the Teton Range and the Madison Range to the southwest )Tj
T*(and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is Mount )Tj
T*(Washburn at 10,243 feet \(3,122Â m\). )Tj
T*( Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest petrified forests, )Tj
T*(trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to )Tj
T*(mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris, are believed to have )Tj
T*(come from the park area itself. This is largely due to the fact that )Tj
T*(Yellowstone is actually a massive caldera of a supervolcano. There are 290 )Tj
T*(waterfalls of at least 15 feet \(4.6Â m\) in the park, the highest being the Lower )Tj
T*(Falls of the Yellowstone River at 308 feet \(94Â m\).[8] )Tj
T*( Three deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of )Tj

T*(depression, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, )Tj
T*(usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three )Tj

T*( [edit] Forest fires )Tj
T*( Wildfire is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone )Tj
T*(have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir has a thick bark which protects )Tj
T*(the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines â€”the most common )Tj
T*(tree species in the parkâ€” generally have cones that are only opened by the heat )Tj
T*(of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in )Tj
T*(melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and )Tj
T*(down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine )Tj
T*(Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder )Tj
T*(and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new )Tj
T*(growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, )Tj
T*(the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by )Tj
T*(soil.[99] The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, )Tj
T*(grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while )Tj
T*(forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.[99] )Tj
T*( About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, )Tj
T*(while another six to ten are started by peopleâ€” in most cases by accident. )Tj
T*(Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by )Tj
T*(trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though )Tj
T*(it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies )Tj
T*(on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames.[100] Fire towers are staffed almost )Tj
T*(continuously from late June to mid-Septemberâ€” the primary fire season. Fires )Tj
T*(burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires )Tj
T*(burn more than 100 acres \(40Â ha\), and the vast majority of fires reach only a )Tj
T*(little over an acre \(0.5Â ha\) before they burn themselves out.[101] Fire )Tj
T*(management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree )Tj
T*(moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire )Tj
T*(should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to )Tj
T*(evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the )Tj
T*(ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and )Tj
T*(structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is )Tj
T*(performed.[102] )Tj
T*( In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to )Tj
T*(people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential )Tj
T*(for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started )Tj
T*(to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity )Tj

T*(little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. )Tj
T*(Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was )Tj

T*(had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage.[52] )Tj
T*(Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the )Tj

T*( Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very )Tj

T*(40,000â€“50,000\), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. )Tj
T*(Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management )Tj

T*( [edit] Recreation )Tj
T*( Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. )Tj
T*(Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost )Tj
T*(every year.[109] In 2010, a record number of visitors came to the park in July: )Tj
T*(975,000. July is the busiest month for Yellowstone National Park.[110] At peak )Tj
T*(summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park )Tj
T*(concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of )Tj
T*(2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores )Tj
T*(and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or )Tj
T*(seasonally for the National Park Service.[8] )Tj
T*( Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has )Tj
T*(produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term )Tj
T*(road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the )Tj
T*(winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from Gardiner, Montana, and )Tj
T*(extends to Cooke City, Montana, are closed to wheeled vehicles.[111] Park roads )Tj
T*(are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park )Tj
T*(roads remain closed until mid-May.[112] The park has 310 miles \(500Â km\) of )Tj
T*(paved roads which can be accessed from five different entrances.[8] There is no )Tj
T*(public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can )Tj
T*(be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires )Tj
T*(operate guided snowmobile and snow coach tours, though their numbers and access )Tj
T*(are based on quotas established by the National Park Service.[113] Facilities )Tj
T*(in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very )Tj
T*(busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by )Tj
T*(people observing wildlife can result in long delays. )Tj
T*( The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is )Tj
T*(responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other )Tj
T*(2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as )Tj
T*(the Old Faithful Inn built from 1903 to 1904 and the entire Fort Yellowstone â€“ )Tj
T*(Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District. An historical and educational tour is )Tj
T*(available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park )Tj
T*(Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and )Tj
T*(other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the )Tj
T*(summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons. )Tj
T*( Camping is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites.[8] )Tj
T*(Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand )Tj
T*(Teton National Park to the south. Backcountry campsites are accessible only by )Tj
T*(foot or by horseback and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles \(1,800Â km\) of )Tj
T*(hiking trails available.[114] The park is not considered to be a good )Tj
T*(destination for mountaineering because of the instability of volcanic rock )Tj
T*(which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at )Tj
T*(all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in "frontcountry" zones )Tj
T*(such as drive in campgrounds.[115] Around thermal features, wooden and paved )Tj
T*(trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas )Tj
T*(are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round )Tj
T*(clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the )Tj
T*(year.[116] )Tj
T*( Hunting is not permitted, though it is allowed in the surrounding national )Tj
T*(forests during open season. Fishing is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone )Tj
T*(Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters.[117] Many park waters )Tj
T*(are fly fishing only and all native fish species are catch and release )Tj
T*(only.[118] Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 miles \(8.0Â )Tj
T*(km\) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lake, and it is open )Tj
T*(to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the )Tj
T*(most popular boating destination.[119] )Tj
T*( In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even )Tj
T*(encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and )Tj
T*(visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to )Tj

T*(numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their )Tj
T*(policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of )Tj
T*(close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to )Tj
T*(find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become )Tj
T*(more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries )Tj
T*(and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger.[120] )Tj
T*( Other protected lands in the region include Caribou-Targhee, Gallatin, Custer, )Tj
T*(Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's John )Tj
T*(D. Rockefeller,Â Jr. Memorial Parkway is to the south and leads to Grand Teton )Tj

T*(and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include West )Tj

T*(Idaho.[121]Salt Lake City, 320 miles \(510Â km\) to the south, is the closest )Tj
T*(large metropolitan area. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legal jurisdiction )Tj
T*( The entire park is within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court )Tj
T*(for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that )Tj
T*(includes portions of more than one state \(Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming\). Law )Tj
T*(professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury )Tj
T*(in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime )Tj
T*(committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park \(and that it )Tj
T*(would be difficult to do so for a crime committed solely in the )Tj
T*(lightly-populated Montana portion\).[122] One defendant accused of a )Tj
T*(wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park attempted to raise )Tj
T*(this argument.[123] He eventually pleaded guilty.[124] )Tj

T*( Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Richard Rodgers and )Tj
T*(Oscar Hammerstein II. It was based on the 1957 novel, The Flower Drum Song, by )Tj
T*(Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee. The piece opened in 1958 on Broadway and was )Tj
T*(afterwards presented in the West End and on tour. It was subsequently made into )Tj
T*(a 1961 musical film. )Tj
T*( After their extraordinary early successes, beginning with Oklahoma! in 1943, )Tj
T*(Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do )Tj
T*(well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a )Tj
T*(father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional )Tj
T*(values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus )Tj
T*(of the musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and )Tj
T*(assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut )Tj
T*(as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable )Tj
T*(Asian â€“ or at least, plausibly Asian-looking â€“ cast. The musical, much more )Tj
T*(light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by )Tj
T*(a national tour. )Tj
T*( After the release of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, )Tj
T*(as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take )Tj
T*(offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and )Tj
T*(songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to )Tj
T*(Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang )Tj
T*(\(but retaining most of the original songs\) was presented after a successful Los )Tj
T*(Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the )Tj
T*(inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic )Tj
T*(relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six )Tj
T*(months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( C.Y. Lee fled war-torn China in the 1940s and came to the United States, where )Tj
T*(he attended Yale University's playwriting program, graduating in 1947 with an )Tj
T*(M.F.A. degree. By the 1950s, he was barely making a living writing short )Tj
T*(stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San )Tj
T*(Francisco Chinatown newspapers.[1] He had hoped to break into playwriting, but )Tj
T*(instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, The Flower Drum Song \(originally titled )Tj
T*(Grant Avenue\). Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent )Tj
T*(submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. The firm )Tj
T*(sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation. The reader was found )Tj
T*(dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words "Read this" scrawled on )Tj
T*(it. The publishing house did so, and bought Lee's novel, which became a )Tj
T*(bestseller in 1957.[2][3] )Tj
T*( Lee's novel centers on Wang Chi-yang, a 63-year-old man who fled China to )Tj
T*(avoid the communists. The wealthy refugee lives in a house in Chinatown with )Tj

T*(a regular visitor and urges Wang to adopt Western ways. While his sons and )Tj
T*(sister-in-law are integrating into American culture, Wang stubbornly resists )Tj
T*(assimilation and speaks only two words of English, "Yes" and "No". Wang also )Tj
T*(has a severe cough, which he does not wish to have cured, feeling that it gives )Tj
T*(him authority in his household. Wang's elder son, Wang Ta, woos Linda Tung, but )Tj

T*(themselves by singing depressing flower drum songs on the street. Ta invites )Tj
T*(the two into the Wang household, with his father's approval, and he and May Li )Tj
T*(fall in love. He vows to marry her after she is falsely accused by the )Tj
T*(household servants of stealing a clock, though his father forbids it. Wang )Tj
T*(struggles to understand the conflicts that have torn his household apart; his )Tj
T*(hostility toward assimilation is isolating him from his family. In the end, )Tj
T*(taking his son's advice, Wang decides not to go to the herbalist to seek a )Tj
T*(remedy for his cough, but walks to a Chinese-run Western clinic, symbolizing )Tj
T*(that he is beginning to accept American culture.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Genesis of the musical )Tj
T*( Rodgers and Hammerstein, despite extraordinary early successes, such as )Tj
T*(Oklahoma!, Carousel and South Pacific, had suffered back-to-back Broadway flops )Tj
T*(in the mid-1950s with Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream.[5] While Oklahoma! had )Tj
T*(broken new ground in 1943, any new project in the late 1950s would have to )Tj
T*(compete with modern musicals and techniques, like the brutal realism in West )Tj
T*(Side Story,[6] and with other Broadway musical hits such as The Music Man, My )Tj
T*(Fair Lady and The Pajama Game.[7] Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their )Tj
T*(rule to begin work on their next musical as soon as the last opened on )Tj
T*(Broadway, but by the start of 1957, six months after Pipe Dream closed, the )Tj
T*(pair had no new stage musical in prospect. They had, however, been working )Tj
T*(since 1956 on the popular television version of Cinderella, which was broadcast )Tj
T*(on CBS on March 31, 1957.[8] Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for )Tj
T*(cancer in a tooth socket, and he was drinking heavily[9] and suffering from )Tj
T*(depression.[10] In June 1957, Rodgers checked himself in to Payne Whitney )Tj
T*(Psychiatric Clinic, and he remained there for twelve weeks. According to his )Tj
T*(daughters, Mary and Linda, this did not put a stop to his drinking.[11] )Tj
T*( Hammerstein, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles at the filming of South Pacific. )Tj
T*(While at the commissary, he met longtime friend, Joe Fields, who mentioned that )Tj
T*(he was negotiating for the rights to The Flower Drum Song. Intrigued by the )Tj
T*(title, Hammerstein asked for a copy of the novel, and decided that it had )Tj
T*(potential as a musical â€“ the lyricist described it as "sort of a Chinese Life )Tj
T*(with Father". Hammerstein consulted with Rodgers, and they agreed to make it )Tj
T*(their next work, to be written and produced in association with Fields.[12] )Tj
T*(Hammerstein began work in mid-1958. In July, however, he fell ill and was )Tj
T*(hospitalized for a month. This forced him to hurry his writing, as the )Tj
T*(production team had hoped to have the show in rehearsal by the start of )Tj
T*(September; this was postponed by two weeks. In interviews, however, Hammerstein )Tj
T*(pointed out that he had, when necessary, written songs for previous shows while )Tj
T*(in rehearsals for them.[13] )Tj
T*( The musical retained Lee's "central theme â€“ a theme coursing through much )Tj
T*(20th-century American literature: the conflict between Old World immigrants and )Tj
T*(their New World offspring".[14] Hammerstein and Fields shifted the focus of the )Tj
T*(story, however, from the elder Wang, who is central to Lee's novel, to his son )Tj
T*(Ta. They also removed the darker elements of Lee's work, including Helen Chao's )Tj
T*(suicide after her desperate fling with Ta, added the festive nightclub subplot )Tj
T*(and emphasized the romantic elements of the story.[15] According to David Lewis )Tj

T*(in his book about the musical, "Mr. Hammerstein and his colleagues were )Tj
T*(evidently in no mood to write a musical drama or even to invest their comedic )Tj
T*(approach with dramatic counterpoint of the sort that Jud Fry had given )Tj
T*(Oklahoma!Â ... [They] took the safest commercial route by following the eldest )Tj
T*(son's search for love â€“ the most popular theme at the time with Broadway )Tj
T*(audiences."[15] Lewis notes that Chao's role, though diminished in the musical, )Tj
T*(nevertheless gives it some of its darkest moments, and she serves much the same )Tj
T*(purpose as Jud Fry: to be, in Hammerstein's words, "the bass fiddle that gives )Tj
T*(body to the orchestration of the story".[16] Though the new story was less )Tj
T*(artistically adventurous than the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein hits, it was )Tj
T*(innovative, even daring in its treatment of Asian-Americans, "an ethnic group )Tj
T*(that had long been harshly caricatured and marginalized in our mainstream pop )Tj
T*(culture."[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] 1958 plot )Tj
T*( Act I: Wang Ta, a young Chinese-American man living in his father's house in )Tj
T*(San Francisco's Chinatown, discusses the problems of finding a wife with his )Tj
T*(aunt, Madam Liang \("You Are Beautiful"\) before hurrying off on a blind date. )Tj
T*(Nightclub owner Sammy Fong arrives with an offer for Ta's immigrant father, )Tj
T*(Master Wang, a very old-fashioned Chinatown elder. Sammy's picture bride has )Tj
T*(just arrived from China, illegally, but the shy Mei Li is clearly the wrong )Tj
T*(girl for Sammy, who already has an assertive girlfriend, a characteristic he )Tj
T*(likes. Sammy offers to sign the contract over to the Wang family: this would )Tj
T*(free Sammy from the contract and arrange a suitable wife for Ta. Sammy has )Tj
T*(taken the liberty of bringing the girl and her father with him; Wang is charmed )Tj
T*(\("A Hundred Million Miracles"\) and invites them to live in his home on the )Tj
T*(understanding that if the proposed marriage falls through, Fong will still be )Tj
T*(bound to marry Mei Li. )Tj
T*( Ta's blind date proves to be the thoroughly Americanized Linda Low, who we )Tj
T*(will learn is Sammy Fong's girlfriend and a stripper at his club. On the date )Tj
T*(with Ta \("I Enjoy Being a Girl"\), Linda lies to Ta about her career and family. )Tj
T*(Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees find it hard to get a )Tj
T*(job befitting their education, plans to go to law school, postponing the likely )Tj
T*(career struggle by three years. The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. She )Tj
T*(agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother )Tj
T*(who will approve the marriage. Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is )Tj
T*(immediately attracted to him \("I Am Going to Like It Here"\), though Ta is )Tj
T*(unimpressed. That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress \("Like a God"\). )Tj
T*( Linda comes to Madam Liang's graduation party from citizenship school with )Tj
T*(Linda's "brother" \(actually the comedian from Sammy's nightclub\) and presents )Tj
T*(herself as Ta's intended, with her "brother" giving his consent for the )Tj
T*(marriage. The extroverted, Americanized woman is not what Wang has in mind for )Tj
T*(his elder son, and Wang and Ta argue. Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates )Tj
T*(Linda's scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, )Tj
T*(is determined to marry someone, and if Sammy won't step forward, she will )Tj
T*(settle for Ta. Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her )Tj
T*(father to watch the show at his "Celestial Bar" \("Fan Tan Fannie"\). Linda does )Tj
T*(her striptease, realizing too late who is sitting at the best table. Sammy's )Tj
T*(special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated that he does not )Tj
T*(know what to do. He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress )Tj
T*(who fits Linda's costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited. Linda, )Tj
T*(goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises his glass to her, dumps a champagne )Tj
T*(bucket over his head. )Tj
T*( Act II: The drunken Ta spends the night at Helen's apartment \("Ballet"\). In )Tj
T*(the morning, Mei Li delivers Master Wang's coat for Helen to mend and is )Tj
T*(distressed to see Ta's dinner jacket there. Mei Li jumps to conclusions and )Tj
T*(leaves horrified. Ta leaves the lonely Helen, totally oblivious to her attempts )Tj
T*(to interest him. Wang wants the bar and its "evil spirits" shut down; his )Tj
T*(sister-in-law informs him that free enterprise cannot be shut down, and the two )Tj
T*(wonder at the foibles of the younger generation \("The Other Generation"\). Ta )Tj
T*(arrives home to admit that his father was right, Mei Li is the girl for him. )Tj

T*( Ta brings Mei Li a wedding gift of a pair of his mother's earrings that she )Tj

T*(goblet to his new bride. Unveiled, Mei Li confesses to Sammy's mother that she )Tj

T*(and Ta the opportunity to marry their true loves, Linda and Mei Li. )Tj
T*( [edit] Casting and tryouts )Tj
T*( According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Rodgers, Hammerstein and )Tj
T*(Fields had hoped to engage Yul Brynner as director. Brynner, who had gained )Tj
T*(fame in the team's 1951 hit, The King and I, was an accomplished director. )Tj
T*(However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not )Tj
T*(negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. Instead, they hired actor and )Tj
T*(dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before. Kelly felt that the )Tj
T*(work would not be one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best, but "as long as I )Tj
T*(crammed the show brim-full of every joke and gimmick in the book, I could get )Tj
T*(it to work".[18] )Tj
T*( The three producers sought Chinese, or at least Asian, actors to fill the )Tj
T*(cast, an idea that was, at the time, considered "very risky".[14] In the 1950s, )Tj
T*(there were relatively few Asian-American actors;[19] Rodgers believed that )Tj
T*(Asians avoided acting because of shyness.[20] Critics note, in any case, that )Tj
T*(Asian-Americans "had found few opportunities in mainstream theatre."[14]Joshua )Tj
T*(Logan recommended a young Japanese actress, Miyoshi Umeki, whom he had )Tj
T*(discovered and cast the previous year opposite Marlon Brando in the film )Tj
T*(Sayonara \(for which she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar\); she was cast as )Tj
T*(Mei Li.[19] They cast Keye Luke, well known as Charlie Chan's Number One Son, )Tj
T*(as Master Wang.[21] Rodgers and Hammerstein considered young talent from The )Tj
T*(King and I who might fit the parts, and came up with teenager Patrick Adiarte, )Tj
T*(a Filipino-American who had played several of the young princes as he grew up, )Tj
T*(before finishing as the crown prince, Chulalongkorn. A talented dancer, he was )Tj
T*(cast as Wang San, Ta's thoroughly Americanized younger brother.[22]Pat Suzuki, )Tj
T*(a Japanese-American who had been interned during World War II, was a recent )Tj
T*(arrival in New York who had made strong positive impressions for her singing on )Tj
T*(such television programs as The Tonight Show \(with Jack Paar\) and The Ed )Tj
T*(Sullivan Show. She became the first Linda Low, as Ta's nightclub love interest )Tj
T*(was renamed.[23] )Tj
T*( The team found it difficult to fill the remaining places in the company with )Tj
T*(Asian performers, especially in the chorus. Four other shows with Asian themes )Tj
T*(had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian )Tj
T*(actors was strong.[24] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, )Tj
T*(journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. Agents were sent to )Tj
T*(other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and Native Hawaiian Ed )Tj
T*(Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. Meanwhile, in New York, the three )Tj
T*(producers were visiting dance schools. An advertisement in New York Chinatown )Tj
T*(newspapers received one response. No formal audition was held in San )Tj
T*(Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian )Tj
T*(Goro "Jack" Suzuki \(who soon changed his name to Jack Soo\), who was cast as )Tj
T*(Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar.[25] The role of Fong )Tj
T*(proved difficult to cast. Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub )Tj
T*(comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry )Tj
T*(Blyden,[21] who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer.[26] The )Tj
T*(role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a )Tj

T*(South Pacific.[27] Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was )Tj
T*(considered for the cast but not hired.[28] Rodgers later wrote, "what was )Tj
T*(important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. This )Tj
T*(demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. People )Tj
T*(want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with )Tj
T*(whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza )Tj
T*(as a Frenchman [in South Pacific], Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared )Tj
T*(to meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up."[29] )Tj
T*( When rehearsals began in September 1958, Hammerstein was absent, still )Tj
T*(recuperating from his surgery. Rodgers was present, but kept falling )Tj
T*(asleep.[20] Hammerstein was told by his son James that Kelly was ineffective as )Tj
T*(a director, and began attending rehearsals.[30] A number of changes were made )Tj
T*(to the songs. "My Best Love", a song for Master Wang, was at first thought )Tj
T*(better suited to his sister-in-law, but when Juanita Hall could not make it )Tj
T*(work, the song was cut entirely. Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed a song )Tj
T*(entitled "She Is Beautiful" into "You Are Beautiful". The team decided to )Tj
T*(include a song for Sammy Fong to explain to Mei Li that they should not wed. In )Tj
T*(the span of a few hours, they wrote the lyrics and music to "Don't Marry )Tj
T*(Me".[21] Once the songs were finalized, Robert Russell Bennett, who had )Tj
T*(orchestrated several of the creators' most successful previous shows, did the )Tj
T*(same for the score of Flower Drum Song.[31] )Tj
T*( The musical opened for tryouts on October 27, 1958 at Boston's Shubert )Tj
T*(Theatre. The audience gave it an enthusiastic response, causing Rodgers to )Tj
T*(leave his seat repeatedly and race to the back of the theatre, looking for )Tj
T*(someone to hug. The Boston critics thought well of the work, stating that after )Tj
T*(the show was polished, it was likely to be a hit.[32] Shortly after the Boston )Tj
T*(opening, Fields suffered a heart attack, and, after his release from the )Tj
T*(hospital, he had to return to New York to recuperate. Author C. Y. Lee, who had )Tj
T*(quietly watched the rehearsals, recalled that, at the Boston performances, )Tj
T*(Hammerstein would have a secretary mark on the script any sound of the chairs )Tj
T*(squeaking, as indicating that the audience was restless. Hammerstein rewrote )Tj
T*(some of the book to expand the focus from Ta himself to the romantic )Tj
T*(relationships of the two couples.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Productions )Tj
T*( [edit] Original Broadway production )Tj
T*( After the Boston tryouts, Flower Drum Song opened on Broadway at the St. James )Tj
T*(Theatre on December 1, 1958. Sets were designed by Oliver Smith, costumes by )Tj
T*(Irene Sharaff and lighting by Peggy Clark.[31] )Tj
T*( C.Y. Lee sat in the audience on the first night; he later stated that he had )Tj
T*(been nervous and was "bowled over" by the positive audience reaction.[2] The )Tj
T*(show attracted considerable advance sales; even when these were exhausted, )Tj
T*(sales remained strong and sellouts were the norm. Cast album sales were similar )Tj
T*(to previous Rodgers and Hammerstein hits.[34] The show received six Tony Award )Tj
T*(nominations, but won only one Tony \(Best Conductor and Musical Director, for )Tj
T*(Salvatore Dell'Isola\). It was overshadowed that year by Redhead, which though )Tj
T*(it received only slightly better reviews than Flower Drum Song, and had a )Tj
T*(considerably shorter run, dominated the Tony Awards in the musical )Tj
T*(categories.[35]Flower Drum Song ran for 600Â performances, a longer run than any )Tj
T*(other musical from the 1958â€“1959 season â€“ it lasted longer than any of the )Tj
T*(shows with which it had competed for Asian performers.[36] )Tj
T*( Midway through the run, Larry Blyden left the show and was replaced in the )Tj
T*(role of Sammy Fong by Jack Soo, with Larry Leung assuming the role of Frankie )Tj
T*(Wing.[36] The production returned $125,000Â profit to its backers on an )Tj
T*(investment of $360,000. Attendance began to decline in December 1959, though it )Tj
T*(continued to draw at above the 70% of capacity level which a Broadway play then )Tj
T*(needed to meet expenses. With the summer approaching, generally a bad time for )Tj
T*(attendance, it was decided to close the show, and the last Broadway performance )Tj
T*(was given on May 7, 1960.[37] )Tj

T*( [edit] Subsequent productions )Tj
T*( The show opened in London's Palace Theatre on March 24, 1960 and ran for 464 )Tj
T*(performances.[38] Fewer Asian performers were used in London; the West End )Tj
T*(production starred Yau Shan Tung as Mei Li, Kevin Scott as Ta, George Minami as )Tj
T*(Wang, Yama Saki as Linda Low, Tim Herbert as Sammy Fong and Ida Shepley as )Tj
T*(Madam Liang.[31] The production used Haney's choreography, Bennett's )Tj
T*(orchestrations and the Broadway set and costume designs, but was directed and )Tj
T*(supervised by Jerome Whyte.[39] Both the production and the London cast album )Tj
T*(were well received.[40][41] )Tj
T*( Following the closure of the Broadway production, a U.S. national tour began )Tj
T*(on May 10, 1960 in Detroit. Four of the New York leads, Hall, Soo, Kenney and )Tj
T*(Luke, joined the tour. By this time, Hammerstein was in his final illness \(he )Tj
T*(died in August 1960\), and none of the three producers accompanied the show on )Tj
T*(the road.[42] After three weeks in Detroit, the show moved to Los Angeles, )Tj
T*(where the premiere attracted a star-studded audience, including three )Tj
T*(Scandinavian princesses.[43] San Francisco gave the show a rapturous reception )Tj
T*(when it opened at the Curran Theatre on August 1. Lee and Fields, both present )Tj
T*(for the local premiere, were given ovations.[44]Geary Street, on which the )Tj
T*(theatre is located, was decorated with Chinese lanterns, and a marching band of )Tj
T*("Chinese girl musicians" played outside.[45] The tour continued to be )Tj
T*(successful, spending 21Â weeks in Chicago alone. It closed on October 14, 1961 )Tj
T*(in Cleveland, a month before the film of the musical opened.[31][46] )Tj
T*( Lewis calls the 1961 film version of Flower Drum Song, starring Umeki, Soo, )Tj
T*(Hall and Suzie Wong star Nancy Kwan, "a bizarre pastiche of limping )Tj
T*(mediocrity". He comments that since the 1958 version of the musical was rarely )Tj
T*(revived, the film "would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it )Tj
T*(so crassly misrepresented"[47] and would serve as the version that academics )Tj
T*(and latter-day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical. The )Tj
T*(film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to )Tj
T*(lose money.[48] Nevertheless, it was nominated for five Academy Awards and )Tj
T*(featured choreography by Hermes Pan.[31] As early as mid-1961, the musical was )Tj
T*(licensed for local productions. That summer, the San Diego Civic Light Opera )Tj
T*(filled the 4,324-seat Balboa Park Bowl to overflowing for a highly successful )Tj
T*(run of the musical.[49] It was less successfully revived by that company five )Tj
T*(years later; though it still attracted large crowds, local critics complained )Tj
T*(that Hammerstein's view of Asians was outdated.[50] Other early productions )Tj
T*(included successful revivals by the St. Louis Municipal Opera in 1961 and )Tj
T*(1965[51] and revivals in the San Francisco area in 1963 and 1964, both times )Tj
T*(with Soo as Sammy Fong.[52] )Tj
T*( The musical proved difficult to produce for amateur and school groups, )Tj
T*(however, because it requires a cast either Asian or made up as Asian. Even )Tj
T*(professional companies found it difficult to round up an entire cast of Asian )Tj
T*(singer-dancer-actors.[14] By the late 1960s, the musical was rarely staged,[31] )Tj
T*(and was often relegated to dinner theater productions.[53] The Rodgers &amp; )Tj
T*(Hammerstein Organization, which licenses the partnership's works, believes that )Tj
T*(the work's loss of popularity was due in part to increased racial sensitivity )Tj
T*(in the U. S. after the civil rights movement.[2] In addition, producers found )Tj
T*(the show to be thinly plotted, and the songs not integrated as organically with )Tj
T*(the characters and story, as compared with Rodgers and Hammerstein's most )Tj
T*(popular musicals.[14] )Tj
T*( Flower Drum Song came to be seen by some as stereotypical and patronizing )Tj
T*(towards Asians, and that it was "inauthentic, even offensive in its )Tj
T*(relentlessly upbeat picture of a big-city Chinatown".[14] In 1983, the )Tj

T*(producers pointedly stated that the show would be set in the 1930s and would )Tj
T*(have "a greater sensitivity toward the Chinese immigration problems at that )Tj
T*(time".[54] They added a scene in which Mei Li listens apprehensively to a radio )Tj
T*(broadcast warning about the dangers to the United States caused by Asian )Tj
T*(immigration. Many lines of dialogue were cut, and producer Fred Van Patten )Tj
T*(stated that "[w]hat we've done is cut things in the show that Asians said to )Tj
T*(make white people laugh."[55] The song "Chop Suey" was deleted, as was Master )Tj
T*(Wang's line that all white men look alike \(based on a line in C. Y. Lee's )Tj
T*(novel, in which Wang states that all foreigners look alike\).[56] The author )Tj
T*(gave a rare public interview to defend his novel and suggest that by doing such )Tj
T*(things as eliminating pigtails from the production, the producers were )Tj
T*(attempting to rewrite history. The show, which had been scheduled for a )Tj
T*(three-week run, closed early.[57] A well-attended production in Oakland in 1993 )Tj
T*(adhered strictly to the 1958 script, though part of the ballet was cut for lack )Tj
T*(of rehearsal time;[58] a more heavily censored 1996 production in San Mateo )Tj
T*(also did well at the box office.[59] )Tj
T*( [edit] 2002 revival )Tj
T*( In 1996, while attending the successful revival of The King and I, )Tj
T*(Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers )Tj
T*(and Hammerstein shows could be revived and decided to work on Flower Drum Song. )Tj
T*(To Chinese Americans, the musical "represented political incorrectness )Tj
T*(incarnate. But [Hwang] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It was )Tj
T*(kind of a guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you )Tj
T*(could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and )Tj
T*(cracking jokes.'"[14] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein )Tj
T*(Organization, announced that an unnamed "Asian playwright" had approached him )Tj
T*(about revising Flower Drum Song.[60] Chapin called the musical "a naive, old )Tj
T*(fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.Â ... It's one that ... )Tj
T*(needs changes."[60] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he )Tj
T*(would have agreed to \(Hammerstein's instructions are unknown\), but during her )Tj
T*(lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the )Tj
T*(plays.[61] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee )Tj
T*(announced that the rewrite had his approval.[62] )Tj
T*( Hwang was given a free hand with dialogue; he was not allowed to change )Tj
T*(lyrics.[63] Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals, and the producers )Tj
T*(hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the )Tj
T*(new script, "really a new musical which has a pre-existing score."[14] Only the )Tj
T*(character names, the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the )Tj
T*(relationships were retained, but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit )Tj
T*(of both Lee's novel and the musical's original concept of old-world and older )Tj
T*(generation values struggling with new-world temptations and the desires of the )Tj
T*(younger generation. This concept is reflected in the struggle for survival of )Tj

T*(a "savvy career woman" in show business.[14] Chinatown is portrayed as a more )Tj

T*(success is given a more cynical face, especially in Act II.[14] The song "The )Tj

T*(Mark Taper Forum. Producer Gordon Davidson engaged an all-Asian cast, including )Tj
T*(Broadway star Lea Salonga as Mei-li.[67] When it finally opened on October 14, )Tj
T*(2001,[68] the production received rave reviews from the Los Angeles )Tj
T*(critics.[69] The show regularly sold out and was so popular it became the first )Tj
T*(show at the Taper to extend its scheduled run. It finally closed on January 13, )Tj
T*(2002.[70] )Tj
T*( The success of the Los Angeles run sparked sufficient investment to move the )Tj
T*(show to Broadway.[71] Half the cast was dismissed after the Los Angeles run for )Tj
T*(unstated reasons. Mary Rodgers later commented that Randall Duk Kim replaced )Tj
T*(Tzi Ma as Wang because she had admired Kim's performance as the Kralahome in )Tj
T*(the 1996 revival of The King and I, but Kim was unavailable for the Los Angeles )Tj
T*(run.[72] Hwang considerably altered and trimmed his long script during Broadway )Tj
T*(rehearsals and previews; "The Next Time It Happens" was removed from the show. )Tj
T*(During the runup to the Broadway opening, the show received mostly positive )Tj
T*(publicity.[73] )Tj
T*( Opening night at the Virginia Theatre on October 17, 2002 was attended by )Tj
T*(veterans of the film and 1958 production. Though it received warm applause from )Tj
T*(the audience, the critics mostly panned it.[74] Attendance was near-capacity )Tj
T*(during the first month of the run, but then dropped off precipitously. The )Tj
T*(producers hoped the show could hold out long enough to get a boost from the )Tj
T*(Tony Awards[75] \(though nominated for three, including best book, it won )Tj
T*(none\),[76] but in February, they announced that the show would close on March )Tj
T*(16, 2003, after 169Â performances. The show's backers lost their entire )Tj
T*(investment.[75] )Tj
T*( The production was directed and choreographed by Longbottom, with scenic )Tj
T*(design by Robin Wagner, costume design by Gregg Barnes and lighting design by )Tj
T*(Natasha Katz.[77] Critic Karen Wada, in her afterword to the published script, )Tj
T*(blamed "the sluggish economy, post-September 11 jitters, the New York Times' )Tj
T*(mixed review, and unusually bitter winter weather" for the unexpectedly short )Tj
T*(run.[78] Lee also felt that the influential Times review had hurt the show's )Tj
T*(acceptance, but commented that Hwang added some dialogue to Act II after the )Tj
T*(Los Angeles run that Lee felt slowed the show down.[1] The closing was followed )Tj
T*(by a national tour that garnered mixed reviews, although Hwang stated that it )Tj
T*(was well received in every city except New York.[79] )Tj
T*( Subsequent productions have favored the Hwang script, although the older )Tj
T*(version remains available for license[80] and has received occasional revivals, )Tj
T*(including a 2006 staged concert as part of Ian Marshall Fisher's Lost Musicals )Tj
T*(series. A review in London's The Times compared this production with "the much )Tj
T*(grander production of Show Boat currently docked at the Albert Hall" and judged )Tj
T*(that "Flower Drum Song makes the more stimulating experience."[81] )Tj
T*( [edit] 2002 plot )Tj
T*( Prologue: In 1960, Wu Mei-li, a performer in Chinese opera, flees China with a )Tj

T*(Hundred Million Miracles"\). )Tj
T*( Act I: On arrival in the United States, Mei-li goes to the Golden Pearl )Tj
T*(Theatre in San Francisco's Chinatown, where little-attended Chinese opera is )Tj
T*(presented by her father's old friend Wang Chi-yang and Wang's foster brother )Tj
T*(Chin. One night a week, Wang's son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub, )Tj
T*(starring the very assimilated Linda Low, a Chinese-American stripper from )Tj
T*(Seattle. Linda's constant companion is a gay costume designer, Harvard \(so )Tj
T*(named by his success-obsessed Chinese parents\). The nightclub is profitable; )Tj
T*(the Chinese opera is not. Mei-li joins the opera company \("I Am Going to Like )Tj

T*(is fascinated by Linda, who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle \("I Enjoy )Tj

T*(crowd ever came to his theater expecting to enjoy themselves. Outraged at )Tj
T*(Harvard's poor acting skills, Wang takes the stage in his place, his stage )Tj

T*(Chop Suey. )Tj
T*( Act II: Several months pass, and Club Chop Suey has become even flashier )Tj
T*(\("Chop Suey"\). Ta can not forget Mei-li, and his uncle Chin \(a janitor under )Tj

T*( [edit] Critical reception )Tj
T*( [edit] Original productions )Tj
T*( Of the seven major New York newspaper drama reviewers, five gave the show very )Tj
T*(positive reviews. For example, New York Journal American critic John McClain )Tj
T*(stated, "Flower Drum Song is a big fat Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, and nothing )Tj
T*(written here will have the slightest effect on the proceeds."[83] The New York )Tj
T*(Daily Mirror termed it, "Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of )Tj
T*(our musical theatreÂ ... a lovely show, an outstanding one in theme and )Tj
T*(treatment."[84] Less enthusiastic, however, was the longtime New York Times )Tj
T*(critic, Brooks Atkinson, who repeatedly described it as merely "pleasant".[83] )Tj
T*(UPI's drama critic, Jack Gaver, scored it as "well north of Me and Juliet and )Tj
T*(Pipe Dream" but "well south" of Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific and even the )Tj
T*(team's first flop, Allegro.[85]Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having "a )Tj
T*(brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman" and termed the )Tj
T*(production "an excellent Broadway show" though "[p]erhaps it doesn't belong in )Tj
T*(the same worldÂ ... as The King and I and Carousel."[86] Critic Kenneth Tynan, )Tj
T*(in The New Yorker magazine, alluded to the show The World of Suzie Wong in )Tj
T*(dismissing Flower Drum Song with the spoonerism, "a world of woozy song".[87] )Tj
T*( When the national tour of the show visited the city of its setting, most San )Tj
T*(Francisco reviewers gave the show very positive reviews, though the Oakland )Tj
T*(Tribune critic described the musical as one "which has little by way of witty )Tj
T*(dialogue, outstanding songs or vigorous choreography". Nevertheless, she called )Tj
T*(the touring production superior to the Broadway one.[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] 2002 revival )Tj
T*( Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times called the show "wholly revised and )Tj
T*(gleefully self-awareÂ ... a few tons short of a mega-musical â€“ no fake )Tj
T*(helicopters here, no power ballads saccharine enough to stop Communism in its )Tj
T*(tracks."[69] The Hollywood Reporter thought the revival was, "while not )Tj
T*(perfect, an exhilarating accomplishment".[69]Variety called it "a bold )Tj
T*(theatrical operation, an artistic success".[69] )Tj

T*(reviews.[88]Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team's )Tj
T*("honorable intentions" in bringing back a work thought to be "terminally )Tj
T*(out-of-date", but felt both the new Mei-li and the show around her lacked )Tj
T*(personality.[65] Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it "an )Tj
T*(entertaining, albeit vulgar revival", and Clive Barnes of the New York Post )Tj
T*(found it no more memorable than the earlier version.[88] The review in Talkin' )Tj
T*(Broadway is scathing, criticizing Hwang's use of the songs and characters, and )Tj
T*(the orchestrations, and commenting: "Hwang's book lacks much of the charm, )Tj
T*(warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low )Tj
T*(road will do. ... Hwang felt it necessary to reduce the original, uniquely )Tj
T*(colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame )Tj
T*(jokes."[89] Michael Kuchwara commented about Harvard in his lukewarm review for )Tj
T*(Associated Press: "Then there's Linda Low's gay confidante, Harvard. Talk about )Tj
T*(stereotypes. If you are going to perpetuate one at least give him better )Tj
T*(jokes."[88] On the other hand, both USA Today and Time magazine gave it )Tj
T*(positive reviews. The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that )Tj
T*(Hwang and Longbottom "were able to keep numbers like 'Chop Suey' and milk it )Tj
T*(for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a )Tj
T*(springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians."[90] Brantley disagreed, )Tj
T*(writing, "because the show's satiric point of view is so muddled, there's no )Tj
T*(verve in such numbers, no joy in the performing of them."[65] )Tj
T*( In 2006, David Lewis compared the original script to Hwang's version: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(History never completely goes away. Hwang's champions are unlikely to fade )Tj
T*(away, either, in rhetorical defeat. Dick and Oscar and Joe mined C. Y. Lee's )Tj
T*(novel for the generational conflict and for the three women who substantiated )Tj
T*(Ta's honorable search for love. Those themes, like it or not, still resonate )Tj
T*(today.[91])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Music and recordings )Tj
T*( Rodgers and Hammerstein sought to give the new work an Eastern flavor, without )Tj
T*(using existing oriental music.[92] According to Ben Brantley in his review of )Tj
T*(the 2002 Broadway revival, the use by Rodgers "of repetitive Eastern musical )Tj
T*(structures gives the numbers a sing-song catchiness that, for better or worse, )Tj
T*(exerts a sticky hold on the memory."[65] The most oriental-sounding song in the )Tj
T*(work is "A Hundred Million Miracles", which provides the eight-note drumbeat )Tj
T*(which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain.[93] )Tj
T*(Hammerstein wrote Mei Li's first act song, "I Am Going to Like It Here", in a )Tj
T*(Malaysian poetic form called pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of )Tj
T*(each stanza become the first and third lines of the next.[29][92] One critic )Tj
T*(thought that the 2001 version's orchestrations "boast more Asian accents and a )Tj
T*(jazzier edge than the original",[14] but another felt that they "pale in )Tj
T*(comparison" to Bennett's typically lilting sound.[89] )Tj
T*( As with many of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musicals, the work features a ballet )Tj
T*(at the start of the second act, choreographed in the original production by )Tj
T*(Carol Haney.[94] The ballet dramatizes the confused romantic longings of Wang )Tj
T*(Ta towards the women in his life, and ends as he awakens in Helen Chao's )Tj
T*(bed.[95] Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, notes )Tj
T*(that the ballets in Oklahoma! and Carousel \(choreographed by Agnes de Mille\) )Tj
T*(broke new ground in illustrating facets of the characters beyond what is )Tj
T*(learned in songs and dialogue, but describes the ballet in Flower Drum Song as )Tj
T*("pleasant but not memorable".[94] Although Hischak describes Rodgers as "the )Tj
T*(greatest waltz composer America has ever seen",[96]Flower Drum Song was the )Tj
T*(first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical not to feature one.[92] )Tj
T*( Several of the characters are given "I am" songs that introduce them to the )Tj
T*(audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for )Tj
T*(onlookers to establish empathy with the character. Linda Low, for example, )Tj
T*(expresses her self-confidence with "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's )Tj
T*(hopes with the quieter "I Am Going to Like It Here".[97] Although not a formal )Tj
T*(musical number, the brief "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced )Tj

T*(by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by )Tj
T*(Lewis as "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" )Tj
T*(in a Broadway musical.[98] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang )Tj
T*(San, however, saw it as "corny stuffÂ ... put in there to get a laugh".[98] )Tj
T*(Helen Chao's sad "Love, Look Away" is described by Lewis as "arguably the most )Tj
T*(tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".[92] )Tj
T*( Having decided that record companies were profiting more from the sales of )Tj
T*(their cast albums than they were, Rodgers and Hammerstein formed their own )Tj
T*(record company to produce the cast recording for the original production of )Tj
T*(Flower Drum Song. The album sold a relatively modest 300,000Â copies, compared )Tj
T*(with sales of over a million copies for Rodgers and Hammerstein's next and )Tj
T*(final musical, The Sound of Music.[99] Still, it was certified as a gold record )Tj
T*(for having at least a million dollars in sales,[100] and it spent 67 weeks in )Tj
T*(the U.S. Top 40, three of them at numberÂ 1, and also did well in the UK when )Tj
T*(the show opened there in 1960.[101] The original cast album is relatively )Tj
T*(complete, even including parts of the Wedding Parade, though it does not )Tj
T*(include the ballet.[31] )Tj
T*( In 1960, the London cast recording was released. According to Hischak, the )Tj
T*(individual performers do not sing as well as the New York cast; the London )Tj
T*(recording's strong points are the nightclub numbers. The 1961 album from the )Tj
T*(film uses a larger orchestra and, according to Hischak, has a fuller sound than )Tj
T*(the Broadway recording. It features dubbing by the opera singer Marilyn Horne )Tj
T*(\("Love, Look Away"\) and band singer B. J. Baker \(for Linda Low's songs\). A cast )Tj
T*(album for Hwang's revision was released in 2002 featuring strong performances )Tj
T*(from Lea Salonga as Mei-li and Jose Llana as Wang Ta. This was nominated for a )Tj
T*(Grammy,[3][102] though it did not win.[103] Hischak notes that it is unfair to )Tj

T*( The Greater Crested Tern[2] \(Thalasseus bergii\), also called Crested Tern or )Tj
T*(Swift Tern, is a seabird in the tern family which nests in dense colonies on )Tj
T*(coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical Old World. Its five )Tj
T*(subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the )Tj
T*(central Pacific and Australia, all populations dispersing widely from the )Tj
T*(breeding range after nesting. This large tern is closely related to the Royal )Tj
T*(and Lesser Crested Terns, but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour. )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern has grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow bill, )Tj
T*(and a shaggy black crest which recedes in winter. Its young have a distinctive )Tj
T*(appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, and rely on )Tj
T*(their parents for food for several months after they have fledged. Like all )Tj
T*(members of the genus Thalasseus, the Greater Crested Tern feeds by plunge )Tj
T*(diving for fish, usually in marine environments; the male offers fish to the )Tj
T*(female as part of the courtship ritual. )Tj
T*( This is an adaptable species which has learned to follow fishing boats for )Tj
T*(jettisoned bycatch, and to utilise unusual nest sites such as the roofs of )Tj
T*(buildings and artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works. Its eggs and )Tj
T*(young are taken by gulls and ibises, and human activities such as fishing, )Tj
T*(shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines. There are no )Tj
T*(global conservation concerns for this bird, which has a stable total population )Tj
T*(of more than 500,000 individuals. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely )Tj
T*(related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but )Tj
T*(typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings \(which give them a fast, )Tj
T*(buoyant flight\), a deeply forked tail and short legs. Most species are grey )Tj
T*(above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with )Tj
T*(white in the winter.[3] )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern was originally described as Sterna bergii by German )Tj
T*(naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, but was moved to its current genus, )Tj

T*( The northern subspecies T. b. velox and T. b. thalassina are in breeding )Tj
T*(plumage from May to September or October, whereas the relevant period for the )Tj
T*(two southern African races is from December to April. For T. b. cristata, the )Tj
T*(moult timing depends on location; birds from Australia and Oceania are in )Tj
T*(breeding plumage from September to about April, but those in Thailand, China )Tj
T*(and Sulawesi have this appearance from February to June or July.[12] )Tj
T*( The Royal Tern is similar in size to this species, but has a heavier build, )Tj
T*(broader wings, a paler back and a blunter, more orange bill. The Greater )Tj
T*(Crested often associates with the Lesser Crested Tern, but is 25%Â larger than )Tj
T*(the latter, with a proportionately longer bill, longer and heavier head, and )Tj
T*(bulkier body.[15] Lesser Crested Tern has an orange-tinted bill, and in )Tj
T*(immature plumage it is much less variegated than Greater Crested.[11] )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern is highly vocal, especially at its breeding grounds. )Tj
T*(The territorial advertising call is a loud, raucous, crow-like kerrak. Other )Tj
T*(calls include a korrkorrkorr given at the nest by anxious or excited birds, and )Tj
T*(a hard wep wep in flight.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and habitat )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts )Tj
T*(of the Old World from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and )Tj
T*(Australia. The subspecies T. b. bergii and T. b. enigma breed in Southern )Tj
T*(Africa from Namibia to Tanzania, and possibly on islands around Madagascar. )Tj
T*(There is then a break in the breeding distribution of this species until )Tj
T*(Somalia and the Red Sea, and another discontinuity further east in southern )Tj
T*(India.[9] )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including )Tj
T*(Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles, the Chagos Archipelago, and )Tj
T*(Rodrigues.[16] There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands, including )Tj
T*(Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, the Society Islands and the Tuamotus.[17] )Tj
T*( The nests are located on lowâ€‘lying sandy, rocky, or coral islands, sometimes )Tj
T*(amongst stunted shrubs, often without any shelter at all.[15] When not )Tj
T*(breeding, the Greater Crested Tern will roost or rest on open shores, less )Tj
T*(often on boats, pilings, harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons. )Tj
T*(It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters.[13] )Tj
T*( All populations of Greater Crested Tern disperse after breeding. When Southern )Tj
T*(African birds leave colonies in Namibia and Western Cape Province, most adults )Tj
T*(move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa. Many young birds also )Tj
T*(travel east, sometimes more than 2,000Â km \(1,200Â mi\), but others move )Tj
T*(northwards along the western coast. T. b. thalassina winters on the east )Tj
T*(African coast north to Kenya and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban. )Tj
T*(Populations of T. b. velox breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to )Tj
T*(be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly migratory, but those breeding in )Tj
T*(the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya.[13]T. b. )Tj
T*(cristata mostly stays within 400Â km \(260Â mi\) of its colonies, but some birds )Tj
T*(wander up to around 1,000Â km \(600Â mi\).[18] This species has occurred as a )Tj
T*(vagrant to Hawaii,[19]New Zealand,[20][21]North Korea,[20]Jordan,[20] and )Tj
T*(Israel.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Behaviour )Tj
T*( [edit] Breeding )Tj
T*( The Greater Crested Tern breeds in colonies, often in association with other )Tj
T*(seabirds. It is monogamous and the pair bond is maintained through the year and )Tj
T*(sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons.[22] The colony size is related to )Tj
T*(the abundance of pelagic fish prey,[13] and the largest documented colony, with )Tj
T*(13,000 to 15,000 pairs, is in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia, a )Tj
T*(region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds. Since nesting in )Tj
T*(this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding, it is presumably a response to )Tj
T*(fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to )Tj
T*(the Gulf.[23] This tern does not show site fidelity, frequently changing its )Tj
T*(nest site from year to year,[15] sometimes by more than 200Â km \(130Â mi\).[18] )Tj

T*(territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is )Tj
T*(normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area )Tj
T*(reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex )Tj
T*(and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this )Tj
T*(behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between )Tj
T*(the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies )Tj
T*(around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also )Tj
T*(fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.[24] )Tj
T*( The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping )Tj
T*(ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones. )Tj
T*(One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30Â )Tj
T*(days prior to hatching.[13] The eggs are cream with blackish streaks.[25] Egg )Tj
T*(laying is synchronised within a breeding colony[26] and more tightly so within )Tj
T*(sub-colonies.[27] Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched )Tj
T*(chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two )Tj
T*(days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest.[28] The precocial )Tj
T*(chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both )Tj
T*(parents, but may gather in crÃ¨ches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 )Tj
T*(to 40Â days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until )Tj
T*(they are about four months old.[13] )Tj
T*( In South Africa, this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of )Tj
T*(building, sometimes with Hartlaub's Gull, which also shares the more typical )Tj
T*(nesting sites of the nominate race. In 2000, 7.5%Â of the population of this )Tj
T*(subspecies bred on roofs.[29] Artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works )Tj
T*(have also recently been colonised by this adaptable seabird.[9] )Tj
T*( Adult terns have few predators, but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed )Tj
T*(of their food by Kelp Gulls, and that species, along with Hartlaub's Gull, )Tj
T*(Silver Gull and Sacred Ibis, has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings, )Tj
T*(especially when colonies are disturbed.[9][30] Smaller subcolonies with a )Tj
T*(relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more )Tj
T*(predation.[27] In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths )Tj
T*(by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been )Tj
T*(documented.[8] )Tj
T*( Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the )Tj
T*(Greater Crested Tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler )Tj
T*(discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern )Tj
T*(Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large )Tj
T*(prawn trawl fishery.[31] Conversely, purse-seine fishing reduces the available )Tj
T*(food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of Great Crested Terns )Tj
T*(breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to )Tj
T*(changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by )Tj
T*(purse-seine fishing.[30] Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with )Tj
T*(trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by longline )Tj
T*(fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that )Tj
T*(overall numbers are significantly affected.[13] )Tj
T*( An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island, )Tj
T*(South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, kelp )Tj
T*(mucilage and phytoplankton. After treatment, 90%Â of the birds were fit to be )Tj
T*(released.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Feeding )Tj
T*( Fish are the main food of the Greater Crested Tern, found to make up nearly )Tj
T*(90% of all prey items with the remainder including cephalopods, crustaceans and )Tj
T*(insects.[13] Unusual vertebrate prey included agamid lizards and green turtle )Tj
T*(hatchlings.[31] )Tj
T*( The Great Crested Tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up )Tj

T*(Mahalâ€”are tombs or objects found in and around them. In most instances, )Tj
T*(specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the )Tj
T*(burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, )Tj
T*(usually from their possessions. )Tj
T*( An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the )Tj
T*(division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public )Tj
T*(after completion of the funeral ceremonies.[3] The Tutankhamun treasure, for )Tj
T*(example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after )Tj
T*(it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly )Tj
T*(effective demonstration of the power of their creators. A similar division can )Tj
T*(be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art )Tj
T*(connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for )Tj
T*(later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians. In )Tj
T*(these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted sarcophagus and tomb monument )Tj
T*(of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. )Tj
T*(The mausoleum intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the )Tj
T*(classical world, and later common in Islamic culture. )Tj
T*( [edit] Common terms )Tj
T*( A tumulus, mound, kurgan, or long barrow covered important burials in many )Tj
T*(cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a )Tj
T*(coffin, usually of wood. A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, )Tj
T*(taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at Halicarnassus. Stele is a )Tj
T*(term for erect stones that are often what are now called gravestones. Ship )Tj
T*(burials are mostly found in coastal Europe, while chariot burials are found )Tj
T*(widely across Eurasia. Catacombs, of which the most famous examples are those )Tj
T*(in Rome and Alexandria, are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled )Tj
T*(passages. A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be )Tj
T*(called a necropolis; if there are no such visible structures, it is a grave )Tj
T*(field. A cenotaph is a memorial without a burial.[4] )Tj
T*( Related genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the )Tj
T*(moai figures of Easter Island, apparently a type of sculpted ancestor portrait, )Tj
T*(though hardly individualized.[5] These are common in cultures as diverse as )Tj
T*(Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the )Tj
T*(descendants, rather than being buried.[6] Many cultures have psychopomp )Tj
T*(figures, such as the Greek Hermes and Etruscan Charun, who help conduct the )Tj
T*(spirits of the dead into the afterlife. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Pre-history )Tj
T*( Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.[7] )Tj
T*(Mostly megalithic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of )Tj
T*(each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian )Tj
T*(peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510Â BCE, and some )Tj
T*(burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also date back to the fifth millennium )Tj
T*(BCE.[8] The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact )Tj
T*(that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from )Tj
T*(the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by )Tj
T*(encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch )Tj
T*(and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of )Tj
T*(collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of )Tj
T*(ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced )Tj
T*(to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and )Tj
T*(specialized sectors of activity.[9] )Tj
T*( In Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, a great variety of tombs are found, )Tj
T*(with tumulus mounds, megaliths, and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, )Tj
T*(a dolmen is the exposed stone framework for a chamber tomb originally covered )Tj
T*(by earth to make a mound which no longer exists. Stones may be carved with )Tj
T*(geometric patterns \(petroglyphs\), for example cup and ring marks. Group tombs )Tj
T*(were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. Urn burials, where )Tj
T*(bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by )Tj
T*(themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the Urnfield culture )Tj

T*(which is named after them, or even to Eurasia. Menhirs, or "standing stones", )Tj
T*(seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,[10] while the later runestones )Tj
T*(and image stones often are cenotaphs, or memorials apart from the grave itself; )Tj
T*(these continue into the Christian period. The Senegambian stone circles are a )Tj
T*(later African form of tomb markers.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ancient Egypt and Nubia )Tj
T*( Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the religious belief that )Tj
T*(life continued after death â€“ even more, it expressed a belief that "death is a )Tj
T*(mere phase of life".[12] Aesthetic objects and images connected with this )Tj
T*(belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status )Tj
T*(for the journey between this life and the next,[13] and to "commemorate the )Tj
T*(life of the tomb ownerÂ ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in )Tj
T*(general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's )Tj
T*(rebirth."[14] In this context, Egyptian mummies encased in one or more layers )Tj
T*(of decorated coffin, are famous; canopic jars preserved the internal organs. A )Tj
T*(special category of Ancient Egyptian funerary texts clarify the purposes of the )Tj
T*(burial customs. The early mastaba type of tomb had a sealed underground burial )Tj
T*(chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a )Tj
T*(pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A Ka statue effigy of the deceased )Tj
T*(might be walled up in a serdab connected to the offering chamber by vents that )Tj
T*(allowed the smell of incense to reach the effigy.[15] The walls of important )Tj
T*(tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with reliefs in )Tj
T*(stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of )Tj
T*(the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the )Tj
T*(afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a "false door", through )Tj
T*(which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to received the offerings left )Tj
T*(by the living.[16] )Tj
T*( Representational art, such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found )Tj
T*(extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the encaustic Faiyum )Tj
T*(funerary portraits applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated )Tj
T*(whether there was realistic portraiture in Ancient Egypt.[17] The purpose of )Tj
T*(the life-sized reserve heads found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the )Tj
T*(Fourth dynasty is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of )Tj
T*(eliding an edict by Khufu forbidding nobles from creating statues of )Tj
T*(themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically )Tj
T*(eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for )Tj
T*(the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.[18] )Tj
T*( Architectural works such as the massive Great Pyramid and two smaller ones )Tj
T*(built during the Old Kingdom in the Giza Necropolis and \(much later, from about )Tj
T*(1500Â BCE\) the tombs in the Valley of the Kings were built for royalty and the )Tj
T*(elite. The Theban Necropolis was later an important site for mortuary temples )Tj
T*(and mastaba tombs. The Kushite kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs )Tj
T*(during the Twenty-fifth dynasty were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary )Tj
T*(customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and ushabti funerary figurines. )Tj
T*(They also built the Nubian pyramids, which in both size and design more closely )Tj
T*(resemble the smaller Seventeenth dynasty pyramids at Thebes than those of the )Tj
T*(Old Kingdom near Memphis.[19] )Tj
T*( Lower-class citizens used common forms of funerary artâ€”including shabti )Tj
T*(figurines \(to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in )Tj
T*(the afterlife\), models of the scarab beetle and books of the deadâ€”which they )Tj
T*(believed would protect them in the afterlife.[20] During the Middle Kingdom, )Tj
T*(miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became )Tj
T*(popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the )Tj

T*(military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient )Tj
T*(Egyptian afterlife.[21] )Tj

T*(erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of kouros statues in )Tj
T*(the Archaic period before about 500Â BCE. These were not intended as portraits, )Tj
T*(but during the Hellenistic period, realistic portraiture of the deceased was )Tj
T*(introduced and family groups were often depicted in bas-relief on monuments, )Tj
T*(usually surrounded by an architectural frame.[22] The walls of tomb chambers )Tj
T*(were often painted in fresco, although few examples have survived in as good )Tj
T*(condition as the Tomb of the Diver from southern Italy or the tombs at Vergina )Tj
T*(in Macedon. Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek )Tj
T*(tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The Fayum mummy portraits, )Tj
T*(from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a )Tj
T*(Graeco-Roman style, attached to mummies.[23] )Tj
T*( Early Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of )Tj
T*(pottery, and remains were also buried in urns. Pottery continued to be used )Tj
T*(extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.[24] The )Tj
T*(larnax is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated terracotta. The )Tj
T*(two-handled loutrophoros was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used )Tj
T*(to carry water for the nuptial bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs )Tj
T*(of the unmarried, "presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed )Tj
T*(in life."[25] The one-handled lekythos had many household uses, but outside the )Tj
T*(household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.[26] Scenes of a )Tj
T*(descent to the underworld of Hades were often painted on these, with the dead )Tj
T*(depicted beside Hermes, Charon or bothâ€”though usually only with Charon.[27] )Tj
T*(Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these )Tj
T*(were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the Hellenistic )Tj
T*(Tanagra figurines, this seems probably not the case.[28] But silverware is more )Tj
T*(often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal Macedonian )Tj
T*(tombs of Vergina, or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of Thrace or )Tj
T*(the Scythians.[29] )Tj
T*( The extension of the Greek world after the conquests of Alexander the Great )Tj
T*(brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the Hellenistic )Tj
T*(sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.[30] A generation )Tj
T*(before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized satrap or semi-independent ruler )Tj
T*(under the Persian Empire, whose enormous tomb \(begun 353Â BCE\) was wholly )Tj
T*(exceptional in the Greek world â€“ together with the Pyramids it was the only )Tj
T*(tomb to be included in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The exact form )Tj
T*(of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which gave the name to the form, is now )Tj
T*(unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to )Tj
T*(reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.[31] It )Tj
T*(had the size and some elements of the design of the Greek temple, but was much )Tj
T*(more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof. There were quantities )Tj
T*(of large sculpture, of which most of the few surviving pieces are now in the )Tj
T*(British Museum.[32] Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple frieze )Tj
T*(for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great )Tj
T*(influence on Western art up to 18th century Neo-Classicism. The late 4th )Tj
T*(century Alexander Sarcophagus was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern )Tj
T*(ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at Sidon in the modern )Tj
T*(Lebanon. The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the Battle of )Tj
T*(Issus and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious )Tj
T*(classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in )Tj
T*(Roman art of the 2nd century. More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on )Tj
T*(smaller sarcophagi, especially of Bacchus.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Etruscans )Tj
T*( Objects connected with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, form )Tj
T*(the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and )Tj
T*(its art, which once competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was )Tj
T*(eventually absorbed into it.[34] The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often )Tj
T*(incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some )Tj

T*( The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuriesÂ BCE was typically a )Tj
T*(feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. )Tj
T*(Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along )Tj
T*(with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the )Tj
T*(afterlife.[36][37] From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and )Tj
T*(gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved )Tj
T*(ones,[38] often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as )Tj
T*(Charun or the winged female Vanth. The underworld figures are sometimes )Tj
T*(depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away.[39] The )Tj
T*(handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living.[39] )Tj
T*(This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably )Tj
T*(the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the )Tj
T*("handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead )Tj
T*(being greeted in the Underworld".[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ancient Rome )Tj
T*( The burial customs of the ancient Romans were influenced by both of the first )Tj
T*(significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, )Tj
T*(namely the Greeks of Magna Graecia and the Etruscans.[40] The original Roman )Tj
T*(custom was cremation, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, )Tj
T*(ash-chest or urn, often in a columbarium; pre-Roman burials around Rome often )Tj
T*(used hut-urnsâ€”little pottery houses.[41] From about the 2nd centuryÂ CE, )Tj
T*(inhumation \(burial of unburnt remains\) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, )Tj
T*(became more fashionable for those who could afford it.[42] Greek-style )Tj
T*(medallion portrait sculptures on a stela, or small mausoleum for the rich, )Tj
T*(housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a )Tj
T*(roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the )Tj
T*(memory of the dead. Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion )Tj
T*(in the afterlife rather than a double burial.[43] )Tj
T*( In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at )Tj
T*(a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style. Family tombs for )Tj
T*(the grandest late Roman families, like the Tomb of the Scipios, were large )Tj
T*(mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and )Tj
T*(bedrooms. The Castel Sant'Angelo, built for Hadrian, was later converted into a )Tj
T*(fortress. Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on )Tj
T*(provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects )Tj
T*(or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.[44] Ancestor portraits, usually )Tj
T*(in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little )Tj
T*(cupboards,[45] although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the )Tj
T*(atrium. They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by )Tj
T*(persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by )Tj
T*(Pliny the Elder and Polybius. Pliny also describes the custom of having a )Tj
T*(bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield \(clipeus\), and )Tj
T*(having it hung in a temple or other public place. No examples of either type )Tj
T*(have survived.[46] )Tj
T*( By the late Republic there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans )Tj
T*(for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the )Tj
T*(city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to )Tj
T*(catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the )Tj
T*(deceased and increase the prestige of their family. Examples include the Tomb )Tj
T*(of Eurysaces the Baker, a freedman, the Pyramid of Cestius, and the Mausoleum )Tj
T*(of Caecilia Metella, all built within a few decades of the start of the Common )Tj
T*(Era.[47] )Tj
T*( In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the )Tj
T*(tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing )Tj
T*(styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art )Tj
T*(became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in )Tj
T*(the 2nd century Portonaccio sarcophagus, and various styles and forms emerged, )Tj
T*(such as the columnar type with an "architectural background of columns and )Tj
T*(niches for its figures".[48] A well-known Early Christian example is the )Tj

T*(ideas in narrative scenes from Greek mythology, treated allegorically;[50] they )Tj

T*( Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers )Tj

T*(now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers. Knowledge of )Tj
T*(pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at )Tj
T*(Sanxingdui and other sites. Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, )Tj

T*(funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.[52] )Tj
T*( The discovery in 1974 of the Terracotta army located the tomb of the First Qin )Tj
T*(Emperor \(died 210Â BCE\), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions )Tj
T*(survive, has not been excavated. Remains surviving above ground from several )Tj
T*(imperial tombs of the Han dynasty show traditions maintained until the end of )Tj
T*(imperial rule. The tomb itself is an "underground palace" beneath a sealed )Tj
T*(tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away )Tj
T*(down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accommodation )Tj
T*(of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as )Tj
T*(gateways, towers and other buildings. )Tj
T*( Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a "spirit road", sometimes )Tj
T*(several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both )Tj
T*(humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on )Tj
T*(a stone tortoise \(bixi\) is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs )Tj
T*(the guardian figures are mainly of "lions" and "chimeras"; in later periods )Tj
T*(they are much more varied.[53] A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress )Tj
T*(Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th )Tj
T*(century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a )Tj
T*(generally well-preserved ensemble.[54] )Tj
T*( The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries )Tj
T*(which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the )Tj
T*(Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with )Tj
T*(such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, )Tj
T*(that the current policy is to leave them undisturbed.[55] )Tj
T*( The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler )Tj
T*(middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd century Wu Family tombs of )Tj
T*(Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for )Tj
T*(funerary stones.[56] The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of )Tj
T*(tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved )Tj
T*(or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now )Tj
T*(the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A )Tj
T*(cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed )Tj
T*(before firing.[57] After the introduction of Buddhism, carved "funerary )Tj
T*(couches" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.[58] During the Han )Tj
T*(Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the )Tj
T*(deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient )Tj
T*(Chinese architecture. Later, during the Six Dynasties, sculptural miniatures )Tj
T*(depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the )Tj

T*(brick or stone-carved pillar-gates \(que é—•\); an example from 121Â CE appears to )Tj
T*(be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above )Tj

T*( The Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines. Human )Tj
T*(remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island \(out of 20,000 )Tj
T*(total\)[77] were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as )Tj

T*(gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave )Tj
T*(occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of )Tj
T*(goddesses.[78] )Tj

T*(exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian )Tj
T*(and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items \(see this Flickr photo for a )Tj
T*(reconstruction\). Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including )Tj
T*(village scenes, for example, players engaged in a Mesoamerican ballgame. )Tj
T*(Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed )Tj

T*( [edit] Christianity )Tj
T*( The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early )Tj
T*(Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They )Tj
T*(show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative )Tj
T*(art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, )Tj
T*(Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were )Tj
T*(decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, )Tj
T*(later, narrative religious scenes.[96] The Early Christians' habit, after the )Tj
T*(end of their persecution, of building churches \(most famously St Peter's, Rome\) )Tj
T*(over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or )Tj
T*(in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian )Tj
T*(funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church.[97] The beliefs of )Tj
T*(many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, )Tj
T*(consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries )Tj
T*(\(though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture\).[98] )Tj
T*( Christians believed in a bodily resurrection of the dead at the Second Coming )Tj
T*(of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in )Tj
T*(1963.[99] Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial has always been )Tj
T*(the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for )Tj
T*(as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with )Tj
T*(a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside )Tj
T*(it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a )Tj
T*(sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church )Tj
T*(floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, )Tj
T*(might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an )Tj
T*(elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the )Tj
T*(shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument )Tj
T*(to MaximilianÂ I, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to )Tj
T*(complete,[100] while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several )Tj
T*(centuries to reach its final form.[101] )Tj
T*( If only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size )Tj
T*(sculpture, Eastern Orthodoxy could not have developed the tomb monument in the )Tj
T*(same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important )Tj
T*(individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, )Tj
T*(with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until )Tj
T*(just simple religious symbols were left. ConstantineÂ I and most later Byzantine )Tj
T*(Emperors up to 1028 were buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles in )Tj
T*(Constantinople, which was destroyed after the fall of Constantinople of 1453. )Tj
T*(Some massive but mostly plain porphyry sarcophagi from the church are now )Tj
T*(placed outside the Istanbul Archaeology Museums.[102] )Tj
T*( The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII in Florence is a grand Early Renaissance wall )Tj
T*(tomb by Donatello and Michelozzo; although classical in style, it reflects the )Tj
T*(somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic )Tj
T*(tombs. It has a life-size effigy lying on the sarcophagus, which was common )Tj
T*(from the Romanesque period through to the Baroque and beyond.[103] Ruling )Tj
T*(dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the Chartreuse de )Tj
T*(Champmol was founded for that purpose by the Valois Dukes of Burgundy in 1383. )Tj
T*(The Scaliger tombs in Verona are magnificent free-standing Gothic canopied )Tj

T*(chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests )Tj
T*(would pay for masses to be said in perpetuity for their souls. By the High )Tj
T*(Renaissance, led by Michelangelo's tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, )Tj
T*(and later may stand. Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing )Tj
T*(it in profile.[105] )Tj
T*( In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, )Tj
T*(explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or )Tj
T*(even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common )Tj
T*(in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs )Tj
T*(like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or "Art of )Tj
T*(Dying".[106] It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become )Tj
T*(popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope UrbanÂ VIII by Bernini )Tj
T*(\(1628â€“1647\), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a )Tj
T*(tablet below his enthroned effigy.[107] As cities became more crowded, bones )Tj
T*(were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they )Tj
T*(might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the )Tj
T*(Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones. )Tj
T*( The church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods )Tj
T*(except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings. )Tj
T*(Kings might be buried with a sceptre, and bishops with a crozier, their )Tj
T*(respective symbols of office.[108] The 7th century Stonyhurst Gospel, with a )Tj
T*(unique Insular original leather binding, was recovered from St Cuthbert's )Tj
T*(coffin, itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, )Tj
T*(which he had very likely scribed himself.[109] The armour and sword of a knight )Tj
T*(might be hung over his tomb, as those of the Black Prince still are in )Tj
T*(Canterbury Cathedral. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of )Tj
T*(historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white winding-sheet, as )Tj
T*(being all that would be required at the Second Coming. For centuries, most )Tj
T*(except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was )Tj
T*(very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living. )Tj
T*(The use of a rich cloth pall to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during )Tj
T*(the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only )Tj
T*(later black. They were usually then given to the Church to use for vestments or )Tj
T*(other decorations.[110] )Tj
T*( From the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of )Tj
T*(the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the )Tj
T*(monumental brass, a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons )Tj
T*(commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural )Tj
T*(surround. They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide )Tj
T*(valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women. Many bishops )Tj
T*(and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.[111] )Tj
T*( The castrum doloris was a temporary catafalque erected around the coffin for )Tj
T*(the lying in state of important people, usually in a church, the funerary )Tj
T*(version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, )Tj
T*(like royal entries. These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their )Tj
T*(height of elaboration in the 18th century.[112] A particular feature in Poland )Tj
T*(was the coffin portrait, a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, )Tj
T*(attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the )Tj
T*(church. Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. Hatchments were a )Tj
T*(special lozenge-shaped painted coat of arms which was displayed on the house of )Tj
T*(the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the )Tj
T*(church. Like mourning clothes, these fall outside a strict definition of )Tj
T*(art.[113] )Tj
T*( For some time after the Protestant Reformation, English church monuments )Tj
T*(formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, )Tj
T*(especially in sculpture. The English upper classes ceased to commission )Tj
T*(altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments )Tj

T*(dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of )Tj
T*(indications might be used to suggest the distinction.[115] )Tj
T*( The large Baroque tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the )Tj
T*(deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, )Tj
T*(Virtues or other figures than angels. The late medieval transi tomb vocabulary )Tj
T*(of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes )Tj
T*(re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.[116]Neo-Classicism, led by )Tj
T*(Antonio Canova, revived the classical stela, either with a portrait or a )Tj
T*(personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the )Tj
T*(demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.[117] )Tj
T*( By the 19th century, many Old World churchyards and church walls had )Tj
T*(completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts )Tj
T*(of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.[118] The rich )Tj
T*(developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, )Tj
T*(while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false )Tj
T*(sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin. The cemeteries of the large Italian )Tj
T*(cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms )Tj
T*(of extravagant statuary, especially the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in )Tj
T*(Genoa, the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano and the Certosa di Bologna.[119] In )Tj
T*(Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types )Tj
T*(during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, )Tj
T*(often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in maquette )Tj
T*(form.[120] Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during )Tj
T*(the 19th century, embracing Symbolism enthusiastically, but then gradually )Tj
T*(became detached from the avant-garde after Art Nouveau and a few Art Deco )Tj
T*(examples.[121] Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial )Tj
T*(stained glass windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a )Tj
T*(commemorative panel, are often found. War memorials, other than on the site of )Tj
T*(a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became )Tj
T*(increasingly common during it, and after World WarÂ I were erected even in )Tj
T*(villages of the main combatant nations.[122] )Tj
T*( Islamic funerary art is dominated by architecture. Grave goods are discouraged )Tj
T*(to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of )Tj
T*(Muslim burials.[123] Royalty and important religious figures were typically )Tj
T*(buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription. )Tj
T*(However, funerary architecture often offered a means of "moving beyond the )Tj
T*(strictures of formal Muslim burial rites" and expressing social dimensions such )Tj
T*(as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.[124] A number of )Tj
T*(distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements. )Tj
T*(The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the hadith "condemn the building of )Tj
T*(tombs, and Muhammad himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked )Tj
T*(grave in one of the chambers of his house" in Medina,[125] though by at least )Tj
T*(the 12th century, buildings of the vast Al-Masjid an-Nabawi complex already )Tj
T*(marked the site. The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in Samarra in )Tj
T*(Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose )Tj
T*(son was buried there.[126] At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea )Tj
T*(of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of Paradise, an )Tj
T*(association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the )Tj
T*(difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of )Tj
T*(this process hard to trace. At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became )Tj
T*(established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing )Tj
T*(pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose. Versions of the )Tj
T*(formal Persian charbagh design were widely used in India, Persia and )Tj
T*(elsewhere.[127] )Tj
T*( Another influence may have been the octagonal Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, )Tj
T*(not a mausoleum itself, but "the earliest Islamic model for centrally planned )Tj
T*(commemorative buildings", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a )Tj
T*(building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a )Tj
T*(garden.[128] In the Persian sphere, a tradition of relatively small mausoleums )Tj

T*(single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the Timurid and )Tj
T*(Mughal Empires,[129] like the Gur-e Amir tomb of Timur at Samarkand and the )Tj
T*(famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the Taj Mahal. The Mughal )Tj
T*(tombs are mostly set in a large walled charbagh \(chahar-bagh\) or Mughal )Tj
T*(gardens, often with pavilions at the corners[129] and a gatehouse. The Taj )Tj
T*(Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river )Tj
T*(Yamuna; a central placing is usual.[130] They may have minarets, although they )Tj
T*(do not normally function as mosques. The Tomb of Jahangir lacks any dome,[131] )Tj
T*(while the Tomb of Akbar the Great has only small decorative ones. Other Islamic )Tj
T*(Indian rulers built similar tombs, such as Gol Gumbaz. )Tj
T*( In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was )Tj
T*(adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard. )Tj
T*(Decoration was often tilework, and could include parchin kari inlays in )Tj
T*(semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving. No animals would be )Tj
T*(represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common. The )Tj
T*(sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille )Tj
T*(of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room. Money would be bequeathed )Tj
T*(to pay for continuous readings of the Qur'an in the mausoleum, and they were )Tj
T*(normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The Mausoleum of Khomeini, )Tj
T*(still under construction in a Tehran cemetery, and intended to be the centre of )Tj
T*(a huge complex, continues these traditions.[132] )Tj
T*( The tradition evolved differently in the Ottoman world, where smaller )Tj
T*(single-roomed tÃ¼rbe typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often )Tj
T*(built by the deceased. The sarcophagi \(often purely symbolic, as the body is )Tj
T*(below the floor\) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth )Tj
T*(or stone turban, which is also traditional at the top of ordinary Turkish )Tj
T*(gravestones \(usually in stylised form\). Two of the most famous are in the )Tj
T*(SÃ¼leymaniye Mosque in Istanbul; the YeÅŸil TÃ¼rbe \("Green Tomb"\) of 1421 is an )Tj
T*(unusually large example in Bursa, and also unusual in having extensive tile )Tj
T*(work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often )Tj
T*(decorated with brightly colored tiles.[133] )Tj
T*( Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions. )Tj
T*(The 15th century royal Tomb of Askia in Mali used the local technique of )Tj
T*(mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque )Tj
T*(complex.[134] At the other end of the Islamic world, Javanese royalty are )Tj
T*(mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at Kota Gede and Imogiri. )Tj
T*( In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room )Tj
T*(inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, )Tj
T*(madrasah or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common. The )Tj
T*(tomb-mosque of Sultan Qaitbay \(died 1496\) is a famous example, one of many in )Tj
T*(Cairo, though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the )Tj
T*(whole.[135] )Tj
T*( [edit] Modern period )Tj
T*( Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in )Tj
T*(various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect )Tj
T*(modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments to the dead continue to be )Tj
T*(erected, especially war memorials. Some are fairly traditional, while those )Tj
T*(reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and )Tj
T*(several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv )Tj
T*(Memorial in Paris \(1994\), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin )Tj
T*(\(2004\), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna \(2000\). These are in )Tj
T*(notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World )Tj
T*(War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World WarÂ I were sometimes )Tj
T*(removed after a time as inappropriate.[136] Some war memorials, especially in )Tj
T*(countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the )Tj

T*(was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie B. Nunn. Four years later, )Tj
T*(Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic primary en route to the )Tj
T*(governorship. )Tj
T*( As governor, Ford made government more efficient by reorganizing and )Tj
T*(consolidating some departments in the executive branch. He raised revenue for )Tj
T*(the state through a severance tax on coal and enacted reforms to the )Tj
T*(educational system. He purged most of the Republicans from statewide office, )Tj
T*(including helping Walter "Dee" Huddleston win the Senate seat vacated by the )Tj
T*(retirement of Republican stalwart John Sherman Cooper. In 1974, Ford himself )Tj
T*(ousted the other incumbent senator, Republican Marlow Cook. Due to the rapid )Tj
T*(rise of Ford and many of his political allies, he and his lieutenant governor, )Tj
T*(Julian Carroll, were investigated on charges of political corruption, but a )Tj
T*(grand jury refused to indict them. As senator, Ford was a staunch defender of )Tj
T*(Kentucky's tobacco industry. He also formed the Senate National Guard Caucus )Tj
T*(with Missouri senator Kit Bond. Chosen as Democratic party whip in 1991, Ford )Tj
T*(considered running for floor leader in 1994 before throwing his support to )Tj
T*(Connecticut's Christopher Dodd. He retired from the Senate in 1999 and returned )Tj
T*(to Owensboro, where he teaches politics to youth at the Owensboro Museum of )Tj
T*(Science and History. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Wendell Ford was born near Owensboro in Daviess County, Kentucky on September )Tj
T*(8, 1924.[3] He was the son of Ernest M. and Irene Woolfork \(Schenk\) Ford.[4] )Tj
T*(His father was a state senator and ally of Kentucky Governor Earle C. )Tj
T*(Clements.[2] Ford obtained his early education in the public schools of Daviess )Tj
T*(County and graduated from Daviess County High School.[5] From 1942 to 1943, he )Tj
T*(attended the University of Kentucky.[3] )Tj
T*( On September 18, 1943, Ford married Jean Neel of Owensboro at the home of the )Tj
T*(bride's parents.[6] The couple had two children. Daughter Shirley \(Ford\) Dexter )Tj
T*(was born in 1950 and son Steven Ford was born in 1954.[2][6] The family )Tj
T*(attended First Baptist Church in Owensboro.[6] )Tj
T*( In 1944, Ford left the University of Kentucky to join the army, enlisting for )Tj
T*(service in World War II on July 22, 1944.[7] He was trained as an )Tj
T*(administrative non-commissioned officer and promoted to the rank of technical )Tj
T*(sergeant on November 17, 1945.[7] Over the course of his service, he received )Tj
T*(the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal and earned the )Tj
T*(Expert Infantryman Badge and Good Conduct Medal.[7] He was honorably discharged )Tj
T*(on June 18, 1946.[4] )Tj
T*( Following the war, Ford returned home to work with his father in the family )Tj
T*(insurance business, and graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance in )Tj
T*(1947.[3][4] On June 7, 1949, he enlisted in the Kentucky Army National Guard )Tj
T*(and was assigned to Company I of the 149th Infantry Regimental Combat Team in )Tj
T*(Owensboro.[7] On August 7, 1949, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of )Tj
T*(Infantry.[7] In 1949, Ford's company was converted from infantry to tanks, and )Tj
T*(Ford served as a Company Commander in the 240th Tank Battalion.[7] Promoted to )Tj
T*(First Lieutenant of Armor, he transferred to the inactive Guard in 1956, before )Tj
T*(being discharged in 1962.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Political career )Tj
T*( Ford was very active in civic affairs, becoming the first Kentuckian to serve )Tj
T*(as president of the Jaycees in 1954.[2][4] He was a youth chairman of Bert T. )Tj
T*(Combs' 1959 gubernatorial campaign.[2] After Combs' election, Ford served as )Tj
T*(Combs' executive assistant from 1959 to 1963.[3] When his mother died in 1963, )Tj
T*(Ford returned to Owensboro to help his father with the family insurance )Tj
T*(agency.[2] Although it was speculated he would run for lieutenant governor that )Tj
T*(year, Ford later insisted he had decided not to re-enter politics until )Tj
T*(Governor Ned Breathitt asked him to run against Casper "Cap" Gardner, the state )Tj
T*(senate's majority leader and a major obstacle to Breathitt's progressive )Tj
T*(legislative agenda.[2] Ford won the 1965 election by only 305 votes but quickly )Tj
T*(became a key player in the state senate.[2] Representing the Eighth District, )Tj
T*(including Daviess and Hancock counties, Ford introduced 22 major pieces of )Tj
T*(legislation that became law during his single term in the senate.[4] )Tj

T*( In 1967, Ford ran for lieutenant governor, this time against the wishes of )Tj
T*(Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews.[2] )Tj
T*(Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the )Tj
T*(primary.[2] He ran an independent campaign and won in the general election even )Tj
T*(as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican )Tj
T*(Louie B. Nunn.[2] Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five )Tj
T*(going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.[4] )Tj
T*( During his time as lieutenant governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic )Tj
T*(machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter )Tj
T*(Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins.[2] When Governor Nunn asked the )Tj
T*(legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 )Tj
T*(percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and )Tj
T*(medicine were exempted.[2] Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without )Tj
T*(exemptions.[2] From 1970 to 1971, Ford was a member of the Executive Committee )Tj
T*(of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governor of Kentucky )Tj
T*( At the expiration of his term as lieutenant governor, Ford was one of eight )Tj
T*(candidates to enter the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary.[4] The favorite )Tj
T*(of the field was Ford's mentor, Combs.[4] During the campaign, Ford attacked )Tj
T*(Combs' age and the sales tax enacted during Combs' administration.[9] He also )Tj
T*(questioned why Combs would leave his better-paying federal judgeship to run for )Tj
T*(a second term as governor.[9] Ford garnered more votes than Combs and the other )Tj
T*(six candidates combined, and attributed his unlikely win over Combs in the )Tj
T*(primary to superior strategy and Combs' underestimation.[2][4] Following the )Tj
T*(election, Combs correctly predicted "This is the end of the road for me )Tj
T*(politically."[9] )Tj
T*( Ford went on to win the governorship in a four-way general election that )Tj
T*(included another former Democratic governor, A. B. "Happy" Chandler, who ran as )Tj
T*(an independent.[4] Ford finished more than 58,000 votes ahead of his closest )Tj
T*(rival, Republican Tom Emberton.[4] With Combs and Chandler out of politics, )Tj
T*(factionalism in the Kentucky Democratic Party subsided for the only time in the )Tj
T*(20th century.[9] )Tj
T*( As governor, Ford raised revenue from a severance tax on coal, a )Tj
T*(two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, and an increased corporate tax.[5] He )Tj
T*(balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax.[5] The )Tj
T*(resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction )Tj
T*(projects.[5] His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson )Tj
T*(County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth )Tj
T*(Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center.[2] He )Tj
T*(also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system )Tj
T*(through the first legislative session of his term.[2] )Tj
T*( Ford oversaw the transition of the University of Louisville from municipal to )Tj
T*(state funding.[2] He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving )Tj
T*(up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and )Tj
T*(extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards.[2] )Tj
T*(These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's )Tj
T*(colleges from political rewards to professional appointments.[2] He increased )Tj
T*(funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council )Tj
T*(on Higher Education.[5] He vetoed a measure that would have allowed collective )Tj
T*(bargaining for teachers.[5] )Tj
T*( Ford drew praise for his attention to the mundane task of improving the )Tj
T*(efficiency and organization of executive departments, creating several "super )Tj
T*(cabinets" under which many departments were consolidated.[5][10] During the )Tj
T*(1972 legislative session, he created the Department of Finance and )Tj
T*(Administration, combining the functions of the Kentucky Program Development )Tj
T*(Office and the Department of Finance.[10] Constitutional limits sometimes )Tj
T*(prevented him from combining like functions, but Ford made the reorganization a )Tj
T*(top priority and realized some savings to the state.[10] )Tj

T*(Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months )Tj
T*(in the county, and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting )Tj
T*(eligibility.[13] This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential )Tj
T*(election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the )Tj
T*(necessary corrections.[13] In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's )Tj
T*(agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of )Tj
T*(congressional districts in line with the latest census figures, and )Tj
T*(ratification of the recently-passed Equal Rights Amendment.[14] All of these )Tj
T*(measures passed.[15] )Tj
T*( Despite surgery for a brain aneurysm in June 1972, Ford attended the 1972 )Tj
T*(Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.[15] He supported Edmund )Tj
T*(Muskie for president, but later greeted nominee George McGovern when he visited )Tj
T*(Kentucky.[15] The convention was the beginning of Ford's role in national )Tj
T*(politics.[2] Offended by the McGovern campaign's treatment of Democratic )Tj
T*(finance chairman Robert Schwarz Strauss, he helped Strauss get elected chairman )Tj
T*(of the Democratic National Committee following McGovern's defeat.[2] As a )Tj
T*(result of his involvement in Strauss' election, Ford was elected chair of the )Tj
T*(Democratic Governors' Conference from 1973 to 1974.[8] He also served as )Tj
T*(vice-chair of the Conference's Natural Resources and Environmental Management )Tj
T*(Committee.[10] )Tj
T*( During the 1974 legislative session, Ford proposed a six-year study of coal )Tj
T*(liquefaction and gasification in response to the 1973 oil crisis.[5] He also )Tj
T*(increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the )Tj
T*(executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education )Tj
T*(and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety, and )Tj
T*(justice.[10] He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing )Tj
T*(state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state )Tj
T*(merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers.[15] Despite the )Tj
T*(expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of )Tj
T*(the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration.[15] )Tj
T*(Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit )Tj
T*(examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were )Tj
T*(hired.[15] )Tj
T*( Ford united the state's Democratic Party, allowing them to capture a seat in )Tj
T*(the U.S. Senate in 1972 for the first time since 1956.[4] The seat was vacated )Tj
T*(by the retirement of Republican John Sherman Cooper and won by Ford's campaign )Tj
T*(manager, Walter "Dee" Huddleston.[9] Ford's friends then began lobbying him to )Tj
T*(try and unseat Kentucky's other Republican senator, one-term legislator Marlow )Tj
T*(Cook.[2] Ford wanted lieutenant governor Julian Carroll to run for Cook's seat, )Tj
T*(but Carroll already had his eye on the governor's chair.[2] Ford's allies did )Tj
T*(not have a gubernatorial candidate stronger than Carroll, and when a poll )Tj
T*(showed that Ford was the only Democrat who could defeat Cook, he agreed to run, )Tj
T*(announcing his candidacy immediately following the 1974 legislative session.[2] )Tj
T*( A primary issue during the election was the construction of a dam on the Red )Tj
T*(River.[16] Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of )Tj
T*(the state's budget surplus to its construction.[16] In the election, Ford )Tj
T*(defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of )Tj
T*(the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from )Tj
T*(major office.[2] Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a )Tj
T*(higher standing in seniority in the Senate.[16] Ford resigned as governor to )Tj
T*(accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll.[4] )Tj
T*( In the wake of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the )Tj
T*(major political office, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption )Tj
T*(probe.[2] The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state )Tj
T*(insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure.[2] In )Tj
T*(June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of )Tj
T*(his political backers without competitive bidding.[15] State law did not )Tj
T*(require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar )Tj

T*(officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political )Tj
T*(benefit rather than personal financial gain.[17] In 1981, prosecutors asked for )Tj
T*(indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury )Tj
T*(refused.[2] Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred )Tj
T*(has never been publicly revealed.[2] However, state Republicans maintained that )Tj
T*(Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against )Tj
T*(self-incrimination.[2] Ford refused to confirm or deny this report.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] United States Senate )Tj
T*( Ford entered the Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992.[3] )Tj
T*(In the 1980 primary, Ford received only token opposition from attorney Flora )Tj
T*(Stuart.[18] He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries.[19][20] )Tj
T*(Republicans failed to put forward a viable challenger during any of Ford's )Tj
T*(re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary )Tj
T*(Louise Foust by 334,862 votes.[21] Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 percent )Tj
T*(of the total votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in )Tj
T*(Kentucky.[21] Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered )Tj
T*(that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 )Tj
T*(Kentucky counties.[21] State senator David L. Williams fared little better in )Tj
T*(1992, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford \(63 percent\).[22] )Tj
T*( Ford seriously considered leaving the Senate and running for governor again in )Tj
T*(1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times.[2] In the 1983 contest, he )Tj
T*(would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the )Tj
T*(primary.[2] Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his )Tj
T*(decision.[2] In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to )Tj
T*(become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for )Tj
T*(governor.[23] )Tj
T*( Early in his career, Ford supported a constitutional amendment against )Tj
T*(desegregation busing.[2] He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget )Tj
T*(on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget )Tj
T*(wrangling.[24] This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, )Tj
T*(was never implemented.[24] During the Ninety-fifth Congress \(1977â€“1979\), he was )Tj
T*(chairman of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.[3] )Tj
T*( From 1977 to 1983, Ford was a member of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign )Tj
T*(Committee.[3] He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to )Tj
T*(California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977.[25] Ford got a )Tj
T*(late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he )Tj
T*(overestimated his chances of unseating Cranston.[25] Immediately after )Tj
T*(conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in )Tj
T*(the next election in 1990.[25] He again faced Cranston in the election, but )Tj
T*(Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer.[25] Ford )Tj
T*(maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus )Tj
T*(to have won without Cranston's withdrawal.[25] When majority leader George J. )Tj
T*(Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the )Tj
T*(Democratic floor leader post.[2] Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to )Tj
T*(focus instead on Kentucky issues.[2] He supported Christopher Dodd for majority )Tj
T*(leader.[2] )Tj
T*( During the Ninety-eighth Congress \(1983â€“1985\), Ford served on the Select )Tj
T*(Committee to Study the Committee System, and he was a member of the Committee )Tj
T*(on Rules and Administration in the One Hundredth through One Hundred Third )Tj
T*(Congresses \(1987â€“1995\).[3] In 1989, he joined with Missouri senator Kit Bond to )Tj
T*(form the Senate National Guard Caucus, a coalition of senators committed to )Tj
T*(advancing National Guard capabilities and readiness.[26] Ford said he was )Tj
T*(motivated to form the caucus after seeing the work done by Mississippi )Tj
T*(Representative Sonny Montgomery with the National Guard Association and the )Tj
T*(National Guard Bureau.[26] Ford co-chaired the caucus with Bond until Ford's )Tj
T*(retirement from the Senate in 1999.[26] The Kentucky Army Guard dedicated the )Tj
T*(Wendell H. Ford Training Center in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky in 1998.[27] In )Tj

T*( Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton opined that Ford and Dee Huddleston made )Tj
T*("probably the best one-two combination for any state in the Senate."[29] Both )Tj
T*(were defenders of tobacco, Kentucky's primary cash crop.[29] Ford sat on the )Tj
T*(Commerce Committee, influencing legislation affecting the manufacturing end of )Tj
T*(the tobacco industry, while Huddleston sat on the Agriculture Committee and )Tj
T*(protected programs that benefited tobacco farmers.[29] Both were instrumental )Tj
T*(in salvaging the Tobacco Price Support Program.[2][29] Ford got tobacco )Tj
T*(exempted from the Consumer Product Safety Act and was a consistent opponent of )Tj
T*(cigarette tax increases.[2] He sponsored an amendment to the General Agreement )Tj
T*(on Tariffs and Trade that limited the amount of foreign tobacco that could be )Tj
T*(imported by the United States.[24] )Tj
T*( Later in his career, Ford split with Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, )Tj
T*(over a proposed settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies.[2] Ford )Tj
T*(favored the package as presented to Congress, which would have protected the )Tj
T*(price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco )Tj
T*(farmers and an end to the price support program.[2] Both proposals were )Tj
T*(ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.[2] )Tj
T*( As chairman of the Commerce Committee's aviation subcommittee, Ford secured )Tj
T*(funds to improve the airports in Louisville, northern Kentucky, and )Tj
T*(Glasgow.[2][16][24] The Wendell H. Ford Airport in Hazard, Kentucky is named )Tj
T*(for him. A 1990 bill aimed at reducing aircraft noise, improving airline safety )Tj
T*(measures, and requiring airlines to better inform consumers about their )Tj
T*(performance was dubbed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act )Tj
T*(for the 21st Century.[2][24] )Tj
T*( Of his career in the Senate, Ford said "I wasn't interested in national )Tj
T*(issues. I was interested in Kentucky issues."[2] Nevertheless, he influenced )Tj
T*(several important pieces of federal legislation. He sponsored an amendment to )Tj
T*(the Family Medical Leave Act exempting businesses with fewer than fifty )Tj
T*(employees.[24] He was a key player in securing passage of the motor voter law )Tj
T*(in 1993.[16] He supported increases to the federal minimum wage and a 1996 )Tj
T*(welfare reform bill.[24] A supporter of research into clean coal technology, he )Tj
T*(also worked with West Virginia senator Jay Rockefeller to secure better )Tj
T*(retirement benefits for coal miners.[24] Never known as a major player on )Tj
T*(international issues, Ford favored continued economic sanctions against Iraq as )Tj
T*(an alternative to the Gulf War.[24] He voted against the Panama Canal Treaty, )Tj
T*(which he perceived to be unpopular with Kentucky voters.[16] Despite having )Tj
T*(chaired Bill Clinton's inaugural committee in 1993, Ford broke with the )Tj
T*(administration by voting against the North American Free Trade Agreement )Tj
T*(.[2][30] )Tj
T*( As he had as governor of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the )Tj
T*(efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing )Tj
T*(during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the )Tj
T*(government millions of dollars in printing costs by printing in volume and )Tj
T*(using recycled paper.[3][16][24] In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner )Tj

T*( Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, the sufferer relies on others )Tj
T*(for assistance. The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or )Tj
T*(a close relative.[14] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden )Tj
T*(on caregivers; the pressures can be wide-ranging, involving social, )Tj

T*( Characteristics )Tj
T*( The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of )Tj
T*(cognitive and functional impairments. )Tj
T*( Pre-dementia )Tj
T*( The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress.[5] )Tj
T*(Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up )Tj
T*(to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of )Tj
T*(AD.[20] These early symptoms can affect the most complex daily living )Tj
T*(activities.[21] The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as )Tj
T*(difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new )Tj
T*(information.[20][22] )Tj
T*( Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, )Tj
T*(flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory \(memory )Tj
T*(of meanings, and concept relationships\) can also be symptomatic of the early )Tj
T*(stages of AD.[20]Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most )Tj
T*(persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease.[23] )Tj
T*(The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed mild cognitive )Tj
T*(impairment,[22] but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic )Tj
T*(stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute.[24] )Tj
T*( Early )Tj
T*( In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually )Tj
T*(leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with )Tj
T*(language, executive functions, perception \(agnosia\), or execution of movements )Tj
T*(\(apraxia\) are more prominent than memory problems.[25] AD does not affect all )Tj
T*(memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life \(episodic )Tj
T*(memory\), facts learned \(semantic memory\), and implicit memory \(the memory of )Tj
T*(the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat\) are affected to a )Tj
T*(lesser degree than new facts or memories.[26][27] )Tj
T*( Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and )Tj
T*(decreased word fluency, which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and )Tj
T*(written language.[25][28] In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually )Tj
T*(capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.[25][28][29] While performing )Tj
T*(fine motor tasks such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement )Tj
T*(coordination and planning difficulties \(apraxia\) may be present but they are )Tj
T*(commonly unnoticed.[25] As the disease progresses, people with AD can often )Tj
T*(continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or )Tj
T*(supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.[25] )Tj
T*( Moderate )Tj
T*( Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being )Tj
T*(unable to perform most common activities of daily living.[25] Speech )Tj
T*(difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which )Tj
T*(leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions \(paraphasias\). Reading and )Tj
T*(writing skills are also progressively lost.[25][29] Complex motor sequences )Tj
T*(become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of )Tj
T*(falling increases.[25] During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the )Tj
T*(person may fail to recognise close relatives.[25]Long-term memory, which was )Tj
T*(previously intact, becomes impaired.[25] )Tj
T*( Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent. Common )Tj
T*(manifestations are wandering, irritability and labile affect, leading to )Tj
T*(crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to )Tj
T*(caregiving.[25]Sundowning can also appear.[30] Approximately 30% of people with )Tj

T*(stress for relatives and caretakers, which can be reduced by moving the person )Tj

T*( Advanced )Tj
T*( During the final stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon )Tj
T*(caregivers.[25] Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, )Tj
T*(eventually leading to complete loss of speech.[25][29] Despite the loss of )Tj
T*(verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional )Tj
T*(signals.[25] Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and )Tj
T*(exhaustion are much more common results.[25] People with AD will ultimately not )Tj
T*(be able to perform even the simplest tasks without assistance.[25]Muscle mass )Tj
T*(and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose )Tj
T*(the ability to feed themselves.[25] AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of )Tj
T*(death typically being an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers )Tj
T*(or pneumonia, not the disease itself.[25] )Tj
T*( Cause )Tj
T*( The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still essentially unknown[32][33] )Tj
T*(\(except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified\). )Tj
T*(Several competing hypotheses exist trying to explain the cause of the disease: )Tj
T*( Cholinergic hypothesis )Tj
T*( The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the )Tj
T*(cholinergic hypothesis,[34] which proposes that AD is caused by reduced )Tj
T*(synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has )Tj
T*(not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to )Tj
T*(treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic )Tj
T*(effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale )Tj
T*(aggregation of amyloid,[35] leading to generalised neuroinflammation.[36] )Tj
T*( Amyloid hypothesis )Tj
T*( In 1991, the amyloid hypothesis postulated that beta-amyloid \(Î²A\) deposits are )Tj
T*(the fundamental cause of the disease.[37][38] Support for this postulate comes )Tj
T*(from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein \(APP\) on )Tj
T*(chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 \(Down )Tj
T*(Syndrome\) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD by 40Â years )Tj
T*(of age.[39][40] Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major )Tj
T*(genetic risk factor for AD. Whilst apolipoproteins enhance the break down of )Tj
T*(beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task \(such as )Tj
T*(APOE4\), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain.[41] Further evidence )Tj
T*(comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the )Tj
T*(human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain )Tj
T*(pathology with spatial learning deficits.[42] )Tj
T*( An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human )Tj
T*(trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia.[43] Researchers )Tj
T*(have been led to suspect non-plaque Î²A oligomers \(aggregates of many monomers\) )Tj
T*(as the primary pathogenic form of Î²A. These toxic oligomers, also referred to )Tj
T*(as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands \(ADDLs\), bind to a surface receptor on )Tj
T*(neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal )Tj
T*(communication.[44] One receptor for Î²A oligomers may be the prion protein, the )Tj
T*(same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human )Tj
T*(condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying )Tj
T*(mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease.[45] )Tj
T*( In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the )Tj

T*( Disease mechanism )Tj
T*( Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta-amyloid )Tj
T*(peptide gives rise to the pathology of AD is not known.[67] The amyloid )Tj

T*(builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and )Tj
T*(it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by )Tj
T*(neurons.[69] )Tj

T*(expression of their receptors such as the brain derived neurotrophic factor )Tj
T*(\(BDNF\) have been described in AD.[71][72] )Tj
T*( Genetics )Tj
T*( The vast majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, meaning that )Tj
T*(they are not genetically inherited although some genes may act as risk factors. )Tj
T*(On the other hand, around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of autosomal )Tj
T*(dominant \(not sex-linked\) inheritance, which usually have an onset before age )Tj
T*(65.[73] This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease. )Tj
T*( Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one )Tj
T*(of three genes: amyloid precursor protein \(APP\) and presenilins 1 and 2.[74] )Tj
T*(Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a )Tj
T*(small protein called Î²A42, which is the main component of senile plaques.[75] )Tj
T*(Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Î²A42 and the other major )Tj
T*(formsâ€”e.g., Î²A40â€”without increasing Î²A42 levels.[75][76] This suggests that )Tj
T*(presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of )Tj
T*(Î²A produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for )Tj
T*(alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than Î²A. )Tj
T*( Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant )Tj
T*(inheritance and are termed sporadic AD. Nevertheless genetic differences may )Tj
T*(act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of )Tj
T*(the Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E \(APOE\).[77][78] Between 40 and 80% of )Tj
T*(people with AD possess at least one APOEÎµ4 allele.[78] The APOEÎµ4 allele )Tj
T*(increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 )Tj

T*(purely genetic. For example, certain Nigerian populations have no relationship )Tj
T*(between presence or dose of APOEÎµ4 and incidence or age-of-onset for )Tj

T*(of late onset Alzheimer's disease,[74] but results such as the Nigerian studies )Tj
T*(and the incomplete penetrance for all genetic risk factors associated with )Tj

T*(prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results. )Tj
T*(However, epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain )Tj

T*(whether these factors can help to prevent AD.[118] )Tj
T*( Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, )Tj

T*(and course of AD,[119][120]statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have )Tj

T*(may all individually or together reduce the risk and course of Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease.[123] The diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as )Tj
T*(the mechanism of action.[123] There is limited evidence that light to moderate )Tj
T*(use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of )Tj
T*(AD.[124] )Tj
T*( Reviews on the use of vitamins have not found enough evidence of efficacy to )Tj
T*(recommend vitamin C,[125] E,[125][126] or folic acid with or without vitamin )Tj

T*(In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 )Tj

T*(George Fernandes,[240] and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. )Tj

T*( Research directions )Tj
T*( As of 2012[update], the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical )Tj
T*(treatments had been or were being investigated in 1012 clinical trials )Tj
T*(worldwide, and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in PhaseÂ III )Tj
T*(trials, the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies.[12] )Tj
T*( One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease )Tj
T*(pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of )Tj
T*(compounds[248] \(such as apomorphine\) under investigation. Immunotherapy or )Tj
T*(vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study.[249] )Tj
T*(Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat )Tj
T*(people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune )Tj
T*(system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby )Tj
T*(altering the course of the disease.[250] An example of such a vaccine under )Tj
T*(investigation was ACC-001,[251][252] although the trials were suspended in )Tj
T*(2008.[253] Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as )Tj
T*(identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody.[254] Other approaches )Tj
T*(are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108,[255] and metal-protein interaction )Tj
T*(attenuation agents, such as PBT2.[256] A TNFÎ± receptor fusion protein, )Tj
T*(etanercept has showed encouraging results.[257] )Tj
T*( In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the )Tj
T*(course of disease in mild to moderate AD with methylthioninium chloride \(trade )Tj
T*(name rember\), a drug that inhibits tau aggregation,[258][259] and dimebon, an )Tj
T*(antihistamine.[260] The consecutive phase-III trial of dimebon failed to show )Tj
T*(positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints.[261][262][263] )Tj
T*( The common herpes simplex virus HSV-1 has been found to colocate with amyloid )Tj
T*(plaques.[264] This suggested the possibility that AD could be treated or )Tj
T*(prevented with antiviral medication.[264][265] )Tj
T*( Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and )Tj
T*(cognitive functions have been encouraging. Limitations of this research can be )Tj
T*(addressed in future studies with more detailed analyses.[266] )Tj
T*( An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is )Tj
T*(currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to )Tj
T*(detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research )Tj
T*(before it can be made available commercially.[267] )Tj
T*( On December 31, 2012, a NASA-supported study reported that manned spaceflight )Tj

T*( Quatermass and the Pit is a British television science-fiction serial, )Tj
T*(originally transmitted live by BBC Television in December 1958 and January )Tj
T*(1959. It was the third and last of the BBC's Quatermass serials, although the )Tj

T*(Like its predecessors, Quatermass and the Pit was written by Nigel Kneale. )Tj
T*( The series continues the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures, and )Tj
T*(begins with Professor Bernard Quatermass being forced out of his role at the )Tj
T*(British Experimental Rocket Group, with the organisation being passed into )Tj
T*(military control by the British Government. Quatermass and his new colleague )Tj
T*(Colonel Breen become involved in the discovery of a bizarre object at an )Tj
T*(archaeological dig in Knightsbridge, London. As the serial progresses, )Tj
T*(Quatermass and his associates find that the contents of the object have a )Tj

T*(justifies licence fees to this day."[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( The Quatermass Experiment \(1953\) and Quatermass II \(1955\) had been critical )Tj
T*(and popular successes for the BBC,[5][6] and in early 1957 the corporation )Tj
T*(decided that they would like a third serial.[7] Nigel Kneale had left the staff )Tj
T*(of the BBC towards the end of 1956, but on 2 May 1957 was contracted to write )Tj
T*(the new scripts on a freelance basis.[7] The director assigned to the project )Tj
T*(was Rudolph Cartier, with whom Kneale particularly enjoyed working;[8] the two )Tj
T*(men had collaborated on both of the previous Quatermass serials, as well as the )Tj
T*(literary adaptations Wuthering Heights \(1953\) and Nineteen Eighty-Four )Tj
T*(\(1954\).[9]Quatermass and the Pit had a larger budget than the previous )Tj
T*(Quatermass productions, with Â£17,500 being allocated to the serial.[10] Kneale )Tj
T*(was keen to write a story that would work as an allegory for the racial )Tj
T*(tensions that had recently been seen in the United Kingdom, which eventually )Tj
T*(culminated with the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.[11] )Tj
T*( Pre-production work began in September 1958, while Cartier was still working )Tj
T*(on productions of A Tale of Two Cities and A Midsummer Night's Dream for the )Tj
T*(BBC.[7] As the two previous Quatermass serials had been scheduled in half-hour )Tj
T*(slots but, performed live, had often overrun, Cartier requested thirty-five )Tj
T*(minute slots for the six episodes of Quatermass and the Pit.[7] This was agreed )Tj
T*(to by the BBC drama department management in November 1958, just prior to the )Tj
T*(start of production proper on 24 November.[7] The six episodesâ€”"The Halfmen", )Tj
T*("The Ghosts", "Imps and Demons", "The Enchanted", "The Wild Hunt" and )Tj
T*("Hob"â€”were broadcast on Monday nights at 8pm from 22 December 1958 to 26 )Tj
T*(January 1959.[7] )Tj
T*( Each episode of Quatermass and the Pit was predominantly performed live from )Tj
T*(Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios complex in Hammersmith, London.[7] The )Tj
T*(episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday before broadcast, usually at )Tj
T*(the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals )Tj
T*(taking place in studio on the morning and afternoon of transmission.[7] Not )Tj
T*(every scene was liveâ€”a significant amount of material was pre-filmed on 35 mm )Tj
T*(film and inserted during the performance as required.[7] Most of the )Tj
T*(pre-filming involved either scenes set on location or those that were too )Tj
T*(technically complex or expansive to achieve live.[7] The latter were shot at )Tj
T*(Ealing Studios, which had been acquired by the BBC in 1955,[12] with Cartier )Tj
T*(working with the experienced cinematographer A. A. Englander.[13] Pre-filming )Tj
T*(was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode, with the )Tj
T*(archaeological dig set at Ealing shown to have dug deeper into the ground than )Tj
T*(the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of timescale that would not )Tj
T*(have been possible in an all-live production.[7] )Tj
T*( Special effects requirements were handled by the BBC Visual Effects )Tj
T*(Department, which had been formed by Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine in 1954.[14] )Tj
T*(Usually either Kine or Wilkie individually would oversee effects work on a )Tj
T*(production; due to the number of effects required, both worked on Quatermass )Tj
T*(and the Pit.[15] The team pre-filmed most of their effects for use during the )Tj
T*(live broadcasts.[10] They also oversaw practical effects for the Ealing filming )Tj
T*(and Riverside transmission,[7] and constructed the bodies of the Martian )Tj
T*(creatures.[16] )Tj
T*( The music for the serial was credited to 'Trevor Duncan' a pseudonym used by )Tj
T*(composer Leonard Treblico, whose music was obtained from stock )Tj
T*(discs.[7]Quatermass and the Pit also made extensive use of sound effects and )Tj
T*(electronic music to create an eerie, disturbing atmosphere.[17] These tracks )Tj
T*(were created especially for the serial by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, )Tj
T*(overseen by Desmond Briscoe; their work on Quatermass and the Pit was one of )Tj
T*(the productions for which Briscoe and the Workshop became most )Tj
T*(renowned.[18][19] It was the first time that electronic music had been used in )Tj
T*(a science-fiction television production.[19] )Tj
T*( After Quatermass and the Pit, Kneale felt that it was time to rest the )Tj
T*(character. "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had )Tj

T*(already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed )Tj
T*(to me to be quite enough", he told an interviewer in 1986.[20] By the early )Tj
T*(1970s however, Kneale decided there were some new avenues to explore with the )Tj
T*(character,[20] and the BBC announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass )Tj
T*(serial in 1972.[21] This was not in the event made by the BBC, but Kneale's )Tj
T*(scripts did eventually see production in 1979, as a four-part serial for Thames )Tj
T*(Television called Quatermass.[22] )Tj
T*( Made just prior to the introduction of early videotape machines into general )Tj
T*(use at the BBC, all six episodes of Quatermass and the Pit were preserved for a )Tj
T*(possible repeat by being telerecorded onto 35Â mm film.[7] Although this )Tj
T*(effectively worked by pointing a synchronised film camera at a television )Tj
T*(monitor and filming the output, the process had been refined throughout the )Tj
T*(1950s and the recordings made of Quatermass and the Pit were of a high )Tj
T*(technical quality.[23] The serial was repeated in edited form as two 90-minute )Tj
T*(episodesâ€”titled "5 Million Years Old" and "Hob"â€”on 26 December 1959 and 2 )Tj
T*(January 1960.[7] The third episode, "Imps and Demons", was re-shown on BBC Two )Tj
T*(on 7 November 1986 as part of the "TV50" season, celebrating fifty years of BBC )Tj
T*(television.[7] )Tj
T*( A pre-human skull is discovered while building works are taking place in the )Tj
T*(fictional Hobbs Lane \(formerly Hob's Lane, from an old name for the Devil\) in )Tj
T*(Knightsbridge. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the recovered )Tj
T*(remains, which are many thousands of years old, and reconstructs a dwarf-like )Tj
T*(humanoid with an unusually large brain volume, which he believes to be a form )Tj
T*(of primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken on the site, something )Tj
T*(that looks like a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted )Tj
T*(as the military believe it to be an unexploded bomb left over from World War )Tj
T*(II. )Tj
T*( Roney calls in his old friend Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British )Tj
T*(Rocket Group, an expert on matters of unusual scientific background, to stop )Tj
T*(the military from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. )Tj
T*(Quatermass and Colonel Breen, who has been placed in charge of the Rocket Group )Tj
T*(over Quatermass's objections, become intrigued by the site. More and more of )Tj
T*(the artefact is uncovered, and additional fossils are found inside which Roney )Tj
T*(dates to five million years in ageâ€”suggesting that the object is at least that )Tj
T*(old as well. The interior is empty, but a symbol consisting of five )Tj
T*(intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult pentagram, is found )Tj
T*(etched on an interior wall which appears to hide an inner chamber. )Tj
T*( The shell of the object is so hard that even a borazon drill makes no )Tj
T*(impression, and when the attempt is made, strange vibrations cause severe )Tj
T*(distress in the people around the object. Quatermass interviews the local )Tj
T*(residents and discovers that sightings of ghosts and other poltergeist activity )Tj
T*(have been common in the area for decades. Meanwhile, a soldier is carried out )Tj
T*(of the object in hysterics â€” he claims to have seen a dwarf-like apparition )Tj
T*(walk through the wall of the artefact, a description which matches a 1927 )Tj
T*(newspaper account of a ghost sighting. )Tj
T*( Following the drilling attempt, a hole has somehow opened up in the wall which )Tj
T*(allows Quatermass and the others access to the interior chamber. There they )Tj
T*(find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, )Tj
T*(with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As )Tj
T*(Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise that the aliens might )Tj
T*(have come from a nearby planet which was habitable five million years ago â€” )Tj
T*(Mars. )Tj
T*( Meanwhile, the borazon drill operator clearing his equipment from the craft )Tj
T*(triggers off more poltergeist activity. The operator is forced to run through )Tj
T*(the streets in a dazed panic until he finds sanctuary inside a local church. )Tj
T*(Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect )Tj
T*(aliens killing each other. As Quatermass investigates deeper into the history )Tj
T*(of the area, he finds accounts dating back to medieval times about devils and )Tj
T*(ghosts, all tending to be centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. )Tj

T*(behind on the alien ship and is being seen by certain people who come in )Tj
T*(contact with it. )Tj
T*( Quatermass plans to use an invention of Roney's, an "optic-encephalogram", to )Tj
T*(see these visions. The device will record impressions from the optical centres )Tj
T*(of the brain, in effect showing whatever the subject is seeing, hallucinatory )Tj
T*(or not. He wears the device and goes into the craft, but it is Roney's )Tj
T*(assistant, Barbara Judd, who is affected most. Placing the device on her, they )Tj
T*(record what she "sees"â€”a violent, bloody purge of the Martian hive, to root out )Tj
T*(unwanted mutations. )Tj
T*( Quatermass begins to have a working theory as to what is going on. He believes )Tj
T*(that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race. Some humans )Tj
T*(were taken away and genetically altered to have special abilities such as )Tj
T*(telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then brought back to )Tj
T*(Earth â€” the buried artefact was one of the return ships that had crashed. The )Tj
T*(idea was that, with their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change )Tj
T*(humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities like theirs, created in their )Tj
T*(own mental image, but with a bodily form adapted to Earth. In effect, humanity )Tj
T*(are the Martians. )Tj
T*( However, the plan was a partial failure: the aliens died out before completing )Tj
T*(their work, and as the human race bred and further evolved, only a percentage )Tj
T*(of it retained these abilities, with even these only surfacing sporadically. )Tj
T*(For centuries the buried ship itself had been occasionally triggering these )Tj
T*(dormant abilities. This explained the reports of poltergeists, people were )Tj
T*(unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around them, the ghost )Tj
T*(sightings being traces of a race memory. It also explained the history of )Tj
T*(witchcraft and why people attributed it to a being they identified as the )Tj
T*(devil; the pentagram would have been the symbol for this alien race. )Tj
T*( The government authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation )Tj
T*(preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They )Tj
T*(believe that the craft is actually a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien )Tj
T*(bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has )Tj
T*(come to. They attribute the vision to an overactive imagination, and intend to )Tj
T*(hold a media event to halt the rumours that are already flitting through the )Tj
T*(population. However, Quatermass realises that if these implanted psychic powers )Tj
T*(survive in the human race, there could also still be ingrained in us a )Tj
T*(compulsion to enact the "Wild Hunt" of a race purge. Quatermass is concerned )Tj
T*(that the memories encoded inside the ship, which have already been picked up by )Tj
T*(sensitive people near it, will trigger that impulse and that those affected )Tj
T*(will begin to slaughter their own. )Tj
T*( Despite his warnings, the media event occurs, and the power cables that string )Tj
T*(into the craft fully activate it for the first time. Glowing and humming like a )Tj
T*(living thing, it starts drawing upon this energy source and awakening the )Tj
T*(ancient racial programming. Those people of London in whom the alien admixture )Tj
T*(remains strong fall under the ship's influence; they merge into a group mind )Tj
T*(and begin a telekinetic mass murder of those without the alien genes, an )Tj
T*('ethnic cleansing' of those that the alien race mind considers impure and weak. )Tj
T*( Breen stands transfixed and is eventually consumed by the energies from the )Tj
T*(craft as it slowly melts away and a holographic image of a Martian "devil" )Tj
T*(floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots spread, and even a passing )Tj
T*(aircraft is affected and crashes into the city. Quatermass himself almost )Tj
T*(succumbs to the mass psychosis, attempting to kill Roney, who does not have the )Tj
T*(alien gene and is immune to the influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass )Tj
T*(out of his trance, and together they realise that the floating image is the )Tj
T*(source of the mass psychosis. Even without the craft and electricity, it is now )Tj
T*(draining the combined psychic energy of London. )Tj
T*( Remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, Roney )Tj
T*(deduces that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be enough to )Tj
T*(short the apparition out. Quatermass \(via another soldier, Captain Potter\) gets )Tj
T*(a length of iron chain and tries to reach the "devil" but succumbs to the )Tj
T*(psychic pressure. Roney manages to walk up to the "devil" and hurls the chain, )Tj

T*(about wars, witch-hunts and other communal violence â€” lest we Martians turn the )Tj
T*(Earth into a second dead planet. )Tj
T*( [edit] Cast and crew )Tj
T*( For the third time in as many serials the title role was played by a different )Tj
T*(actor, with AndrÃ© Morell being cast. The part had initially been offered to )Tj
T*(Alec Clunes, who declined the role.[24] Morell had a reputation for playing )Tj
T*(authority figures, such as Colonel Green in The Bridge on the River Kwai )Tj
T*(\(1957\),[25] and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared )Tj
T*(as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four )Tj
T*(\(1954\).[26] He had also been the first actor ever offered the part of )Tj
T*(Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953, but on )Tj
T*(that occasion he had turned the part down.[27] Morell's portrayal of Quatermass )Tj
T*(has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.[28] The )Tj
T*(actor found that it became the role for which he was best remembered by the )Tj
T*(public in later years.[7] )Tj
T*( Colonel Breen was played by Anthony Bushell, who was known for various similar )Tj
T*(military roles â€” including, another bomb disposal officer in The Small Back )Tj
T*(Room \(1949\) â€” and preferred to be addressed as "Major Bushell", the rank he )Tj
T*(held during World War II.[29] He had also worked as Laurence Olivier's manager )Tj
T*(and as a television producer.[29] Before Quatermass and the Pit he had most )Tj
T*(recently been seen as Arthur Rostron in the film version of A Night to Remember )Tj
T*(\(1958\).[30] )Tj
T*( Roney was played by Canadian actor Cec Linder. Linder had appeared in various )Tj
T*(American television series, such as Studio One, and later appeared in Lolita )Tj
T*(\(1962\) and the James Bond film Goldfinger \(1964\).[31]John Stratton played )Tj
T*(Captain Potter; later he become a regular guest actor in a number of British )Tj
T*(television series.[32]Christine Finn played the other main character, Barbara )Tj
T*(Judd; she later voiced various characters in the popular 1960s children's )Tj
T*(television series Thunderbirds.[33] )Tj
T*( For the first time, Kneale used a character from a previous serial other than )Tj
T*(Quatermass himself. He brought back the journalist James Fullalove from The )Tj
T*(Quatermass Experiment, and the production team had hoped that actor Paul )Tj
T*(Whitsun-Jones would be able to reprise the part.[7] Whitsun-Jones was )Tj
T*(unavailable to appear, so Brian Worth was cast instead.[7] Appearing as an army )Tj
T*(sergeant was Michael Ripper; Ripper had been in Hammer Film Productions' )Tj
T*(adaptation of the second Quatermass serial, Quatermass 2, the previous )Tj
T*(year.[34] He had the distinction of appearing in more Hammer films than any )Tj
T*(other actor.[35] )Tj
T*( Nigel Kneale continued his successful career writing for film and television )Tj
T*(after Quatermass and the Pit. He wrote feature film screenplays for The )Tj
T*(Entertainer \(1960\), H.M.S. Defiant \(1962\) and The First Men in the Moon )Tj
T*(\(1964\).[36] He returned to the Quatermass character for a final time with )Tj
T*(Quatermass \(1979\), a serial for the ITV network.[37] He continued writing for )Tj
T*(television until the 1990s,[36][38] and Quatermass and the Pit was often cited )Tj
T*(as the most successful work of his long career.[2][39] )Tj
T*( Quatermass and the Pit was the last original production upon which Kneale )Tj
T*(collaborated with Rudolph Cartier, although Cartier did direct a new version of )Tj
T*(Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.[40] Other )Tj
T*(later successes for Cartier were Anna Karenina \(1961\) and Lee Oswald: Assassin )Tj

T*(2006.[44] Recalling the frightening qualities of the Quatermass serials in )Tj
T*(1981, journalist Geoffrey Wansell wrote that "when the third series, Quatermass )Tj
T*(and the Pit was shown, three of my school friends insisted on leaving the room )Tj
T*(whenever it started."[45] )Tj
T*( The Times's television reviewer praised the opening episode the day after its )Tj
T*(transmission. Pointing out that "Professor Bernard QuatermassÂ ... like all )Tj
T*(science fiction heroes, has to keep running hard if he is not to be overtaken )Tj
T*(by the world of fact,"[46] the anonymous reviewer went on to state how much he )Tj
T*(had enjoyed the episode. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(This expository episode was an excellent example of Mr. Kneale's ability to )Tj
T*(hold an audience with promises alone; smooth, leisurely, and without any )Tj
T*(sensational incident, it was imbued in Mr. Rudolph Cartier's production with )Tj
T*(unearthly echoes of horrors to come. Sharing them for the next six weeks with )Tj
T*(Mr. Andre Morell and Mr. Cec Linder is an unnerving prospect.[46])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Criticism of the serial was also expressed. Although Kneale would go on to use )Tj
T*(the Martian "Wild Hunt" as a deliberate allegory for the recent Notting Hill )Tj
T*(race riots,[47][48] some Black British leaders were upset with the depiction of )Tj
T*(racial tensions in the first episode. "Leaders of coloured minorities here )Tj
T*(to-day criticized the BBC for allowing a report that 'race riots are continuing )Tj
T*(in Birmingham,' to be included in a fictional news bulletin during the first )Tj
T*(instalment of the new Quatermass television play last night," reported The )Tj
T*(Times's Birmingham correspondent.[49] The report quoted Dr. W. C. Pilgrim of )Tj
T*(the city's West Indian community as saying, "I do not agree with this sort of )Tj
T*(thing, fiction or not. No trouble of this kind has happened in Birmingham, )Tj
T*(where our problems do not find expression in violence."[49] The BBC replied to )Tj
T*(the criticisms with the assurance that: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(This was a completely imaginary news bulletin in a fictional programme set in )Tj
T*(the indeterminate future that contained such items as a rocket landing on the )Tj
T*(moon. It was all Jules Verne sort of stuff. No slur on Birmingham was implied )Tj
T*(and no reference to past events nor prophecy of the future was intended.[49])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( These themes and subtexts were highlighted by the British Film Institute's )Tj
T*(review of the serial, when it was included in their "TV 100" list in 2000, in )Tj
T*(75th positionâ€”20th out of the dramas featured.[3] "In a story which mined )Tj
T*(mythology and folkloreÂ ... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes )Tj
T*(of man's hostile nature and the military's perversion of science for its own )Tj
T*(ends."[3] The theme of military takeover of peaceful scientific research was )Tj
T*(also praised and compared to the contemporary outlook by Patrick Stoddart, )Tj
T*(writing for The Sunday Times in 1988. )Tj

T*(Last week I watched a BBC drama in which a scientist fought against smirking )Tj
T*(government ministers and power-crazed army officers to stop his peaceful rocket )Tj
T*(research group being turned into a Star Wars vehicle to put missiles on the )Tj
T*(moon. They won. If you are wondering how you missed the ritual complaints which )Tj
T*(now follow every programme like this from offstage right, it is because the )Tj
T*(play was Quatermass and the Pit, which the BBC has just released on video. It )Tj
T*(was made in 1957, when the Macmillan government presumably believed that )Tj
T*(defence policy was a reasonable thing for the BBC to debate, even in drama. You )Tj
T*(seriously wonder how much internal angst would be generated if the BBC was )Tj
T*(offered the same plot now.[50])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The serial has also been an influence on other television science-fiction )Tj
T*(productions. Mark Gatiss wrote in The Guardian in 2006 that "What sci-fi piece )Tj
T*(of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?Â ... The "ancient invasion" )Tj
T*(of Quatermass and the Pit cast a huge shadowÂ ... its brilliant blending of )Tj
T*(superstition, witchcraft and ghosts into the story of a five-million-year-old )Tj
T*(Martian invasion is copper-bottomed genius."[51] Gatiss was a scriptwriter for )Tj
T*(Doctor Who, a programme that had been particularly strongly influenced by the )Tj
T*(Quatermass serials throughout its history.[52][53]Derrick Sherwin, the producer )Tj
T*(of Doctor Who in 1969, acknowledged Quatermass and the Pit as an influence on )Tj
T*(changing the format of the programme. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(What the producers had been trying to doâ€”and what ultimately they achieved in )Tj
T*(Quatermass and the Pitâ€”was to get some reality into it. So I said that this was )Tj
T*(the solution: that what we had to do with Doctor Who was to forget wobbly )Tj
T*(jellies in outer space and create some reason for bringing the stories down to )Tj
T*(Earth.[54])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( More specifically, the 1971 &amp; 1977 Doctor Who serials The DÃ¦mons and Image )Tj
T*(of the Fendahl contain many very similar elements and themes to Quatermass and )Tj
T*(the Pit. Comparing The Pit to The Daemons, many people have noted the )Tj
T*(similarities between this story's plot and that of the 1958 BBC serial and 1967 )Tj
T*(Hammer film. Both involve the unearthing of an extraterrestrial spaceship, an )Tj
T*(alien race that has interfered with human evolution and is the basis for )Tj
T*(legends of devils, demons and witchcraft, and places with "devilish" names - )Tj
T*(Devil's End in The Daemons, and Hob's Lane in Pit. Similar themes also appear )Tj
T*(in Image of the Fendahl [55] which deals with beings, the Fendahl of the title, )Tj
T*(that after the destruction of their homeworld came to Earth and influenced the )Tj
T*(evolution of humans to possess psychic powers. When its "skull", marked with a )Tj
T*(pentagram, is discovered in an archaeological dig, it proceeds to take over the )Tj
T*(descendants of the engineered humans in an effort to colonise the Earth.[55] )Tj
T*( The writer and critic Kim Newman, speaking about Kneale's career in a 2003 )Tj
T*(television documentary, cited Quatermass and the Pit as perfecting "the notion )Tj
T*(of the science-fictional detective story".[56] Newman also discussed the )Tj
T*(programme as an influence on the horror fiction writer Stephen King, claiming )Tj
T*(that King had "more or less rewritten Quatermass and the Pit in The )Tj
T*(Tommyknockers".[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other media )Tj
T*( As with the previous two Quatermass serials, the rights to adapt Quatermass )Tj
T*(and the Pit for the cinema were purchased by Hammer Film Productions. Their )Tj
T*(adaptation of the serial was released with the same title as the original in )Tj
T*(1967, directed by Roy Ward Baker and scripted by Kneale.[57] Scottish actor )Tj
T*(Andrew Keir starred as Quatermass, becoming the role for which he was best )Tj
T*(remembered, being regarded particularly highly in comparison to the previous )Tj
T*(film Quatermass, Brian Donlevy.[58][59][60] The film, made in colour, is )Tj
T*(regarded by many commentators as a classic of the genre.[2][61][62] The film )Tj
T*(has been released in DVD and Blu-ray formats. In the United States the film was )Tj
T*(retitled Five Million Years to Earth.[57] )Tj
T*( A script book of Quatermass and the Pit was released by Penguin Books in April )Tj

T*(1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother Bryan Kneale.[7] In 1979 this was )Tj
T*(re-published by Arrow Books to coincide with the transmission of the fourth and )Tj
T*(final Quatermass serial on ITV; this edition featured a new introduction by )Tj
T*(Kneale.[7] The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation )Tj
T*(of Quatermass and the Pit in a quarry near Nottingham in August 1997.[28][53] )Tj
T*( The BBC made Quatermass and the Pit available to buy on VHS videotape in the )Tj
T*(1980s, edited into a two-part compilation format. This was a new compilation )Tj
T*(made from the episodic film recordings, which had optical sound and telecined )Tj
T*(film inserts; for unknown reasons the BBC chose not to master it from the )Tj
T*(existing 1959â€“60 compilation, which had magnetic sound and film inserts )Tj
T*(reinserted from the original shoot \(see information on box set remastering )Tj
T*(below\).[23] This version was re-released on VHS by budget label Paradox Video )Tj
T*(in 1995,[63] and later put out again, this time by Revelation Films, on )Tj
T*(DVD.[23] The full, unedited, episodic version of the serial was released on DVD )Tj
T*(by BBC Worldwide in 2005, as part of The Quatermass Collection box set. Also )Tj
T*(included were the existing first two episodes of The Quatermass Experiment, all )Tj
T*(of Quatermass II and various extra features.[4] )Tj
T*( For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was extensively restored.[4] A )Tj
T*(process called VidFIRE was applied to all of the scenes originally broadcast )Tj
T*(live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on )Tj
T*(transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process.[23] For the )Tj
T*(pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35Â mm film inserts still )Tj
T*(existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959â€“60 compilation repeat version )Tj
T*(in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences.[23] )Tj
T*(As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences )Tj
T*(were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly-restored )Tj
T*(episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic )Tj
T*(soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. )Tj
T*(This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the )Tj
T*(original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering )Tj
T*(except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few )Tj
T*(cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the )Tj
T*(optical versions.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Parodies )Tj
T*( A 1959 episode of The Goon Show, a BBC radio comedy series, parodied )Tj
T*(Quatermass and the Pit.[7] The episode, "The Scarlet Capsule", was written by )Tj
T*(Spike Milligan, and used the original BBC Radiophonic Workshop sound effects )Tj
T*(made for the television serial.[7] In the episode, some workmen employed by the )Tj
T*(government's Dig Up the Roads Plan for Congesting Traffic Scheme unearth an )Tj
T*(ancient skull \("Must be a womanÂ ... the mouth's open."\). Professor Ned )Tj
T*(Quartermess, a.k.a. Neddie Seagoon \(Harry Secombe\), sceptical of claims that )Tj
T*(the remains might be unexploded German skulls from World War II, discovers a )Tj
T*(fossilized Irish stew, and then uncovers a strange scarlet capsule containing )Tj
T*(the fossilized remains of three serge suits and the bones of a bowler hat. )Tj
T*(Willium "Mate" Cobblers hears a voice saying "Minardor". Several people are )Tj
T*(struck down by flying Irish stews, and Quartermess becomes convinced there is a )Tj
T*(poltergeist at work, and starts evacuating the local populationâ€”including Peter )Tj
T*(Sellers as a woman whose seductive voice causes the script \(according to )Tj
T*(announcer Wallace Greenslade\) to be heavily censored.[citation needed] )Tj
T*(Eventually the scheming Hercules Grytpype-Thynne \(Sellers\) persuades )Tj
T*(Quartermess to blow up the capsule â€” with his sidekick Count Jim Moriarty )Tj
T*(\(Milligan\), whose life he has coincidentally insured for a large sum, tied up )Tj
T*(inside. But the blast blows everyone up â€” at least until the next episode â€” and )Tj
T*(a BBC announcer \(Andrew Timothy\) reports that the capsule was actually a London )Tj
T*(Underground train containing three striking Tube workers that had been shunted )Tj
T*(into a siding and forgotten. "The Mystic word 'Minardor' was in fact 'Mind the )Tj
T*(doors'. Not a very good ending, but at least it's tidy, don't you think?" He is )Tj
T*(then struck down by an Irish stew \("And there's more where that came from, )Tj
T*(Tim!" remarks Major Bloodnok \(Sellers\) \). The episode has been released on )Tj

T*( [edit] Meteorological history )Tj
T*( Tropical Depression Ten formed from the complex interaction between an )Tj
T*(upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and the )Tj
T*(tail end of a cold front. By September 17, the system produced widespread )Tj
T*(thunderstorm activity over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean.[1] The )Tj
T*(upper-level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the )Tj
T*(area, and on September 18 the system began crossing Florida.[2] Initially very )Tj
T*(disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a )Tj
T*(weak low pressure area developing on September 19.[3] )Tj
T*( A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system on September 20 reported a )Tj
T*(well-defined low and strong wind gusts in squalls as the system tracked into )Tj
T*(the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, along with limited and disorganized )Tj
T*(thunderstorm activity.[4] Convection gradually became better organized, with a )Tj
T*(well-defined band in its eastern semicircle and intermittent thunderstorm )Tj
T*(activity near the center. Despite an overall disorganized structure, with a )Tj
T*(poorly defined circulation and an upper-level low aloft, the National Hurricane )Tj
T*(Center initiated advisories on Subtropical Depression Ten at 1500Â UTC on )Tj
T*(September 21 while it was located about 40Â miles \(60Â km\) south of St. Vincent )Tj
T*(Island, Florida, citing "the potential for additional development right along )Tj
T*(the coastline."[5] In post-analysis, it was classified a subtropical cyclone )Tj
T*(three hours earlier.[1] )Tj
T*( With a mid-level ridge to its northwest, the subtropical depression was )Tj
T*(anticipated to parallel the coastline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. )Tj
T*(As a result, it was forecast to attain winds of 45Â mph \(75Â km/h\) and move )Tj
T*(ashore along southern Mississippi.[5] The circulation became better defined as )Tj
T*(convection modestly increased over the center, and within six hours of its )Tj
T*(development the system transitioned into a tropical depression. The cyclone )Tj
T*(continued tracking northwestward,[6] making landfall around 0000Â UTC on )Tj
T*(September 22 near Fort Walton Beach, Florida with winds of 35Â mph \(55Â km/h\).[7] )Tj
T*(The cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland, and 3Â hours after it moved )Tj
T*(ashore the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the )Tj
T*(depression.[8] As the depression tracked into Alabama, it became increasingly )Tj

T*(on 27Â February 2009, it was the band's first record since How to Dismantle an )Tj
T*(Atomic Bomb \(2004\), marking the longest gap between studio albums of U2's )Tj

T*( U2 began work on the album in 2006 with record producer Rick Rubin but shelved )Tj
T*(most of the material from those sessions. From May 2007 to December 2008, the )Tj
T*(band collaborated with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who produced and co-wrote )Tj
T*(many of the new songs. Writing and recording took place in the United States, )Tj
T*(United Kingdom, Ireland and Morocco. The group intended to release No Line on )Tj

T*(the release because they wanted to continue writing. )Tj
T*( Prior to the album's release, U2 indicated that Eno's and Lanois' involvement, )Tj

T*(release, No Line on the Horizon received generally favourable reviews, although )Tj
T*(many critics noted that it was not as experimental as previously suggested. The )Tj
T*(album debuted at number one in 30 countries but did not sell as well as )Tj

T*(ultimately decided to end recording with Rubin; though the material from these )Tj
T*(sessions was shelved, the band expressed interest in revisiting it in the )Tj
T*(future.[5] They subsequently employed Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois as principal )Tj
T*(producers and co-writers. Steve Lillywhite was also brought in to produce a few )Tj
T*(tracks.[4][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois )Tj
T*( U2 began work with Eno and Lanois in May 2007.[7] Bono had accepted an )Tj
T*(invitation to the World Sacred Music Festival in Fez, Morocco, and he invited )Tj
T*(his bandmates, as well as Eno and Lanois, to attend.[8] They rented the riad of )Tj
T*(hotel Riad Yacout and turned it into a makeshift recording studio,[9][10][11] )Tj
T*(intending to create "future hymns"â€”songs that would be played forever.[8] )Tj
T*( The group spent two weeks in Fez, occasionally recording with an oud player )Tj
T*(and local percussionists.[7] Recording during the festival exposed the group to )Tj
T*(Hindu and Jewish music, Sufi singing and Joujouka drums. The exotic influences )Tj
T*(inspired them to pursue a more experimental sound.[8][10][12] Bassist Adam )Tj
T*(Clayton said the music they heard in Fez "had a primitivismÂ ... but there was )Tj
T*(an other-worldly feel, there was that connection with that Arabic scale."[8] )Tj
T*(Eno insisted that drummer Larry Mullen,Â Jr. use an electronic drum kit.[13] The )Tj
T*(band described many of the tracks conceived in these sessions as unsuitable for )Tj
T*(radio airplay or for playing live.[8] The open-air riad allowed the group to )Tj
T*(hear birdsong, as captured in the introduction to "Unknown Caller".[14] The )Tj
T*(songs "Moment of Surrender", "White as Snow", "No Line on the Horizon" and )Tj
T*("Unknown Caller" were written at this time; each track was recorded in one )Tj
T*(take.[11] In total, the band recorded approximately 10 songs during the two )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In pre-release interviews, U2 compared the extent of their expected shift in )Tj
T*(musical style to that of Achtung Baby.[13][18] The band scaled back these )Tj
T*(experimental pursuits, however; Mullen,Â Jr. noted, "at a certain stage, reality )Tj
T*(hits, and you go, 'What are we gonna do with this stuff?' Are we going to )Tj
T*(release this sort of meandering experimentation, or are we gonna knock some )Tj
T*(songs out of this?"[8] Bono shared this opinion, stating, "We went so far out )Tj
T*(on the Sufi singing and the sort of ecstatic-music front, that we had to ground )Tj
T*(it and find a counterpoint."[8] Eno commented that many of "the more )Tj
T*(contemplative and sonically adventurous songs" had been dropped, attributing )Tj
T*(the lack of African-inspired music to its sounding "synthetic" and unconvincing )Tj
T*(when paired with other songs.[4][17][19][20] )Tj
T*( Clayton filmed the band's progress during the album's production; these videos )Tj

T*(Tonight".[24] )Tj
T*( In December 2008, U2 recorded at Olympic Studios in London, putting the )Tj
T*(finishing touches to the album[10] and making several changes to its content. )Tj
T*(The group had planned to release the material as two extended plays, titled )Tj
T*(Daylight and Darkness, but during these sessions decided to compile the best )Tj
T*(songs onto one album.[25] The band struggled to complete "Stand Up Comedy", a )Tj
T*(song they had been working on since the Fez sessions 16 months previously. The )Tj
T*(song had been through multiple iterations and titles, including "For Your Love" )Tj
T*(and "Stand Up".[10] U2 cut "Winter", a song Eno had urged them to complete, and )Tj
T*("Every Breaking Wave", which they cut to reduce the album's running )Tj
T*(time.[8][26] "Winter" appears in the accompanying Anton Corbijn film Linear and )Tj
T*(the 2009 war film Brothers.[27][28] Both songs had been mentioned in )Tj
T*(pre-release album reviews.[10][24][29] )Tj
T*( The band changed many of the tracks' names during recording, retitling "French )Tj
T*(Disco" to "Magnificent" and "Crazy Tonight" to "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go )Tj
T*(Crazy Tonight". "Chromium Chords" became "Tripoli", and finally "FezÂ â€“ Being )Tj
T*(Born".[10][30][31] The band considered "FezÂ â€“ Being Born" and "Get on your )Tj
T*(Boots" as album openers, but ultimately decided on "No Line on the )Tj
T*(Horizon".[30][32] At the end of the sessions, the band chose to include "White )Tj
T*(as Snow", a quiet song about a dying soldier in Afghanistan, to balance out the )Tj
T*(earlier, rockier tunes.[26] With the exception of this track, U2 had tried to )Tj
T*(keep the theme of war out of the album.[33] In early December 2008, Clayton )Tj
T*(stated, "this is definitely the last week of recording. But then again, last )Tj
T*(week was definitely the last week of recording, and the week before that."[10] )Tj
T*(The final sessions ended later that month.[20]No Line on the Horizon is )Tj
T*(dedicated to Rob Partridge, who signed the band's first record deal in 1979 and )Tj
T*(died of cancer in late 2008.[33][34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Linear )Tj
T*( Linear, a film directed by Anton Corbijn, is included with the digipak, )Tj
T*(magazine, box, and deluxe iTunes editions of the album.[35][36][37] The idea )Tj
T*(for the film originated from a U2 video shoot in June 2007, during which )Tj
T*(Corbijn asked the band to remain still while he filmed them to create a )Tj
T*("photograph on film"; the band did not move but the objects around them )Tj
T*(did.[38] Impressed, the band believed that the online album listening )Tj
T*(experience could be enhanced with moving imagery. In May 2008, they )Tj
T*(commissioned Corbijn to create the film.[38] Corbijn has claimed that Linear is )Tj
T*(not a music video but "a new way to listen to a record" and "a new way to use )Tj
T*(film to connect to music".[39] )Tj
T*( The film is based on a story by Corbijn and Bono, and includes several of the )Tj
T*(characters Bono created for the album. The plot focuses on a Parisian )Tj
T*(motorcycle officer, played by SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui; the character has become )Tj
T*(disillusioned with his life and the conflict between immigrants and the police )Tj
T*(in the city, causing him to leave to see his girlfriend in Tripoli.[27][38] The )Tj
T*(song order in the film is representative of No Line on the Horizon's as it was )Tj
T*(in May 2008.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Following album )Tj
T*( In February 2009, Bono stated that by the end of the year U2 would release an )Tj
T*(album consisting of unused material from the No Line on the Horizon sessions. )Tj
T*(Bono labelled it "a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage".[10] )Tj

T*(that the album was almost complete, giving it a tentative release date of May )Tj

T*(answered in the negative, saying the band "felt that the next thing that people )Tj

T*( [edit] Composition )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( "... it's a very personal album. These are very personal stories even though )Tj
T*(they are written in character and, in a way, they couldn't be further from my )Tj
T*(own politics. But, in the sense of the peripheral vision, there's a world out )Tj
T*(there. As the old blues song goes, a world gone wrong. You can feel it just at )Tj
T*(the edgesâ€”the war in Iraq, the dark clouds on the horizon. But there is also a )Tj
T*(deliberate shutting out of that in order to focus on more personal epiphanies." )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( During the Hanover Quay sessions in 2008, Bono indicated that he had become )Tj
T*("tired of [writing in] the first-person", leading him to write songs from the )Tj
T*(perspective of different characters. He invented "a traffic cop, a junkie [and] )Tj
T*(a soldier serving in Afghanistan."[10] Although each character tells a personal )Tj
T*(story, the underlying theme of the album is peripheral vision, events taking )Tj
T*(place in the wider world, "just at the edges".[10] Bono described it as )Tj
T*("central to the understanding of this album".[10] Nevertheless, as the )Tj
T*(characters narrate there is an intentional "shutting out" of the wider world, )Tj
T*(so that the focus remains on their "personal epiphanies". The narrative the )Tj
T*(group originally planned for the album was broken up in the sessions' final )Tj
T*(weeks with their changes to the track listing.[10] In January 2008, Bono )Tj
T*(revealed that numbers were significant in many of the songs.[49] In February )Tj
T*(2009, he noted that the album was split into thirds; he described the first )Tj
T*(section as "a whole world unto itself, and you get to a very ecstatic place", )Tj
T*(and the second as "a load of singles". The final third is composed of songs )Tj
T*(that are "unusual territory" for the band.[50] )Tj
T*( "No Line on the Horizon" stemmed from Mullen's experiments with different drum )Tj
T*(beats; Eno sampled and manipulated the patterns, and the rest of the band began )Tj
T*(to play over the beats. The lyrical idea of a place "where the sea meets the )Tj
T*(sky and you can't tell the difference between the two" and the vocal delivery )Tj
T*(were both present from the start.[13] Bono noted that the theme behind the song )Tj
T*(was infinity, and that the track was inherently optimistic.[10] "Magnificent" )Tj
T*(is an up-tempo song that begins with a synthesizer line by Eno. The band wanted )Tj
T*(a track that felt euphoric, and the melody, created from a series of chord )Tj
T*(changes during a jam, was worked on continuously by Bono.[13][33] The setting )Tj
T*(in the lyrics was described by Lanois as "New York in the 50s", written from )Tj
T*(the perspective of "a Charlie Parker kind of figure".[13] The song has been )Tj
T*(described as "echo[ing] The Unforgettable Fire's opening track 'A Sort of )Tj
T*(Homecoming' in its atmospheric sweep".[24] )Tj
T*( The drug addict character appears in the songs "Moment of Surrender" and )Tj
T*("Unknown Caller". "Moment of Surrender", improvised and recorded by U2, Eno, )Tj
T*(and Lanois in a single take, demonstrates gospel influences. Eno and Lanois )Tj
T*(said the song is the closest to the group's original concept for an album of )Tj
T*(future hymns.[8] Eno noted, "Apart from some editing and the addition of the )Tj
T*(short cello piece that introduces it, the song appears on the album exactly as )Tj
T*(it was the first and only time we played it."[10] In the song, the addict is )Tj

T*(while using his phone to buy drugs, begins receiving cryptic text messages with )Tj
T*(technology-inspired directions.[33] The track was developed early in the Fez )Tj
T*(sessions. The guitar solo at the song's conclusion was taken from the backing )Tj
T*(track.[13] )Tj
T*( Eno developed "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight" during the Fez )Tj
T*(sessions, under the working title "Diorama".[13] U2 reworked it with Steve )Tj
T*(Lillywhite during a break from recording with Eno and Lanois.[13] Some of the )Tj
T*(lyrics were influenced by Barack Obama's presidential campaign, while others )Tj
T*(referenced Bono.[10] Album reviews described the song as a joyous pop rock )Tj
T*(composition. "Get on Your Boots" stemmed from a guitar riff The Edge created )Tj
T*(and recorded at his home.[13] At 150 beats per minute, the song is one of the )Tj
T*(fastest the band have recorded.[20]Rolling Stone called it a "blazing, )Tj
T*(fuzzed-out rocker that picks up where 'Vertigo' left off."[29] Thematically, )Tj
T*(the song is about Bono taking his family on vacation to France and witnessing )Tj
T*(warplanes flying overhead at the start of the Iraq War.[4] The chant "let me in )Tj
T*(the sound" was developed late in the recording sessions and became a theme )Tj
T*(throughout parts of the album.[13] )Tj
T*( "Stand Up Comedy" went through numerous iterations; at one point, Lanois )Tj
T*(noted, "that song was about six different songs".[13] In its original concept, )Tj
T*(the track featured mandolins playing in a Middle Eastern beat. The riff was )Tj
T*(altered and a chorus of "for your love" was introduced. This version was )Tj
T*(discarded as the band came up with a new riff and lyrics, only retaining the )Tj
T*("for your love" vocal.[8] U2 liked the result at the end of the sessions, but )Tj
T*(felt that the song would appear too "crafted"; they instead chose an older mix )Tj
T*(for inclusion on the album.[13] Several of the song's lyrics, including the )Tj
T*(line, "Be careful of small men with big ideas", relate to Bono's )Tj
T*(self-mockery.[10] The guitar sound from the experimental "Fez" portion of "FezÂ )Tj
T*(â€“ Being Born" was developed while the band recorded "The Saints Are Coming" )Tj
T*(during the Rick Rubin sessions.[33] Lanois edited the part, adding a beat )Tj
T*(developed by Eno, before playing it for the group. The sounds of a Moroccan )Tj
T*(marketplace were also added. The faster section of the song, "Being Born", was )Tj
T*(altered into the same key as "Fez" and Lanois placed the two sections together, )Tj
T*(creating the one song.[13] The "let me in the sound" chant from "Get on Your )Tj
T*(Boots" is included at the beginning of the track.[33] )Tj
T*( "White as Snow" focuses on the soldier character's last thoughts as he dies )Tj
T*(from the wounds suffered from an improvised explosive device.[4] The song is )Tj
T*(based on the traditional hymn "Veni, veni, Emmanuel"; the idea to base the song )Tj
T*(on a public domain melody was suggested to Lanois by Newfoundland musician Lori )Tj
T*(Anna Reid.[4] "Breathe" is set on 16Â June, an intentional reference to James )Tj
T*(Joyce's novel Ulysses.[8] U2 worked on an earlier version of the song for a )Tj
T*(long time before they scrapped it and re-recorded it with Lillywhite.[13] Two )Tj
T*(sets of lyrics were also present; one about Nelson Mandela, and the other "more )Tj
T*(surreal and personal".[8] The band decided to use the latter.[8] "Cedars of )Tj
T*(Lebanon", written from the perspective of a journalist covering a war overseas, )Tj
T*(was created in a similar manner to "FezÂ â€“ Being Born". The song's melody was )Tj
T*(based on a sample of "Against the Sky", a track Eno and Lanois had collaborated )Tj
T*(on with Harold Budd for the 1984 album The Pearl; the group noted that the )Tj
T*(ambience of the song was "like a direct throwback to the early 80s".[13][33] )Tj
T*(The final verse is a condemnation of the Iraq War.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Release )Tj
T*( At the music industry trade fair Midem in 2008, Paul McGuinness said No Line )Tj
T*(on the Horizon would be ready for release in October 2008.[51] Lanois )Tj
T*(corroborated that in June 2008, stating the album should be ready in 3â€“4 weeks. )Tj
T*(He said, "We're just finishing the vocals. Bono's in great form, singing )Tj

T*(career.[25] )Tj
T*( Universal Music Group took extreme measures to prevent the album from leaking, )Tj
T*(offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out )Tj
T*(review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, )Tj
T*(getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18Â )Tj
T*(February 2009, almost two weeks before the scheduled release date. The complete )Tj
T*(album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the )Tj
T*(accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the )Tj
T*(Internet.[52] U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, )Tj
T*("The one good thing about that is a lot of our fans have already given us their )Tj
T*(thumbs up. Even though it was fans getting it for free."[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cover art )Tj
T*( The cover art for No Line on the Horizon is a photograph of Lake Constance, )Tj
T*(taken by Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto; titled Boden Sea, it is one of )Tj
T*(200 pictures in his Seascapes collection.[54] The image was the inspiration for )Tj
T*(Bono's lyrics on the track "No Line on the Horizon".[54] Sugimoto and U2 struck )Tj
T*(a deal in which the band could use the photograph as the cover art and Sugimoto )Tj
T*(could use "No Line on the Horizon" in his future projects; Sugimoto's only )Tj
T*(stipulation was that no text could be placed on top of the image.[54] Original )Tj
T*(releases had an equals sign superimposed in the middle of the album cover, but )Tj
T*(later releases featured only the image.[55] )Tj
T*( Boden Sea had previously been used by Richard Chartier and Taylor Deupree for )Tj
T*(their 2006 album Specification.Fifteen. The album covers are similar, though No )Tj
T*(Line on the Horizon has a white border around the image, and )Tj
T*(Specification.Fifteen has a box at the top of the cover with the names of the )Tj
T*(artists and the album.[56] Deupree called U2's cover "nearly an exact rip-off" )Tj
T*(and stated that for the band to obtain the rights to the image it was "simply a )Tj
T*(phone call and a check."[54][57] Sugimoto refuted both of these claims, calling )Tj
T*(the use of the same photograph a coincidence and stating that no money was )Tj
T*(involved in the deal with U2.[54] )Tj
T*( [edit] Formats )Tj
T*( No Line on the Horizon was released in five physical formats, three of )Tj
T*(whichâ€”the digipak, magazine, and box formatsâ€”were limited editions.[35][58] The )Tj
T*(standard jewel case release contained a 24-page booklet.[35] The LP vinyl )Tj
T*(release was pressed on two black discs and contained a 16-page booklet.[35] The )Tj
T*(digipak release had a 36-page booklet and a poster, which was also included in )Tj
T*(the box release. A 60-page magazine was included in the magazine )Tj
T*(release.[35]Linear was a downloadable feature in the digipak and magazine )Tj
T*(formats, and was a bonus DVD in the box release, which also contained a 64-page )Tj
T*(hardcover book.[35] )Tj
T*( The album was made available for pre-order on the iTunes Store on 19Â January )Tj
T*(2009, the day "Get on Your Boots" premiered on radio. iTunes album pre-orders )Tj
T*(contained bonus tracks unavailable with any other version.[36] Digital versions )Tj
T*(were available from Amazon.com in MP3 format, and from U2.com in MP3 and FLAC )Tj

T*( [edit] Promotion and singles )Tj
T*( To promote No Line on the Horizon, U2 performed "Get on Your Boots" at the )Tj
T*(51st Grammy Awards, the 2009 BRIT Awards, and the 2009 Echo Awards, although )Tj
T*(the album was not eligible for awards at any of the ceremonies.[4][59][60] The )Tj

T*( No Line on the Horizon received generally favourable reviews. At Metacritic, )Tj
T*(which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream )Tj
T*(critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 30 reviews, three )Tj
T*(of which gave it a perfect score.[73]David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave a )Tj
T*(perfect score of five stars, labelling it "[U2's] best, in its textural )Tj
T*(exploration and tenacious melodic grip, since 1991's Achtung Baby."[79]Blender )Tj
T*(and Q also gave it a perfect score.[75][78] In his review for Blender, Rob )Tj
T*(Sheffield stated "The days are gone when U2 were trying to keep it simpleâ€”at )Tj
T*(this point, the lads have realized that over-the-top romantic grandiosity is )Tj
T*(the style that suits them, so they come on like the cosmic guitar supplicants )Tj
T*(they were born to be."[75]Mojo and Uncut gave the album four stars; Uncut )Tj
T*(reviewer Andrew Mueller commented, "It's U2's least immediate albumâ€”but there's )Tj
T*(something about it that suggests it may be one of their most enduring."[76][83] )Tj
T*(Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded it Aâˆ’ and called the album "an )Tj
T*(eclectic and electrifying winner, one that speaks to the zeitgeist the way only )Tj
T*(U2 can and dare to do."[84] BBC Music reviewer Chris Jones said, "There's )Tj
T*(plenty to rejoice about here" while noting that the "symbiotic relationship )Tj
T*(with Brian Eno \(and Daniel Lanois\) seems to have reached the point of )Tj
T*(imperceptibility."[85]NME contributor Ben Patashnik rated the album seven out )Tj
T*(of ten, calling it "a grand, sweeping, brave record that, while not quite the )Tj
T*(reinvention they pegged it as, suggests they've got the chops to retain their )Tj
T*(relevance well into their fourth decade as a band."[19] )Tj
T*( Time Out Sydney gave No Line on the Horizon two stars out of five, stating, )Tj
T*("U2 return with a new album. Sadly, it's Brian Eno'sÂ ... for all that's new, )Tj
T*(there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band."[81]Pitchfork Media )Tj
T*(reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, "the album's )Tj
T*(ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a )Tj
T*(wash of shameless U2-isms."[86] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating )Tj
T*(of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and )Tj
T*(Original Soundtracks 1 while stating "This is no blockbusterÂ ... It's the least )Tj
T*(immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living )Tj
T*(with".[87] Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia also gave the album seven out of ten, )Tj
T*(concluding that "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant )Tj
T*(reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [No Line on the )Tj
T*(Horizon] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the )Tj

T*( [edit] Commercial performance )Tj
T*( No Line on the Horizon opened with strong sales, although these quickly )Tj
T*(declined. The album debuted at number one in thirty countries, including )Tj
T*(Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, )Tj
T*(the United Kingdom, and the United States.[90][91] By June 2009, over fiveÂ )Tj
T*(million copies had been sold worldwide.[92] Within one week of release, the )Tj
T*(album was certified platinum in Brazil, a record for the country.[93] In the )Tj
T*(United Kingdom, the album became U2's tenth number-one album, making them the )Tj
T*(fifth-most-successful act on the UK Albums Chart.[94] In the United States, it )Tj
T*(was U2's seventh number-one album; first-week sales exceeded 484,000, the )Tj
T*(band's second-highest figures after How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.[90] By )Tj
T*(October 2009, sales in the US had exceeded just over oneÂ million copies, the )Tj
T*(group's lowest in more than a decade.[95] Global sales of the album remained at )Tj
T*(fiveÂ million copies through September 2010.[96] )Tj
T*( Eight months after No Line on the Horizon's release, Bono said he was )Tj
T*(disappointed with the album's sales.[97] In the UK, it sold less than a third )Tj
T*(of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb's figuresâ€”a quarter of All That You Can't )Tj
T*(Leave Behind'sâ€”and it did not generate a hit single.[97]ABC noted that sales of )Tj
T*(How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb had been propelled by the track "Vertigo" )Tj
T*(which, although not a chart success, had become well-known to the public from )Tj
T*(its use in iPod commercials.[98] Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono )Tj
T*(said, "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an )Tj
T*(extinct species, and we [tried to] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, )Tj
T*(middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging )Tj
T*(for people who have grown up on a diet of pop stars."[97] Clayton agreed that )Tj
T*(the album's commercial reception must be "challenged" but said, "the more )Tj
T*(interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' )Tj
T*(Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fanâ€”the concept of the person )Tj
T*(who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itselfâ€”is an )Tj
T*(outdated idea."[95] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No )Tj
T*(Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time.[97] He noted that the )Tj
T*(reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was )Tj
T*(connecting with the fans, adding, "There's a lot of records that make great )Tj
T*(first impressions. There might be one song that gets to be big on the radio, )Tj
T*(but they're not albums that peopleÂ ... play a lot. This is one that I gather )Tj
T*(from talking to people.Â ... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really )Tj
T*(getting into the album now.'"[99] Lillywhite believed that the African )Tj
T*(influence had not translated well onto the album, remarking "It's a pity )Tj
T*(because the whole idea of Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea )Tj
T*(for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the )Tj
T*(spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that )Tj
T*(meant it did not come across on the record."[100] McGuinness believed that the )Tj
T*(conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any )Tj
T*(decline in U2's popularity.[101] Despite the comparatively low sales, globally )Tj
T*(it was the seventh-highest-selling album of 2009.[102] )Tj

T*( [edit] U2 360Â° Tour )Tj
T*( Following the release of No Line on the Horizon, U2 staged a worldwide stadium )Tj
T*(tour, titled the U2 360Â° Tour. Beginning on 30Â June 2009 in Barcelona, the tour )Tj
T*(visited Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa and South America from 2009 to )Tj
T*(2011.[107][108] The concerts featured a 360-degree stage that the audience )Tj
T*(surrounded.[109] To accommodate this, a large four-legged structure nicknamed )Tj
T*("The Claw" was built above the stage. At 50Â meters \(165Â feet\) tall, it was the )Tj
T*(largest stage ever constructed and twice the size of the previous largest set, )Tj
T*(which was used on The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour.[110] The idea for the )Tj
T*(stage had been proposed to the group by the set designer Willie Williams at the )Tj
T*(end of the Vertigo Tour in 2006.[110] The design was intended to overcome the )Tj
T*(staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated )Tj
T*(by speaker stacks on either side.[111] By the conclusion of the second leg, the )Tj
T*(tour had grossed over US$311Â million from 44Â shows, making it the )Tj
T*(highest-grossing tour of the year;[112] despite this, the high production )Tj
T*(costs, approximately US$750,000 per day,[113] meant the tour was barely )Tj
T*(breaking even.[114] In 2011, the U2 360Â° Tour became the highest-grossing )Tj
T*(concert tour, with ticket sales totaling over US$736 million.[115] )Tj
T*( During the first leg of the tour in Europe, the band typically played songs )Tj
T*(from No Line on the Horizon early in the set. "Breathe", "No Line on the )Tj
T*(Horizon", "Get on Your Boots" and "Magnificent" were played as the opening )Tj
T*(quartet, while "Unknown Caller" and a remixed arrangement of "I'll Go Crazy If )Tj
T*(I Don't Go Crazy Tonight" appeared close to the halfway point. "Moment of )Tj
T*(Surrender" closed every show.[116] U2 made minor changes to the setlists for )Tj
T*(the second leg of the tour. "No Line on the Horizon" was performed later in the )Tj
T*(concerts, while "Unknown Caller" was dropped for several weeks before being )Tj
T*(revived towards the end of the leg. The band did not play "Stand Up Comedy", )Tj
T*("FezÂ â€“ Being Born", "White as Snow", or "Cedars of Lebanon" at any point in )Tj
T*(2009.[116] The 25Â October 2009 concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, )Tj
T*(California, U2's penultimate concert of 2009,[116] was filmed and streamed live )Tj
T*(over YouTube.[117] The shoot used 27Â high definition cameras; the concert was )Tj
T*(released on DVD and Blu-ray as U2 360Â° at the Rose Bowl on 3Â June 2010.[118] )Tj
T*("Get on Your Boots", "Magnificent", "No Line on the Horizon", "Unknown Caller", )Tj
T*("I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight", and "Moment of Surrender" are on )Tj

T*( John Calvin Coolidge, Jr. \(July 4, 1872Â â€“ January 5, 1933\) was the 30th )Tj
T*(President of the United States \(1923â€“1929\). A Republican lawyer from Vermont, )Tj
T*(Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, )Tj
T*(eventually becoming governor of that state. His conduct during the Boston )Tj
T*(Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a )Tj
T*(reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected as the 29th )Tj
T*(Vice President in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the sudden death of )Tj
T*(Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a )Tj
T*(reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a man who said very )Tj
T*(little. )Tj
T*( Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the scandals of )Tj
T*(his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable )Tj
T*(popularity.[1] As a Coolidge biographer put it, "He embodied the spirit and )Tj
T*(hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their )Tj
T*(opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most )Tj
T*(convincing proof of his strength."[2] Coolidge praised the achievement of )Tj
T*(widespread prosperity in 1928, saying: "The requirements of existence have )Tj
T*(passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury."[3] Some )Tj
T*(later criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of laissez-faire )Tj
T*(government.[4] His reputation underwent a renaissance during the Ronald Reagan )Tj
T*(Administration,[5] but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still )Tj
T*(divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government )Tj
T*(programs and those who believe the federal government should be more involved )Tj
T*(in regulating and controlling the economy.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Birth and family history )Tj
T*( John Calvin Coolidge, Jr., was born in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, )Tj
T*(Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. President to be born on Independence )Tj
T*(Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge, Sr. )Tj
T*(\(1845â€“1926\) and Victoria Josephine Moor \(1846â€“85\). Coolidge Senior engaged in )Tj
T*(many occupations, and ultimately enjoyed a statewide reputation as a prosperous )Tj
T*(farmer, storekeeper and public servant; he farmed, taught school, ran a local )Tj
T*(store, served in the Vermont House of Representatives and the Vermont Senate, )Tj
T*(and held various local offices including justice of the peace and tax )Tj
T*(collector.[7] Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer.[8] )Tj
T*(Coolidge's chronically ill mother died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when he was )Tj
T*(twelve years old. His sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge \(1875â€“90\), died at the age )Tj
T*(of fifteen, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father remarried in 1891, to )Tj
T*(a schoolteacher, and lived to the age of eighty. )Tj
T*( Coolidge's family had deep roots in New England. His earliest American )Tj
T*(ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, England, )Tj
T*(around 1630 and settled in Watertown, Massachusetts.[9] Another ancestor, )Tj
T*(Edmund Rice, arrived at Watertown in 1638.[10] Coolidge's )Tj
T*(great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military )Tj
T*(officer in the Revolutionary War and one of the first selectmen of the town of )Tj
T*(Plymouth Notch.[11] Most of Coolidge's ancestors were farmers. Other well-known )Tj
T*(Coolidges, architect Charles Allerton Coolidge, General Charles Austin )Tj
T*(Coolidge, and diplomat Archibald Cary Coolidge among them, were descended from )Tj
T*(branches of the family that had remained in Massachusetts.[9] Coolidge's )Tj

T*( Coolidge attended Black River Academy and then Amherst College, where he )Tj
T*(joined the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta.[14] At his father's urging, Coolidge )Tj
T*(moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, after graduating to take up the practice )Tj
T*(of law. Avoiding the costly alternative of attending a law school, Coolidge )Tj
T*(followed the more common practice of the time, apprenticing with a local law )Tj
T*(firm, Hammond &amp; Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry )Tj
T*(P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to the law practice in )Tj
T*(the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the bar, )Tj
T*(becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his )Tj
T*(grandfather, Coolidge was able to open his own law office in Northampton in )Tj
T*(1898. He practiced transactional law, believing that he served his clients best )Tj
T*(by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent )Tj
T*(attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his )Tj
T*(services.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Marriage and family )Tj
T*( In 1905, Coolidge met and married the daughter of a Vermont steamboat )Tj
T*(inspector,[16]Grace Anna Goodhue, who was working as a teacher at the Clarke )Tj
T*(School for the Deaf. While Grace was watering flowers outside the school one )Tj
T*(day in 1903, she happened to look up at the open window of Robert N. Weir's )Tj
T*(boardinghouse and caught a glimpse of Calvin Coolidge shaving in front of a )Tj
T*(mirror with nothing on but long underwear and a hat.[17] Coolidge later )Tj
T*(explained that he wore the hat to keep his unruly red hair out of his eyes )Tj
T*(while shaving.[18] After a more formal introduction sometime later, the two )Tj
T*(were quickly attracted to each other.[17] They were married on October 4, 1905, )Tj
T*(in the parlor of her parents' home in Burlington, Vermont. )Tj
T*( They were opposites in personality: she was talkative and fun-loving, while he )Tj
T*(was quiet and serious.[19] Not long after their marriage, Coolidge handed her a )Tj
T*(bag with fifty-two pairs of socks in it, all of them full of holes. Grace's )Tj
T*(reply was "Did you marry me to darn your socks?" Without cracking a smile and )Tj
T*(with his usual seriousness, Calvin answered, "No, but I find it mighty )Tj
T*(handy."[20] They had two sons: John, born in 1906, and Calvin, Jr., born in )Tj
T*(1908.[21] The marriage was, by most accounts, a happy one.[22] As Coolidge )Tj
T*(wrote in his Autobiography, "We thought we were made for each other. For almost )Tj
T*(a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities, and I have rejoiced )Tj
T*(in her graces."[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Local political office )Tj
T*( [edit] City offices )Tj
T*( The Republican Party was dominant in New England in Coolidge's time, and he )Tj
T*(followed Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local )Tj
T*(politics.[24] Coolidge campaigned locally for Republican presidential candidate )Tj
T*(William McKinley in 1896, and the next year he was selected to be a member of )Tj
T*(the Republican City Committee.[25] In 1898, he won election to the City Council )Tj
T*(of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were )Tj
T*(elected.[25] The position offered no salary, but it gave Coolidge experience in )Tj
T*(the political world.[26] In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for )Tj
T*(City Solicitor, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a )Tj
T*(one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901.[27] This position gave Coolidge )Tj
T*(more experience as a lawyer, and paid a salary of $600.[27] In 1902, the city )Tj
T*(council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to an )Tj
T*(exclusively private practice.[28] Soon thereafter, however, the clerk of courts )Tj
T*(for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid )Tj
T*(well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he only remained at the job for )Tj
T*(one year.[28] The next year, 1904, Coolidge met with his only defeat before the )Tj

T*(of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he )Tj
T*(would govern, Coolidge replied "Might give me time!"[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] State legislator and mayor )Tj
T*( In 1906 the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the )Tj
T*(state House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent )Tj
T*(Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts )Tj
T*(General Court.[29] In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees )Tj
T*(and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a Progressive )Tj
T*(Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct )Tj
T*(election of Senators.[30] Throughout his time in Boston, Coolidge found himself )Tj
T*(allied primarily with the western Winthrop Murray Crane faction of the state )Tj
T*(Republican Party, as against the Henry Cabot Lodge-dominated eastern )Tj
T*(faction.[31] In 1907, he was elected to a second term. In the 1908 session, )Tj
T*(Coolidge was more outspoken, but he was still not one of the leaders in the )Tj
T*(legislature.[32] )Tj
T*( Instead of vying for another term in the State House, Coolidge returned home )Tj
T*(to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent )Tj
T*(Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by )Tj
T*(a vote of 1,597 to 1,409.[33] During his first term \(1910 to 1911\), he )Tj
T*(increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still )Tj
T*(managing to effect a slight tax decrease.[34] He was renominated in 1911, and )Tj
T*(defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.[35] )Tj
T*( In 1911, the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and )Tj
T*(encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session. He defeated his )Tj
T*(Democratic opponent by a large margin.[36] At the start of that term, Coolidge )Tj
T*(was selected to be chairman of a committee to arbitrate the "Bread and Roses" )Tj
T*(strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, )Tj
T*(Massachusetts.[37] After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' )Tj
T*(demands in a settlement the committee proposed.[38] The other major issue for )Tj
T*(Republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing, which )Tj
T*(favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William )Tj
T*(Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to )Tj
T*(leave the Republican party.[39] When the new Progressive Party declined to run )Tj
T*(a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his )Tj
T*(Democratic opponent by an increased margin.[39] )Tj
T*( The 1913 session was less eventful, and Coolidge's time was mostly spent on )Tj
T*(the railroad committee, of which he was the chairman.[40] Coolidge intended to )Tj
T*(retire after the 1913 session, as two terms were the norm, but when the )Tj
T*(President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for )Tj
T*(Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate in the hopes )Tj
T*(of being elected as its presiding officer.[41] Although Greenwood later decided )Tj
T*(to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated and Coolidge was elected, )Tj
T*(with Crane's help, as the President of a closely divided Senate.[42] After his )Tj
T*(election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a speech entitled Have Faith in )Tj
T*(Massachusetts, which summarized his philosophy of government. It was later )Tj
T*(published in a book, and frequently quoted.[43] )Tj
T*(Do the day's work. If it be to protect the rights of the weak, whoever objects, )Tj
T*(do it. If it be to help a powerful corporation better to serve the people, )Tj
T*(whatever the opposition, do that. Expect to be called a stand-patter, but don't )Tj
T*(be a stand-patter. Expect to be called a demagogue, but don't be a demagogue. )Tj
T*(Don't hesitate to be as revolutionary as science. Don't hesitate to be as )Tj
T*(reactionary as the multiplication table. Don't expect to build up the weak by )Tj
T*(pulling down the strong. Don't hurry to legislate. Give administration a chance )Tj
T*(to catch up with legislation.)Tj
T*(Have Faith in Massachusetts as delivered by Calvin Coolidge to the )Tj
T*(Massachusetts State Senate, 1914.[44])Tj
T*( Coolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its )Tj

T*(for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate )Tj

T*(by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected )Tj
T*(unanimously to be President of the Senate.[46] As the 1915 session ended, )Tj
T*(Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged )Tj
T*(him again to run for lieutenant governor. This time, he accepted their )Tj
T*(advice.[47] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lieutenant Governor )Tj
T*( Coolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was )Tj
T*(nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W. McCall. Coolidge )Tj
T*(was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and balanced the )Tj
T*(Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of )Tj
T*(support.[48] McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election, with Coolidge defeating )Tj
T*(his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.[49] )Tj
T*( Coolidge's duties as lieutenant governor were few; in Massachusetts, the )Tj
T*(lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, although Coolidge )Tj
T*(did become an ex officio member of the governor's cabinet.[50] As a full-time )Tj
T*(elected official, Coolidge no longer practiced law after 1916, though his )Tj
T*(family continued to live in Northampton.[51] McCall and Coolidge were both )Tj
T*(reelected in 1916 and again in 1917 \(At the time, both offices were held for )Tj
T*(one-year terms\). When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, )Tj
T*(Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.[52] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governor of Massachusetts )Tj
T*( [edit] 1918 election )Tj
T*( Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of )Tj
T*(Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer )Tj
T*(and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous )Tj
T*(administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to )Tj
T*(Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement )Tj
T*(in World War I.[53] The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among )Tj
T*(Irish- and German-Americans.[54] Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 )Tj
T*(votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of )Tj
T*(any of his state-wide campaigns.[55] )Tj
T*( [edit] Boston police strike )Tj
T*( In 1919, in response to rumors that policemen of the Boston Police Department )Tj
T*(planned to form a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis issued a statement )Tj
T*(saying that such a move would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the )Tj
T*(American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union.[56] )Tj
T*(Curtis said the union's leaders were insubordinate and planned to relieve them )Tj
T*(of duty, but he said that he would suspend the sentence if the union was )Tj
T*(dissolved by September 4.[57] The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced )Tj
T*(Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but Curtis ultimately suspended the )Tj
T*(union leaders on September 8.[58] )Tj
T*("Your assertion that the Commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of )Tj
T*(leaving the city unguarded. That furnished the opportunity; the criminal )Tj
T*(element furnished the action. There is no right to strike against the public )Tj
T*(safety by anyone, anywhere, any time. ... I am equally determined to defend the )Tj
T*(sovereignty of Massachusetts and to maintain the authority and jurisdiction )Tj
T*(over her public officers where it has been placed by the Constitution and laws )Tj
T*(of her people." \(emphasis added\))Tj
T*(Telegram from Governor Calvin Coolidge to Samuel Gompers September 14, 1919.[59])Tj
T*( The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on )Tj
T*(strike.{{Refn group = "lower-alpha" | The exact total was 1,117 out of )Tj
T*(1,544[60] Coolidge had observed the situation throughout the conflict, but he )Tj
T*(had not yet intervened. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence )Tj
T*(and rioting in the lawless city.[61] Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes, )Tj
T*(had called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the )Tj
T*(Boston area and relieved Curtis of duty.[62] Coolidge, furious that the mayor )Tj
T*(had called out state guard units, finally acted.[63] He called up more units of )Tj
T*(the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the )Tj
T*(police force.[64] Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from )Tj
T*(their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.[65] )Tj

T*( That night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. )Tj
T*("Whatever disorder has occurred", Gompers wrote, "is due to Curtis's order in )Tj
T*(which the right of the policemen has been deniedâ€¦"[66] Coolidge publicly )Tj
T*(answered Gompers's telegram with the response that would launch him into the )Tj
T*(national consciousness \(quoted, above left\).[66] Newspapers across the nation )Tj
T*(picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of )Tj
T*(the strike. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified )Tj
T*(of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in )Tj
T*(Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among )Tj
T*(organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. )Tj
T*(Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him )Tj
T*(a national reputation as a man who would take decisive action. )Tj
T*( [edit] 1919 election )Tj
T*( Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By )Tj
T*(this time Coolidge's supporters \(especially Stearns\) had publicized his actions )Tj
T*(in the Police Strike around the state and the nation and some of Coolidge's )Tj
T*(speeches were published in book form.[43] He faced the same opponent as in )Tj
T*(1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more )Tj
T*(than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier.[67] His actions in )Tj
T*(the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to )Tj
T*(suggestions that Coolidge run for President in 1920.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legislation and vetoes as governor )Tj
T*( By the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War )Tj
T*(had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus to )Tj
T*(Massachusetts veterans. He also signed a bill reducing the work week for women )Tj
T*(and children from fifty-four hours to forty-eight, saying, "We must humanize )Tj
T*(the industry, or the system will break down."[69] He signed into law a budget )Tj
T*(that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming four million dollars from )Tj
T*(expenditures, thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt.[70] )Tj
T*( Coolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor. His most publicized veto was )Tj
T*(of a bill that would have increased legislators' pay by 50%.[71] Although )Tj
T*(Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 )Tj
T*(that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in )Tj
T*(Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States )Tj
T*(Constitution. "Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution," he )Tj
T*(said in his veto message, "Against it, they are void."[72] )Tj
T*( [edit] Vice Presidency )Tj
T*( [edit] 1920 election )Tj
T*( At the 1920 Republican National Convention most of the delegates were selected )Tj
T*(by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among )Tj
T*(many local favorites.[73] Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed )Tj
T*(as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses never considered him )Tj
T*(a serious candidate. After ten ballots, the delegates settled on Senator Warren )Tj
T*(G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for President.[74] When the time came to )Tj
T*(select a Vice Presidential nominee, the party bosses had also made a decision )Tj
T*(on who they would nominate: Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin.[75] A delegate )Tj
T*(from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, )Tj
T*(proposed Coolidge for Vice President instead.[75] The suggestion caught on )Tj
T*(quickly, and Coolidge found himself unexpectedly nominated.[76] )Tj
T*( The Democrats nominated another Ohioan, James M. Cox, for President and the )Tj
T*(Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for Vice President. The )Tj
T*(question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue )Tj
T*(in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism.[77] Harding ran )Tj
T*(a "front-porch" campaign from his home in Marion, Ohio, but Coolidge took to )Tj
T*(the campaign trail in the Upper South, New York, and New England.[78] On )Tj
T*(November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning )Tj

T*(Vice President to do so.[80] He gave speeches around the country, but none were )Tj
T*(especially noteworthy.[81] )Tj
T*( As Vice-President, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite )Tj
T*(a few parties, where the legend of "Silent Cal" was born. It is from this time )Tj
T*(that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate. Although )Tj
T*(Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he )Tj
T*(was a man of few words and was therefore commonly referred to as "Silent Cal." )Tj
T*(A possibly apocryphal story has it that Dorothy Parker, seated next to him at a )Tj
T*(dinner, said to him, "Mr. Coolidge, I've made a bet against a fellow who said )Tj
T*(it was impossible to get more than two words out of you." His famous reply: )Tj
T*("You lose."[82] It was also Parker who, upon learning that Coolidge had died, )Tj
T*(reportedly remarked, "How can they tell?"[83] Coolidge often seemed )Tj
T*(uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued )Tj
T*(to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, "Got to eat )Tj
T*(somewhere."[84]Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored )Tj
T*(Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: "When he wished he were elsewhere, )Tj
T*(he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely )Tj
T*(as though he had been weaned on a pickle.[85] )Tj
T*( As President, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. "The words of a )Tj
T*(President have an enormous weight," he would later write, "and ought not to be )Tj
T*(used indiscriminately."[86] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, )Tj
T*(he cultivated it. "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a )Tj
T*(President," he once told Ethel Barrymore, "and I think I will go along with )Tj
T*(them."[87] However, he did hold a then-record number of presidential press )Tj
T*(conferences, 520 during his presidency.[88] Some historians would later suggest )Tj
T*(that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic,[89] while )Tj
T*(others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after )Tj
T*(the death of his son in 1924.[90]  )Tj
T*( [edit] Presidency 1923â€“1929 )Tj
T*( [edit] Succession to the Presidency )Tj
T*( On August 2, 1923, President Harding died suddenly while on a speaking tour of )Tj
T*(the western United States.[91] Vice-President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting )Tj
T*(his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he )Tj
T*(received word by messenger of Harding's death.[92] Coolidge dressed, said a )Tj
T*(prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled.[92] His )Tj
T*(father, a notary public, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor )Tj
T*(by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47Â am on August 3, 1923; Coolidge then )Tj
T*(went back to bed. He returned to Washington the next day, and was re-sworn in )Tj
T*(by Justice Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the Supreme Court of the District of )Tj
T*(Columbia, as there was some confusion over whether a state notary public had )Tj
T*(the authority to administer the presidential oath.[93][94] )Tj
T*( [edit] Finishing Harding's term )Tj
T*( The nation did not know what to make of its new President; Coolidge had not )Tj
T*(stood out in the Harding administration and many had expected him to be )Tj
T*(replaced on the ballot in 1924.[95] He appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia )Tj
T*(Congressman and experienced federal politician[96] to work jointly with Edward )Tj
T*(T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice )Tj
T*(presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President \(a position equivalent to )Tj
T*(the modern White House Chief of Staff\).[97] Although a few of Harding's cabinet )Tj
T*(appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge announced that he would not demand any )Tj
T*(of their resignations, believing that since the people had elected Harding, he )Tj
T*(should carry on Harding's presidency, at least until the next election.[97] )Tj
T*( He addressed Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, giving a speech )Tj
T*(that echoed many of Harding's themes, including immigration restriction and the )Tj
T*(need for the government to arbitrate the coal strikes then ongoing in )Tj
T*(Pennsylvania.[98] Coolidge's speech was the first Presidential speech to be )Tj
T*(broadcast to the nation over the radio.[99] The Washington Naval Treaty was )Tj

T*(Compensation Act or "Bonus Bill" was passed over his veto.[100] Coolidge signed )Tj
T*(the Immigration Act later that year, which was aimed at restricting southern )Tj
T*(and eastern European immigration, though he appended a signing statement )Tj
T*(expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of Japanese )Tj
T*(immigrants.[101] Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed )Tj
T*(into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which decreased personal income tax rates )Tj
T*(while increasing the estate tax, and creating a gift tax to reinforce the )Tj
T*(transfer tax system.[102] )Tj
T*( [edit] 1924 election )Tj
T*( The Republican Convention was held from June 10â€“12, 1924 in Cleveland, Ohio; )Tj
T*(President Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot.[103] The convention )Tj
T*(nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for Vice President on the second ballot, but )Tj
T*(he declined by telegram.[104] Former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes, who )Tj
T*(would win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925, was nominated on the third ballot; he )Tj
T*(accepted.[104] )Tj
T*( The Democrats held their convention from June 24 to July 9 in New York City. )Tj
T*(The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally )Tj
T*(agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan )Tj
T*(nominated for Vice President. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. )Tj
T*(La Follette, Sr., a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, split from his party to )Tj
T*(form a new Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican )Tj
T*(party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the Presidency.[105] )Tj
T*( Shortly after the conventions Coolidge experienced a personal tragedy. )Tj
T*(Coolidge's younger son, Calvin, Jr., developed a blister from playing tennis on )Tj
T*(the White House courts. The blister became infected, and within days Calvin, )Tj
T*(Jr. developed sepsis and died. After that Coolidge became withdrawn. He later )Tj
T*(said that "when he died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with )Tj
T*(him."[106] In spite of his sadness, Coolidge ran his conventional campaign; he )Tj
T*(never maligned his opponents \(or even mentioned them by name\) and delivered )Tj
T*(speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast )Tj
T*(over radio.[107] It was easily the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly )Tj
T*(because the President was grieving for his son, but partly because Coolidge's )Tj
T*(style was naturally non-confrontational.[108] The other candidates campaigned )Tj
T*(in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the )Tj
T*(results were very similar to those of 1920. Coolidge and Dawes won every state )Tj
T*(outside the South except for Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. Coolidge had )Tj

T*(economic growth known as the "Roaring Twenties". He left the administration's )Tj
T*(industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, Herbert )Tj
T*(Hoover, who energetically used government auspices to promote business )Tj
T*(efficiency and develop airlines and radio.[111] With the exception of favoring )Tj
T*(increased tariffs, Coolidge disdained regulation, and carried about this belief )Tj
T*(by appointing commissioners to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate )Tj
T*(Commerce Commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses )Tj
T*(under their jurisdiction.[112] The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one )Tj
T*(biographer described it, "thin to the point of invisibility."[113] )Tj

T*(Robert Sobel offers some context based on Coolidge's sense of federalism: "As )Tj
T*(Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, )Tj
T*(opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored )Tj
T*(safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate )Tj
T*(boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the )Tj
T*(1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local )Tj
T*(governments."[115] )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxation )Tj
T*( Coolidge's taxation policy was that of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew )Tj
T*(Mellon: taxes should be lower and fewer people should have to pay them.[116] )Tj
T*(Congress agreed, and the taxes were reduced in Coolidge's term.[116] In )Tj
T*(addition to these tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal )Tj
T*(expenditures and retiring some of the federal debt.[116] Coolidge's ideas were )Tj
T*(shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924 Congress passed the Revenue )Tj
T*(Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation )Tj
T*(for some two million people.[116] They reduced taxes again by passing the )Tj
T*(Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down )Tj
T*(so as to reduce the overall federal debt.[117] By 1927, only the richest 2% of )Tj
T*(taxpayers paid any federal income tax.[117] Although federal spending remained )Tj
T*(flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt )Tj
T*(to be retired, state and local governments saw considerable growth, surpassing )Tj
T*(the federal budget in 1927.[118] )Tj
T*( [edit] Farm subsidies )Tj
T*( Perhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was that of relief )Tj
T*(for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling )Tj
T*(agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to )Tj
T*(sell abroad at lowered prices.[119] Agriculture Secretary Henry C. Wallace and )Tj
T*(other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, )Tj
T*(but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and )Tj
T*(it was defeated just before the elections that year.[120] In 1926, with farm )Tj
T*(prices falling once more, Senator Charles L. McNary and Representative Gilbert )Tj
T*(N. Haugenâ€”both Republicansâ€”proposed the McNaryâ€“Haugen Farm Relief Bill. The )Tj
T*(bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in )Tj
T*(high-yield years and hold it \(when feasible\) for later sale, or sell it )Tj
T*(abroad.[121] Coolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, declaring that agriculture must )Tj
T*(stand "on an independent business basis," and said that "government control )Tj
T*(cannot be divorced from political control."[121] He favored instead Herbert )Tj
T*(Hoover's proposal to modernize agriculture to create profits, instead of )Tj
T*(manipulating prices. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the )Tj
T*(McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was )Tj
T*(defeated.[122] )Tj
T*( After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the )Tj
T*(Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to )Tj
T*(farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass.[122] In February )Tj
T*(1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing )Tj
T*(it.[123] Coolidge vetoed it.[123] In his veto message, he expressed the belief )Tj
T*(that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefitting only exporters and )Tj
T*(expanding the federal bureaucracy.[124] Congress did not override the veto, but )Tj
T*(it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge )Tj
T*(vetoed it.[123] "Farmers never have made much money," said Coolidge, the )Tj
T*(Vermont farmer's son, "I do not believe we can do much about it."[125] )Tj
T*( [edit] Flood control )Tj
T*( Coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great )Tj
T*(Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast )Tj
T*(until Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[126] Although he did eventually name Secretary )Tj
T*(Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, Coolidge's lack of interest )Tj
T*(in federal flood control has been criticized.[126] Coolidge did not believe )Tj
T*(that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, )Tj
T*(but it would be seen only as political grandstanding. He also did not want to )Tj
T*(incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed )Tj

T*(property owners should bear much of the cost.[127] On the other hand, Congress )Tj
T*(wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of )Tj
T*(flood mitigation.[128] When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, )Tj
T*(Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May )Tj
T*(15.[129] )Tj
T*( [edit] Civil rights )Tj
T*( Coolidge spoke out in favor of the civil rights of African Americans and )Tj
T*(Catholics.[130] He appointed no known members of the Ku Klux Klan to office; )Tj
T*(indeed the Klan lost most of its influence during his term.[131] )Tj
T*( In 1924, Coolidge responded to a letter that claimed the United States was a )Tj
T*("white man's country": )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(....I was amazed to receive such a letter. During the war 500,000 colored men )Tj
T*(and boys were called up under the draft, not one of whom sought to evade it. )Tj
T*([As president, I am] one who feels a responsibility for living up to the )Tj
T*(traditions and maintaining the principles of the Republican Party. Our )Tj
T*(Constitution guarantees equal rights to all our citizens, without )Tj
T*(discrimination on account of race or color. I have taken my oath to support )Tj
T*(that Constitution....[132])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted )Tj
T*(full U.S. citizenship to all American Indians, while permitting them to retain )Tj
T*(tribal land and cultural rights. However, the act was unclear on whether the )Tj
T*(federal government or the tribal leaders retained tribal sovereignty.[133] )Tj
T*(Coolidge repeatedly called for anti-lynching laws to be enacted, but most )Tj
T*(Congressional attempts to pass this legislation were filibustered by Southern )Tj
T*(Democrats. Coolidge appointed some African Americans to federal office. He )Tj
T*(retained Harding's choice of Walter L. Cohen of New Orleans, Louisiana, as the )Tj
T*(comptroller of customs and offered Cohen the post of minister to Liberia, which )Tj
T*(the businessman declined.[134] )Tj
T*( [edit] Foreign policy )Tj
T*( Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was reluctant to enter into foreign )Tj
T*(alliances.[135] Coolidge saw the landslide Republican victory of 1920 as a )Tj
T*(rejection of the Wilsonian idea that the United States should join the League )Tj
T*(of Nations.[136] While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed )Tj
T*(the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did )Tj
T*(not advocate membership in it.[136] He spoke in favor of the United States )Tj
T*(joining the Permanent Court of International Justice, provided that the nation )Tj
T*(would not be bound by advisory decisions.[137] The Senate eventually approved )Tj
T*(joining the Court \(with reservations\) in 1926.[138] The League of Nations )Tj
T*(accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of their )Tj
T*(own.[139] The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World )Tj
T*(Court.[139] )Tj
T*( Coolidge's best-known initiative was the Kelloggâ€“Briand Pact of 1928, named )Tj
T*(for Coolidge's Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, and French foreign )Tj
T*(minister Aristide Briand. The treaty, ratified in 1929, committed signatories )Tj
T*(including the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan to )Tj
T*("renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one )Tj
T*(another."[140] The treaty did not achieve its intended resultÂ â€“ the outlawry of )Tj
T*(warÂ â€“ , but it did provide the founding principle for international law after )Tj
T*(World War II.[141] )Tj
T*( Coolidge continued the previous administration's policy not to recognize the )Tj
T*(Soviet Union.[142] He also continued the United States' support for the elected )Tj
T*(government of Mexico against the rebels there, lifting the arms embargo on that )Tj
T*(country.[143] He sent his close friend Dwight Morrow to Mexico as the American )Tj
T*(ambassador.[144] Coolidge represented the U.S. at the Pan American Conference )Tj
T*(in Havana, Cuba, making him the only sitting U.S. President to visit the )Tj
T*(country. The United States' occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under )Tj
T*(his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American troops from the Dominican )Tj
T*(Republic in 1924.[145]  )Tj

T*( [edit] 1928 election )Tj
T*( In the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, )Tj
T*(where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended rodeos. He )Tj
T*(made Custer State Park his "summer White House". News coverage of Coolidge's )Tj
T*(time in the Black Hills soon increased tourism in the general region and )Tj
T*(promoted the popularity of Wind Cave National Park.[146] While on vacation, )Tj
T*(Coolidge surprisingly issued his terse statement that he would not seek a )Tj
T*(second full term as President in 1928: "I do not choose to run for President in )Tj
T*(1928."[147] After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. )Tj
T*("If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933Â â€¦ Ten years in )Tj
T*(Washington is longer than any other man has had itâ€”too long!"[148] In his )Tj
T*(memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: "The Presidential office )Tj
T*(takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While )Tj
T*(we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is )Tj
T*(hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish."[149] )Tj
T*(After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his )Tj
T*(memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of )Tj
T*(Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. )Tj
T*( Coolidge had been reluctant to choose Hoover as his successor; on one occasion )Tj
T*(he remarked that "for six years that man has given me unsolicited adviceâ€”all of )Tj
T*(it bad."[150] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly )Tj
T*(opposing the popular Commerce Secretary's nomination.[151] The delegates did )Tj
T*(consider nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover's running mate. )Tj
T*(But Coolidge \(who hated Dawes\) remarked that this would be "a personal affront" )Tj
T*(to him, and the convention selected Senator Charles Curtis instead.[152] )Tj

T*( Coolidge appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, )Tj
T*(Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall )Tj
T*(Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of )Tj
T*(Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be Attorney General in 1924 )Tj
T*(to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. )Tj
T*(Daugherty. Coolidge named Stone to the Supreme Court in 1925.[153] Stone proved )Tj
T*(to be a firm believer in judicial restraint[154] and was regarded as one of the )Tj
T*(court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal )Tj
T*(legislation.[155] Stone was later appointed Chief Justice by President Franklin )Tj
T*(D. Roosevelt. )Tj
T*( [edit] Other courts )Tj
T*( Along with his Supreme Court appointment, Coolidge successfully nominated 17 )Tj
T*(judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 61 judges to the United )Tj
T*(States district courts. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as )Tj
T*(well, including Genevieve R. Cline, who became the first woman named to the )Tj
T*(Federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court )Tj
T*(in 1928.[156] Coolidge also signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law, allowing )Tj
T*(the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload. )Tj
T*( [edit] Retirement and death )Tj
T*( After his presidency, Coolidge retired to the modest rented house on )Tj
T*(residential Massasoit Street in Northampton before moving to a more spacious )Tj

T*(and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this )Tj
T*(period he also served as chairman of the non-partisan Railroad Commission, as )Tj
T*(honorary president of the American Foundation for the Blind, as a director of )Tj
T*(New York Life Insurance Company, as president of the American Antiquarian )Tj
T*(Society, and as a trustee of Amherst College.[157] Coolidge received an )Tj
T*(honorary Doctor of Laws from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. )Tj
T*( Coolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper )Tj
T*(column, "Calvin Coolidge Says," from 1930 to 1931.[158] Faced with looming )Tj
T*(defeat in 1932, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their )Tj
T*(party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former President )Tj
T*(made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would )Tj
T*(publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about.[159] Hoover )Tj
T*(was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of )Tj
T*(him.[160] )Tj
T*( He died suddenly of a heart attack at "The Beeches," at 12:45Â pm, January 5, )Tj
T*(1933.[161] Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: "I )Tj
T*(feel I no longer fit in with these times."[162] )Tj
T*( Coolidge is buried beneath a simple headstone in Notch Cemetery, Plymouth )Tj
T*(Notch, Vermont, where the family home is maintained as one of the original )Tj
T*(buildings on the site, all of which comprise the Calvin Coolidge Homestead )Tj

T*( [edit] Radio, film, and commemorations )Tj
T*( Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made )Tj
T*(use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while )Tj
T*(President. He made himself available to reporters, giving 529 press )Tj
T*(conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any President before or )Tj
T*(since.[164] )Tj
T*( Coolidge's inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on )Tj
T*(radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first President whose address to )Tj
T*(Congress was broadcast on radio.[165] On February 22, 1924, he became the first )Tj
T*(President of the United States to deliver a political speech on radio.[166] )Tj
T*(Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to )Tj
T*(the newly created Federal Radio Commission. )Tj
T*( On August 11, 1924, Lee De Forest filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn with )Tj

T*( "Rich Girl" is a song by American recording artist Gwen Stefani from her debut )Tj
T*(solo album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. \(2004\). Produced by Dr. Dre, the track )Tj
T*(features rapper Eve, and is a remake of Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One's 1993 )Tj
T*(song of the same name, which was in turn an adaptation of the Fiddler on the )Tj
T*(Roof song "If I Were a Rich Man". Stefani relates to the song stating it )Tj
T*(discusses her dreams of fame and riches from the perspective of "when she was )Tj
T*(just an Orange County girl".[1] )Tj
T*( The last song to be included on the album,[2] "Rich Girl" was released as the )Tj
T*(album's second single in late 2004 to mixed reviews from music critics. It was )Tj
T*(a commercial success, reaching the top ten on the majority of the charts it )Tj
T*(entered. In the United States, "Rich Girl" was certified gold, and it received )Tj
T*(a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Grammy Awards. )Tj
T*( [edit] Writing process )Tj
T*( Stefani and Eve had previously collaborated on the 2001 single "Let Me Blow Ya )Tj
T*(Mind". When Stefani first began recording solo material, Eve expressed interest )Tj
T*(in working with Stefani again, saying, "She's fly, she's tight and she is )Tj
T*(talented. It's going to be hot regardless."[3] The two decided to work together )Tj
T*(again after talking in Stefani's laundry room during a party.[2] After Stefani )Tj
T*(had co-written more than twenty songs for her solo debut, she approached Dr. )Tj
T*(Dre, who had produced for her twice before.[4] Dre had produced "Let Me Blow Ya )Tj
T*(Mind" as well as "Wicked Day", a track that was excluded from No Doubt's 2001 )Tj
T*(album Rock Steady.[5] )Tj
T*( After playing some of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told )Tj
T*(her, "You don't want to go back there." Instead of using one of the tracks, Dr. )Tj
T*(Dre instead suggested using English reggae duo Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One's )Tj
T*(1993 song "Rich Girl", which itself interpolated "If I Were a Rich Man" from )Tj
T*(the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof.[4] Stefani and Eve helped each other with )Tj
T*(their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to )Tj
T*(rewrite the song,[4] suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song.[2] )Tj
T*( Since she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to )Tj
T*(Broadway to better understand the theme that "even if you're poor and you have )Tj
T*(love, you're rich."[2] The idea which became the final version came to Stefani )Tj
T*(while brainstorming on her treadmill.[4] She commented that the troubles in )Tj
T*(writing the song came because "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new )Tj
T*(way", but when she presented him with the song, "he just totally tricked the )Tj
T*(track out."[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Music and structure )Tj
T*( "Rich Girl" is a ragga song composed in the key of C minor. It is written in )Tj
T*(common time and moves at a moderate 100 beats per minute.[7] The beat is )Tj
T*(accompanied by an alternating perfect fifth dyad and an accented piano )Tj
T*(trichord.[7][8] The song is written in verse-chorus form,[7] and its )Tj
T*(instrumentation includes the electronic keyboard, guitar, and keyboard bass.[9] )Tj
T*(Stefani's voice ranges from G3 to E5.[10] )Tj
T*( The introduction consists of the repeated use of the word na. Stefani reaches )Tj
T*(her highest note of the song, E5, as part of a trichord and her lowest, G3, )Tj
T*(during this section.[7] After the first chorus, Stefani discusses dreams of )Tj
T*(wealth and luxury,[11] and she namechecks fashion designers Vivienne Westwood )Tj
T*(and John Galliano. Stefani commented that the references were not product )Tj

T*(placement but that she included them "because I think they're rad and want to )Tj
T*(talk about them. [...] I'd give all my money to [Westwood] and buy all her )Tj
T*(clothes!"[12] A bridge, in which Stefani's voice is overdubbed, precedes the )Tj
T*(second chorus. During the second verse Stefani discusses her Harajuku Girls, )Tj
T*(and she then repeats the bridge. Following Eve's rap, Stefani sings the chorus )Tj
T*(and closes the song with a coda, which, like the introduction, consists of )Tj
T*(repeating the word na.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reception )Tj
T*( "Rich Girl" received mixed reviews from music critics. Richard Smirke of )Tj
T*(Playlouder said that it brought "a much-needed element of diversity" to )Tj
T*(L.A.M.B. and called it a "potential hit single".[13] Krissi Murison of the NME, )Tj
T*(however, described it as "playground chant featuring a tough-girl ragga cameo )Tj
T*(from Eve."[14] John Murphy from musicOMH gave it an overall positive review, )Tj
T*(calling it "a great fun song, and far superior to some of the dross that comes )Tj
T*(out these days", but also commented that it did not live up to "Let Me Blow Ya )Tj
T*(Mind" and found the references to the Harajuku Girls "slightly creepy."[15] )Tj
T*(Lisa Haines of BBC Music referred to the song as "disco gold, impossibly girly )Tj
T*(and very easy to dance to."[16] The song drew comparisons to the No Doubt album )Tj
T*(Rock Steady,[17] and Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine described it as "a lite )Tj
T*(version of 'Hey Baby.'"[18] )Tj
T*( Several reviewers found it ironic that Stefani, who had already sold )Tj
T*(twenty-six million records with No Doubt,[19] discussed having money in the )Tj
T*(counterfactual conditional. John Murphy from musicOMH found it "rather strange" )Tj
T*(for Stefani to sing the song while living off of royalties from No Doubt and )Tj
T*(her husband, post-grunge musician Gavin Rossdale.[20] Anthony Carew from Neumu )Tj
T*(called the lyrics "insipid" and noted that "the incredibly wealthy pop-starlet )Tj
T*(wonders what it'd be like to be, uh, incredibly wealthy".[21]The Orange County )Tj
T*(Register writer Ben Wener told Stefani that the song was disingenuous and )Tj
T*("absurd", to which Stefani responded that the point of view was from before she )Tj
T*(was famous.[1] Stefani later refused to issue credentials to the newspaper[1] )Tj
T*(after Wener wrote that "while posting a reported $90 million via her clothing )Tj
T*(lines [...] she's no more 'just an Orange County girl' than Best Buy is just a )Tj
T*(shack that sells Commodore 64s" in response to a track titled "Orange County )Tj
T*(Girl" from Stefani's second album The Sweet Escape.[22] )Tj
T*( The interpolation of "If I Were a Rich Man" drew mixed reviews. Jason Damas, )Tj
T*(writing for PopMatters, argued that the track "turns it into an anthem of urban )Tj
T*(bling-lust" and that its "simple pounding piano chord makes for great )Tj
T*(percussive backing."[8] Nick Sylvester from Pitchfork Media found the song )Tj
T*(corny, classifying it as "Eve- and Dre- and Tevye-powered camp-hop."[23]The )Tj
T*(Villager's Winnie MCCroy found the interpolation "innovative" and noted the )Tj
T*(song's take on "the current style of shout-out rap songs."[24]David Browne of )Tj
T*(Entertainment Weekly disagreed, stating that the interpolation was used )Tj
T*(awkwardly,[11] and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called the interpolation a )Tj
T*(goof.[25] Jason Shawhan from About.com called the track "a dancehall/classic )Tj
T*(house teardown of 'If I Were a Rich Man'" and added, "If this is what Jay-Z's )Tj
T*(fudging with Annie has wrought, I say, be glad of it."[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Chart performance )Tj
T*( "Rich Girl" performed well in North America. The single debuted at number )Tj
T*(seventy-four on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 25, 2004[27] and reached a )Tj
T*(peak position ten weeks later at number seven, remaining on the chart for over )Tj
T*(six months.[28] The song did well on pop-oriented charts, reaching number three )Tj
T*(on the Pop 100, number four on the Mainstream Top 40, and number sixteen on the )Tj
T*(Adult Top 40.[29] The single had little crossover success on the urban charts, )Tj
T*(only reaching number twenty-seven on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number )Tj
T*(seventy-eight on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.[29] "Rich Girl" was helped on )Tj
T*(the Hot 100 and Pop 100 charts by its strong digital downloads, peaking at )Tj
T*(number two on the Hot Digital Songs.[29] Due to its high number of digital )Tj
T*(downloads, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of )Tj
T*(America.[30] On the 2005 year-end chart, the single was listed at number )Tj
T*(thirty-one,[31] and at the 2006 Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for Best )Tj

T*(European Hot 100 Singles.[35] It reached the top five in Belgium, Denmark, )Tj
T*(France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden and the top ten in )Tj
T*(Austria, Finland, Italy, and Switzerland.[36] The song also charted highly in )Tj
T*(the UK, debuting at number four on March 20, 2005.[37] The track was unable to )Tj
T*(reach a higher position and remained on the chart for twelve weeks.[37] )Tj
T*( Elsewhere, "Rich Girl" peaked within the top twenty on the majority of the )Tj

T*( [edit] Music video )Tj
T*( The music video for "Rich Girl" was directed by David LaChapelle and features )Tj
T*(a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early '80s Vivienne Westwood )Tj
T*(advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy )Tj
T*(pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss )Tj
T*(what they would do if they were a "rich girl". The video features several )Tj
T*(sequences. Stefani is first shown below the deck of a pirate ship, dancing on a )Tj
T*(table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and wenches and is )Tj
T*(soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, )Tj
T*(the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, "I )Tj
T*(need the freaks on this one."[41] Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, )Tj
T*(and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing )Tj
T*(with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and )Tj
T*(swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the )Tj
T*(galleon engages in cannonfire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over )Tj
T*(the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked. )Tj
T*( The music video was a success on video channels. The video debuted at number )Tj
T*(nine on MTV's Total Request Live on December 13, 2004.[42] It worked its way to )Tj
T*(number five,[43] staying on the chart for a total of thirteen days.[42] The )Tj
T*(video also reached number four on MuchMusic's Countdown, remaining on the chart )Tj
T*(for sixteen weeks.[33]VH1 listed "Rich Girl" at number twenty-four on its Top )Tj
T*(40 Videos of 2005.[44] )Tj

T*(and Lady Macbeth. )Tj
T*( In the popular conscience, Leigh is greatly associated with her second )Tj
T*(husband, the equally highly-acclaimed Laurence Olivier, to whom she was )Tj
T*(married, with turbulent and scandalous effects, from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and )Tj
T*(Olivier starred together in many films and stage productions, often with )Tj
T*(Olivier as director. )Tj
T*( For much of her adult life Vivien Leigh suffered from bipolar disorder.[2] She )Tj
T*(earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and her career suffered )Tj
T*(periods of inactivity. She also suffered recurrent bouts of chronic )Tj
T*(tuberculosis, first diagnosed in the mid-1940s. )Tj
T*( In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the sixteenth greatest )Tj
T*(female movie star of all time. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life and acting debut )Tj
T*( Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley in the campus of St. Paul's School, )Tj
T*(Darjeeling, Bengal, India \(British India\), to Ernest Hartley, an English )Tj
T*(officer in the Indian Cavalry, and Gertrude Mary Robinson Yackjee \(1888â€“1972\), )Tj
T*(the daughter of Mary I. Robinson and John G. Yackjee, who wed in 1872. Ernest )Tj
T*(and Gertrude married in Kensington, London in 1912.[3] )Tj
T*( In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore, while Gertrude and )Tj
T*(Vivian stayed in Ootacamund.[4] Young Vivian made her first stage appearance at )Tj
T*(the age of three, reciting "Little Bo Peep" for her mother's amateur theatre )Tj
T*(group. Gertrude Hartley tried to instill in her daughter an appreciation of )Tj
T*(literature and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis )Tj
T*(Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian )Tj
T*(folklore. At the age of six in 1920, an only child, Vivian Hartley was sent to )Tj
T*(the Convent of the Sacred Heart \(now Woldingham School\) in Roehampton, )Tj
T*(south-west London, from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, by her devoutly Catholic )Tj
T*(mother. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two )Tj
T*(years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become "a great )Tj
T*(actress".[5][6] She was removed from the school by her father, who took her )Tj
T*(travelling in Europe with schools in the areas they travelled providing her )Tj
T*(schooling. They returned to Britain in 1931. She attended one of O'Sullivan's )Tj
T*(films playing in London's West End and told her parents of her ambitions to )Tj
T*(become an actress. Her father enrolled her at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art )Tj
T*(\(RADA\) in London.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] First marriage )Tj
T*( Vivian Hartley met \(Herbert\) Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in )Tj
T*(1931. Despite his disapproval of "theatrical people", they were married on 20 )Tj
T*(December 1932, and she terminated her studies at RADA. On 12 October 1933 in )Tj
T*(London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs. Robin Farrington,[8] )Tj
T*(who, decades later, would make Vivien Leigh a grandmother three times over.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early career )Tj
T*( Leigh's friends suggested she take a small role in the film Things Are Looking )Tj
T*(Up, which marked her film debut. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who )Tj
T*(believed that "Vivian Holman" was not a suitable name for an actress. After )Tj
T*(rejecting his suggestion, "April Morn", she took "Vivian Leigh" as her )Tj
T*(professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible )Tj
T*(film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential.[10] She was cast in )Tj
T*(the play The Mask of Virtue in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed )Tj
T*(by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the Daily )Tj
T*(Express, in which the interviewer noted "a lightening change came over her )Tj
T*(face", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood that )Tj
T*(became characteristic of her.[11]John Betjeman, the future Poet Laureate, also )Tj
T*(wrote about her, describing her as "the essence of English girlhood".[12] Korda )Tj
T*(attended her opening-night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a )Tj
T*(film contract, with the spelling of her name revised to "Vivien Leigh". She )Tj
T*(continued with the play; but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh )Tj
T*(was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention )Tj
T*(of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after.[13] )Tj

T*(critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, "some critics saw fit to be as )Tj
T*(foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a )Tj
T*(foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a )Tj
T*(responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me )Tj
T*(years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I )Tj
T*(find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven )Tj
T*(him."[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Meeting Laurence Olivier )Tj
T*( Laurence Olivier saw Leigh in The Mask of Virtue, and a friendship developed )Tj
T*(after he congratulated her on her performance. Olivier and Leigh began an )Tj
T*(affair after acting as lovers in Fire Over England \(1937\), when Olivier was )Tj
T*(married to actress Jill Esmond. During this time, Leigh read the Margaret )Tj
T*(Mitchell novel Gone with the Wind and instructed her American agent to suggest )Tj
T*(her to David O. Selznick, who was planning a film version. She remarked to a )Tj
T*(journalist, "I've cast myself as Scarlett O'Hara"; and The Observer film critic )Tj
T*(C.A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh "stunned )Tj
T*(us all" with the assertion that Olivier "won't play Rhett Butler, but I shall )Tj
T*(play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see."[15] )Tj
T*( Despite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to )Tj
T*(Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, )Tj
T*(Denmark.[16] Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed )Tj
T*(as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began )Tj
T*(screaming at him, before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She )Tj
T*(was able to perform without mishap; and, by the following day, she had returned )Tj
T*(to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier )Tj
T*(witnessed such behaviour from her.[17] They began living together, as their )Tj
T*(respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under )Tj
T*(the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had )Tj
T*(to be kept from public view. Leigh appeared with Robert Taylor, Lionel )Tj
T*(Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford \(1938\), the first of her )Tj
T*(films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she )Tj
T*(developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable; and Korda )Tj
T*(instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her )Tj
T*(behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in St. Martin's Lane \(1938\) with )Tj
T*(Charles Laughton.[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Achieving international success )Tj
T*( Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known )Tj
T*(in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to )Tj
T*(introduce him to the American market had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff )Tj
T*(in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights \(1939\), he travelled to )Tj
T*(Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William )Tj
T*(Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella; but she refused, )Tj
T*(preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.[19] )Tj
T*( Hollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to )Tj
T*(portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's production of Gone with the Wind )Tj
T*(\(1939\). Leigh's American theatrical agent was the London representative of the )Tj
T*(Myron Selznick Agency \(Myron was David's brother\). In February 1938, Leigh )Tj
T*(asked that she be allowed to play Scarlett O'Hara. Selznick, who watched her )Tj
T*(performance that month in Fire Over England and A Yank at Oxford, thought her )Tj
T*(to be excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett, as she was "too British". )Tj
T*(Leigh travelled to Los Angeles to be with Olivier and to try to convince )Tj
T*(Selznick that she was Scarlett. When Myron Selznick, who also represented )Tj
T*(Olivier, met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities his brother was )Tj
T*(searching for. Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the )Tj
T*(burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and introduced Leigh, )Tj
T*(telling his brother, "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara." The following )Tj
T*(day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organised a screen test and wrote to )Tj
T*(his wife, "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's )Tj
T*(ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan )Tj
T*(Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised )Tj

T*(Leigh's "incredible wildness"; she secured her role as Scarlett soon after.[20] )Tj
T*( Filming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by Victor )Tj
T*(Fleming, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and Olivia de Havilland )Tj
T*(secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they )Tj
T*(should play their parts. She befriended Clark Gable, his wife Carole Lombard )Tj
T*(and Olivia de Havilland; but she clashed with Leslie Howard, with whom she was )Tj
T*(required to play several emotional scenes. Leigh was sometimes required to work )Tj
T*(seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress; and )Tj
T*(she missed Olivier, who was working in New York. She said to Laurence Olivier )Tj
T*(on a long-distance call, "Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, )Tj
T*(and never want to do another film again!"[21] )Tj
T*( In 2006, Olivia de Havilland responded to claims of Leigh's manic behaviour )Tj
T*(during filming Gone with the Wind, published in a biography of Olivier. She )Tj
T*(defended Leigh, saying, "Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably )Tj
T*(disciplined on Gone with the Wind. She had two great concerns: doing her best )Tj
T*(work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], )Tj
T*(who was in New York."[22] )Tj
T*( Gone with the Wind brought Leigh immediate attention and fame; but she was )Tj
T*(quoted as saying, "I'm not a film star â€“ I'm an actress. Being a film star â€“ )Tj
T*(just a film star â€“ is such a false life, lived for fake values and for )Tj
T*(publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvelous parts )Tj
T*(to play."[23] Among the 10 Academy Awards won by Gone with the Wind was a Best )Tj
T*(Actress award for Leigh, who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for )Tj
T*(Best Actress. )Tj
T*( [edit] Marriage and joint projects )Tj
T*( In February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Olivier, and Leigh Holman )Tj
T*(agreed to divorce Leigh, although they maintained a strong friendship for the )Tj
T*(rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with )Tj
T*(Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 )Tj
T*(August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married in Santa Barbara, California, in a )Tj
T*(ceremony attended only by their witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin. )Tj
T*(Leigh had hoped to co-star with Olivier and made a screen test for Rebecca, )Tj
T*(which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role. )Tj
T*(After viewing Leigh's screen test, Selznick noted that "she doesn't seem right )Tj
T*(as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's )Tj
T*(mentor, George Cukor.[24] )Tj
T*( Selznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier )Tj
T*(had been confirmed as the lead actor so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused to )Tj
T*(allow her to join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice \(1940\), and Greer Garson )Tj
T*(played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge \(1940\) was to )Tj
T*(have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert )Tj
T*(Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most )Tj
T*(popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the )Tj
T*(film was popular with audiences and critics.[25] )Tj
T*( She and Olivier mounted a stage production of Romeo and Juliet for Broadway. )Tj
T*(The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier )Tj
T*(and Leigh's relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK )Tj
T*(to help with the war effort. Critics were hostile in their assessment of the )Tj
T*(production. Brooks Atkinson for The New York Times wrote: "Although Miss Leigh )Tj
T*(and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at )Tj
T*(all."[26] While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and )Tj
T*(direction, Leigh was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the )Tj
T*("thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice." The couple had invested almost )Tj
T*(their entire savings into the project, and the failure was a financial disaster )Tj
T*(for them.[27] )Tj
T*( They filmed That Hamilton Woman \(1941\) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and )Tj
T*(Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having entered the war, )Tj
T*(it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a )Tj
T*(pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the )Tj
T*(United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill )Tj

T*(arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on )Tj
T*(its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, "Gentlemen, I thought this film )Tj
T*(would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have )Tj
T*(just been taking part." The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, )Tj
T*(attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, )Tj
T*(of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, "By Jove, she's a clinker."[28] )Tj
T*( The Oliviers returned to Britain, and Leigh toured through North Africa in )Tj
T*(1943. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and )Tj
T*(fevers. In 1944, she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and )Tj
T*(spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was )Tj
T*(filming Caesar and Cleopatra \(1945\) when she discovered she was pregnant, but )Tj
T*(she suffered a miscarriage. She fell into a deep depression that hit the low )Tj
T*(point when she turned on Olivier, verbally and physically attacking him until )Tj
T*(she fell to the floor, sobbing. This was the first of many major breakdowns she )Tj
T*(suffered related to bipolar disorder. Olivier came to recognise the symptoms of )Tj
T*(an impending episode â€“ several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of )Tj
T*(depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory )Tj
T*(of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.[29] )Tj
T*( Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, in a successful London )Tj
T*(production of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth; but her films of this )Tj
T*(period, Caesar and Cleopatra \(1945\) and Anna Karenina \(1948\), were not great )Tj
T*(successes. )Tj
T*( In 1947, Olivier was knighted; and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace )Tj
T*(for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier. \(After their divorce, according )Tj
T*(to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known )Tj
T*(socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.\) )Tj
T*( By 1948, Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he )Tj
T*(and Leigh embarked on a six month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise )Tj
T*(funds for it. Olivier performed Richard III and also performed with Leigh in )Tj
T*(The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding )Tj
T*(success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her )Tj
T*(understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood )Tj
T*(the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to "charm the )Tj
T*(press." Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the )Tj
T*(couple, the most dramatic occurring in Christchurch when Leigh refused to go )Tj
T*(onstage. Olivier slapped her face, and Leigh slapped him in return and swore at )Tj
T*(him before she made her way to the stage. By the end of the tour, both were )Tj
T*(exhausted and ill; and Olivier told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you )Tj
T*(are talking to a couple of walking corpses." Later, he would comment that he )Tj
T*("lost Vivien" in Australia.[30] )Tj
T*( The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End )Tj
T*(appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, Antigone, )Tj
T*(included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy. )Tj
T*( Leigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production )Tj
T*(of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams )Tj
T*(and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal )Tj
T*(and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. Containing a rape scene and )Tj
T*(references to promiscuity and homosexuality, the play was destined to be )Tj
T*(controversial, and the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's )Tj
T*(anxiety, but she believed strongly in the importance of the work. )Tj
T*( When the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949, J. B. )Tj
T*(Priestley denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic Kenneth )Tj
T*(Tynan commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were "too )Tj
T*(well-bred to emote effectively on stage". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that )Tj
T*(part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to )Tj
T*(see what they believed would be a salacious and sensationalist story, rather )Tj
T*(than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned; but the play also had strong )Tj
T*(supporters,[31] among them NoÃ«l Coward who described Leigh as )Tj

T*(establish a rapport with her co-star Marlon Brando, but she had difficulty with )Tj
T*(director Elia Kazan, who did not hold her in high regard as an actress. He )Tj
T*(later commented that "she had a small talent" but, as work progressed, he )Tj
T*(became "full of admiration" for "the greatest determination to excel of any )Tj
T*(actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it )Tj
T*(would help her performance." Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to )Tj
T*(the Los Angeles Times, "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now )Tj
T*(she's in command of me."[33] Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was )Tj
T*(to co-star in William Wyler's Carrie. )Tj
T*( The film won glowing reviews for her and she won a second Academy Award for )Tj
T*(Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts \(BAFTA\) Award for )Tj
T*(Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best )Tj
T*(Actress. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role )Tj
T*("everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of" but, in )Tj
T*(later years, Leigh would say playing Blanche DuBois "tipped me over into )Tj
T*(madness."[34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Struggle with illness )Tj
T*( In 1951, Leigh and Olivier performed two plays about Cleopatra, William )Tj
T*(Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and )Tj
T*(Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took )Tj
T*(the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the Ziegfeld )Tj
T*(Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but the critic )Tj
T*(Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent )Tj
T*(that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated )Tj
T*(another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving )Tj
T*(greatness, dwelt on his comments while ignoring the positive reviews of other )Tj
T*(critics.[35] )Tj
T*( In January 1953, Leigh travelled to Ceylon to film Elephant Walk with Peter )Tj
T*(Finch. Shortly after filming commenced, she suffered a breakdown; and Paramount )Tj
T*(Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor. Olivier returned her to their home )Tj
T*(in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him that she was )Tj
T*(in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him. She gradually )Tj
T*(recovered over a period of several months. As a result of this episode, many of )Tj
T*(the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. David Niven said she had been )Tj
T*("quite, quite mad"; and in his diary NoÃ«l Coward expressed surprise that )Tj
T*("things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts."[36] )Tj
T*( In 1953, Leigh recovered sufficiently to play The Sleeping Prince with )Tj
T*(Olivier; and, in 1955, they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in )Tj
T*(Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Macbeth, and Titus Andronicus. They played to )Tj
T*(capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly )Tj
T*(stable. John Gielgud directed Twelfth Night and wrote, "...perhaps I will still )Tj
T*(make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her )Tj
T*(little ladyship \(who is brainier than he but not a born actress\) out of her )Tj
T*(timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently ... but she hardly dares at all )Tj
T*(and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has )Tj
T*(not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice."[37] )Tj
T*( Leigh took the lead role in the NoÃ«l Coward play South Sea Bubble, but she )Tj
T*(became pregnant and withdrew from the production. Several weeks later, she )Tj
T*(miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. She )Tj
T*(joined Olivier for a European tour with Titus Andronicus, but the tour was )Tj
T*(marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the )Tj
T*(company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who )Tj
T*(continued to exert a strong influence over her, stayed with the Oliviers and )Tj
T*(helped calm her. )Tj
T*( In 1958, considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with )Tj

T*(America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive )Tj
T*(reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier. Though she was still beset )Tj
T*(by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won )Tj
T*(a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Tovarich. She also )Tj
T*(appeared in the films The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone \(1961\) and Ship of Fools )Tj
T*(\(1965\).[40] )Tj
T*( In May 1967, she was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward )Tj
T*(Albee's A Delicate Balance when she suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis.[41] )Tj
T*(Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July )Tj
T*(1967, Merivale left her as usual, to perform in a play, and returned home )Tj
T*(around midnight to find her asleep. About thirty minutes later, he returned to )Tj
T*(the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to )Tj
T*(walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, collapsed.[42] )Tj
T*(Merivale contacted Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in )Tj
T*(a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his "grievous )Tj
T*(anguish" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that )Tj
T*(Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and "stood )Tj
T*(and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between )Tj
T*(us",[43] before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements. )Tj
T*( Leigh's death certificate gave her date of death as 8 July, but some )Tj
T*(references give the date as 7 July. )Tj
T*( She was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were scattered )Tj
T*(on the lake at her home, Tickerage Mill, near Blackboys, East Sussex, England. )Tj
T*(A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a final tribute )Tj
T*(read by John Gielgud. In the United States, she became the first actress )Tj
T*(honoured by "The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern )Tj
T*(California". The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections )Tj
T*(from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George )Tj
T*(Cukor.[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her )Tj
T*(directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her )Tj
T*(beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, )Tj
T*("People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and )Tj
T*(as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you )Tj
T*(really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like )Tj
T*(you."[14] )Tj
T*( Director George Cukor commented that Leigh was a "consummate actress, hampered )Tj
T*(by beauty",[45] and Laurence Olivier said that critics should "give her credit )Tj
T*(for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted )Tj
T*(by her great beauty."[46]Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described )Tj
T*(Leigh as "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her )Tj
T*(staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great )Tj
T*(actresses â€” simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; )Tj
T*(ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired."[47] )Tj

T*(attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She )Tj
T*(believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required )Tj
T*(more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as )Tj
T*(part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from )Tj
T*(NoÃ«l Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, "It's much )Tj
T*(easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."[14] )Tj
T*( Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she )Tj
T*(remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of Gone )Tj
T*(with the Wind. In December 1939, The New York Times wrote, "Miss Leigh's )Tj
T*(Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. )Tj
T*(She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other )Tj
T*(actress in the role would be inconceivable",[48] and as her fame escalated, she )Tj
T*(was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett. In 1969, critic Andrew )Tj
T*(Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to "the )Tj
T*(inspired casting" of Leigh,[49] and in 1998 wrote that "she lives in our minds )Tj
T*(and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence."[50]Leonard )Tj
T*(Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that )Tj
T*(Leigh "brilliantly played" her role.[51] )Tj
T*( Her performance in the West End production of A Streetcar Named Desire, )Tj
T*(described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as "proof of greater powers as )Tj
T*(an actress than she had hitherto shown", led to a lengthy period during which )Tj
T*(she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre.[52] )Tj
T*(Discussing the subsequent film version, Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and )Tj
T*(Marlon Brando gave "two of the greatest performances ever put on film" and that )Tj
T*(Leigh's was "one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke )Tj
T*(both fear and pity."[53] )Tj
T*( Kenneth Tynan ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 )Tj
T*(production of Titus Andronicus, commenting that she "receives the news that she )Tj
T*(is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild )Tj
T*(annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber."[54] He was one of )Tj
T*(several critics to react negatively to her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in )Tj
T*(1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary )Tj
T*(fury demanded of the role; however, after her death he revised his opinion, )Tj
T*(describing his earlier criticism as "one of the worst errors of judgment" he )Tj
T*(had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady )Tj
T*(Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, "made more sense )Tj
T*([...] than the usual battle-axe" portrayal of the character. In a survey of )Tj
T*(theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named it as one )Tj
T*(of her greatest achievements in theatre.[55] )Tj
T*( In 1969, a plaque to Leigh was placed in the "Actors' Church", St Paul's, )Tj
T*(Covent Garden, London. In 1985, a portrait of her was included in a series of )Tj
T*(United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir Charlie )Tj
T*(Chaplin, Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate "British Film Year".[56] )Tj
T*( The British Library in London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from )Tj
T*(his estate in 1999. Known as The Laurence Olivier Archive, the collection )Tj
T*(includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she )Tj
T*(wrote to Olivier. The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, )Tj
T*(contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington. In )Tj
T*(1994, the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album, )Tj
T*(monogrammed "L &amp; V O" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, )Tj

T*(Special Category Status for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, after a )Tj
T*(number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to "slop out", the dispute )Tj
T*(escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells )Tj
T*(to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980, seven )Tj
T*(prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53Â )Tj
T*(days.[1] )Tj
T*( The second hunger strike took place in 1981 and was a showdown between the )Tj
T*(prisoners and the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. One hunger striker, Bobby )Tj
T*(Sands, was elected as a Member of Parliament during the strike, prompting media )Tj
T*(interest from around the world.[2] The strike was called off after ten )Tj
T*(prisoners had starved themselves to deathâ€”including Sands, whose funeral was )Tj
T*(attended by 100,000Â people.[1] The strike radicalised nationalist politics, and )Tj
T*(was the driving force that enabled Sinn FÃ©in to become a mainstream political )Tj
T*(party.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( There had been hunger strikes by Irish republican prisoners since 1917, and )Tj
T*(twelve men had previously died on hunger strikes including Thomas Ashe, Terence )Tj
T*(MacSwiney, SeÃ¡n McCaughey, Michael Gaughan and Frank Stagg.[4] After the )Tj
T*(introduction of internment in 1971, Long Keshâ€”later known as HM Prison Mazeâ€”was )Tj
T*(run like a prisoner of war camp. Internees lived in dormitories and disciplined )Tj
T*(themselves with military-style command structures, drilled with dummy guns made )Tj
T*(from wood, and held lectures on guerrilla warfare and revolutionary )Tj
T*(politics.[5] Convicted prisoners were refused the same rights as internees )Tj
T*(until July 1972, when Special Category Status was introduced following a hunger )Tj
T*(strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army \(IRA\) prisoners led by the )Tj
T*(veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant )Tj
T*(prisoners were treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having )Tj
T*(to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.[5] In 1976, as part of the policy of )Tj
T*("criminalisation", the British Government brought an end to Special Category )Tj
T*(Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The policy was not )Tj
T*(introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted of offences after 1 )Tj
T*(March 1976.[6] The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the )Tj
T*(authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to )Tj
T*(exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Blanket and dirty protests )Tj
T*( On 14 September 1976, newly convicted prisoner Kieran Nugent began the blanket )Tj
T*(protest, in which IRA and Irish National Liberation Army \(INLA\) prisoners )Tj
T*(refused to wear prison uniform and either went naked or fashioned garments from )Tj
T*(prison blankets.[6] In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving )Tj
T*(their cells to "slop out" \(i.e., empty their chamber pots\), this escalated into )Tj
T*(the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of )Tj
T*(their cells with excrement.[7] These protests aimed to re-establish their )Tj
T*(political status by securing what were known as the "Five Demands": )Tj
T*( The right not to wear a prison uniform;)Tj
T*(The right not to do prison work;)Tj
T*(The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational )Tj
T*(and recreational pursuits;)Tj
T*(The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week;)Tj
T*(Full restoration of remission lost through the protest.[8])Tj
T*(  Initially, this protest did not attract a great deal of attention, and even )Tj
T*(the IRA regarded it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign.[9][10] It )Tj
T*(began to attract attention when TomÃ¡s Ã“ Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop )Tj
T*(of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there.[11] In 1979, )Tj
T*(former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European )Tj
T*(Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% )Tj
T*(of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn FÃ©in had called for a )Tj
T*(boycott of this election.[12][13] Shortly after this, the broad-based National )Tj
T*(H-Block/Armagh Committee was formed, on a platform of support for the "Five )Tj
T*(Demands", with McAliskey as its main spokesperson.[14][15] The period leading )Tj
T*(up to the hunger strike saw assassinations by both republicans and loyalists. )Tj

T*( [edit] First hunger strike )Tj
T*( On 27 October 1980, republican prisoners in HM Prison Maze began a hunger )Tj
T*(strike. Many prisoners volunteered to be part of the strike, but a total of )Tj
T*(seven were selected to match the number of men who signed the Easter 1916 )Tj
T*(Proclamation of the Republic. The group consisted of IRA members Brendan )Tj
T*(Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo )Tj
T*(Green, and INLA member John Nixon.[19] On 1 December three prisoners in Armagh )Tj
T*(Women's Prison joined the strike, including MairÃ©ad Farrell, followed by a )Tj
T*(short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In )Tj
T*(a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with )Tj
T*(McKenna lapsing in and out of a coma and on the brink of death, the government )Tj
T*(appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a )Tj
T*(thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in )Tj
T*(transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the )Tj
T*(strike after 53 days on 18 December.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Second hunger strike )Tj
T*( In January 1981 it became clear that the prisoners' demands had not been )Tj
T*(conceded. Prison authorities began to supply the prisoners with officially )Tj
T*(issued civilian clothing, whereas the prisoners demanded the right to wear )Tj
T*(their own clothing. On 4 February the prisoners issued a statement saying that )Tj
T*(the British government had failed to resolve the crisis and declared their )Tj
T*(intention of "hunger striking once more".[20] The second hunger strike began on )Tj
T*(1 March, when Bobby Sands, the IRA's former Officer Commanding \(OC\) in the )Tj
T*(prison, refused food. Unlike the first strike, the prisoners joined one at a )Tj
T*(time and at staggered intervals, which they believed would arouse maximum )Tj
T*(public support and exert maximum pressure on Prime Minister Margaret )Tj
T*(Thatcher.[21] )Tj
T*( The republican movement initially struggled to generate public support for the )Tj
T*(second hunger strike. The Sunday before Sands began his strike, 3,500 people )Tj
T*(marched through west Belfast; during the first hunger strike four months )Tj
T*(earlier the marchers had numbered 10,000.[22] Five days into the strike, )Tj
T*(however, Independent Republican MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Frank Maguire )Tj
T*(died, resulting in a by-election. There was debate among nationalists and )Tj
T*(republicans regarding who should contest the election: Austin Currie of the )Tj
T*(Social Democratic and Labour Party expressed an interest, as did Bernadette )Tj
T*(McAliskey and Maguire's brother Noel.[1] After negotiations, and implied )Tj
T*(threats to Noel Maguire, they agreed not to split the nationalist vote by )Tj

T*(Ulster Unionist Party candidate Harry West.[22][23] Following a high-profile )Tj
T*(campaign the election took place on 9 April, and Sands was elected to the )Tj
T*(British House of Commons with 30,492 votes to West's 29,046.[24] )Tj
T*( Sands' election victory raised hopes that a settlement could be negotiated, )Tj
T*(but Thatcher stood firm in refusing to give concessions to the hunger strikers. )Tj
T*(She stated "We are not prepared to consider special category status for certain )Tj
T*(groups of people serving sentences for crime. Crime is crime is crime, it is )Tj
T*(not political".[25] The world's media descended on Belfast, and several )Tj

T*(strike, including SÃ­le de Valera, granddaughter of Ã‰amon de Valera, Pope John )Tj
T*(Paul II's personal envoy John Magee, and European Commission of Human Rights )Tj
T*(officials.[2][26] With Sands close to death, the government's position remained )Tj
T*(unchanged, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Humphrey Atkins stating )Tj
T*("If Mr. Sands persisted in his wish to commit suicide, that was his choice. The )Tj

T*("under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he )Tj
T*(should die".[27] Over 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was )Tj
T*(conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no regret )Tj
T*(for his death, telling the House of Commons that, "Mr. Sands was a convicted )Tj
T*(criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation )Tj
T*(did not allow to many of its victims".[26] )Tj
T*( In the two weeks following Sands' death, three more hunger strikers died. )Tj
T*(Francis Hughes died on 12 May, resulting in further rioting in nationalist )Tj
T*(areas of Northern Ireland, in particular Derry and Belfast. Following the )Tj
T*(deaths of Raymond McCreesh and Patsy Oâ€™Hara on 21 May, TomÃ¡s Ã“ Fiaich, by then )Tj
T*(Primate of All Ireland, criticised the British government's handling of the )Tj
T*(hunger strike.[1] Despite this, Thatcher still refused to negotiate a )Tj
T*(settlement, stating "Faced with the failure of their discredited cause, the men )Tj
T*(of violence have chosen in recent months to play what may well be their last )Tj
T*(card", during a visit to Belfast in late May.[27] )Tj
T*( Nine protesting prisoners contested the general election in the Republic of )Tj
T*(Ireland in June. Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew \(who was not on hunger strike\) )Tj
T*(were elected in Cavanâ€“Monaghan and Louth respectively, and Joe McDonnell )Tj
T*(narrowly missed election in Sligoâ€“Leitrim.[28][29] There were also local )Tj
T*(elections in Northern Ireland around that time and although Sinn FÃ©in did not )Tj
T*(contest them, some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger )Tj
T*(strikers won seats, e.g. the Irish Independence Party won 21 seats, while the )Tj
T*(Irish Republican Socialist Party \(the INLA's political wing\) and People's )Tj
T*(Democracy \(a Trotskyist group\) won two seats each, and a number of pro-hunger )Tj
T*(strike independent candidates also won seats.[30][31] The British government )Tj
T*(rushed through the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another )Tj
T*(prisoner contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which )Tj
T*(was due to take place following the death of Sands.[1] )Tj
T*( Following the deaths of Joe McDonnell and Martin Hurson the families of some )Tj
T*(of the hunger strikers attended a meeting on 28 July with Catholic priest )Tj
T*(Father Denis Faul. The families expressed concern at the lack of a settlement )Tj
T*(to the priest, and a decision was made to meet with Gerry Adams later that day. )Tj
T*(At the meeting Father Faul put pressure on Adams to find a way of ending the )Tj
T*(strike, and Adams agreed to ask the IRA leadership to order the men to end the )Tj
T*(hunger strike.[32] The following day Adams held a meeting with six of the )Tj
T*(hunger strikers to outline a proposed settlement on offer from the British )Tj
T*(government should the strike be brought to an end.[33] The strikers rejected )Tj
T*(the settlement, believing that accepting anything less than the "Five Demands" )Tj
T*(would be a betrayal of the sacrifice made by Bobby Sands and the other men who )Tj
T*(had died.[34] )Tj
T*( On 31 July the hunger strike began to break, when the mother of Paddy Quinn )Tj
T*(insisted on medical intervention to save his life. The following day Kevin )Tj
T*(Lynch died, followed by Kieran Doherty on 2 August, Thomas McElwee on 8 August )Tj
T*(and Michael Devine on 20 August.[35] On the day Devine died, Sands' election )Tj
T*(agent Owen Carron won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election with an )Tj
T*(increased number of votes.[36] On 6 September the family of Laurence McKeown )Tj
T*(became the fourth family to intervene and asked for medical treatment to save )Tj
T*(his life, and Cahal Daly issued a statement calling on republican prisoners to )Tj
T*(end the hunger strike. A week later James Prior replaced Humphrey Atkins as )Tj
T*(Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and met with prisoners in an attempt )Tj
T*(to end the strike.[1] Liam McCloskey ended his strike on 26 September after his )Tj
T*(family said they would ask for medical intervention if he became unconscious, )Tj
T*(and it became clear that the families of the remaining hunger strikers would )Tj
T*(also intervene to save their lives. The strike was called off at 3:15Â pm on 3 )Tj
T*(October,[37] and three days later Prior announced partial concessions to the )Tj
T*(prisoners including the right to wear their own clothes at all times.[3] The )Tj
T*(only one of the "Five Demands" still outstanding was the right not to do prison )Tj
T*(work. Following sabotage by the prisoners and the Maze Prison escape in 1983 )Tj

T*( [edit] Consequences )Tj
T*( The British press hailed the hunger strike as a triumph for Thatcher, with The )Tj
T*(Guardian newspaper stating "The Government had overcome the hunger strikes by a )Tj
T*(show of resolute determination not to be bullied".[42] However, the hunger )Tj
T*(strike was a Pyrrhic victory for Thatcher and the British government.[43] )Tj
T*(Thatcher became a republican hate figure of Cromwellian proportions, with Danny )Tj
T*(Morrison describing her as "the biggest bastard we have ever known".[43] There )Tj
T*(was extensive international condemnation of the British government's handling )Tj
T*(of the hunger strike, and the relationship between the British and Irish )Tj
T*(governments was strained.[2] As with internment in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in )Tj
T*(1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, resulting in a new surge of paramilitary )Tj
T*(activity.[43] There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet )Tj
T*(years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and )Tj
T*(rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin.[1] Security forces fired 29,695 )Tj
T*(plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared to a total of around )Tj

T*(16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger )Tj
T*(strikes.[44] The IRA continued its armed campaign during the seven months of )Tj
T*(the strike, killing thirteen policemen, eight soldiers, five members of the )Tj
T*(Ulster Defence Regiment and five civilians. The seven months were one of the )Tj
T*(bloodiest periods of the Troubles with a total of 61 people killed, 34 of them )Tj
T*(civilians.[21] Three years later the IRA tried to take their revenge on )Tj
T*(Thatcher with the Brighton hotel bombing, an attack on the Conservative party )Tj
T*(conference that killed five people and in which Thatcher herself only narrowly )Tj
T*(escaped death.[2] )Tj
T*( The hunger strike prompted Sinn FÃ©in to move towards electoral politicsâ€”Sands' )Tj
T*(election victory combined with that of pro-hunger strike candidates in the )Tj
T*(Northern Ireland local elections and DÃ¡il elections in the Republic of Ireland )Tj
T*(gave birth to the armalite and ballot box strategy, with Gerry Adams remarking )Tj
T*("His [Sands] victory exposed the lie that the hunger strikersâ€”and by extension )Tj
T*(the IRA and the whole republican movementâ€”had no popular support".[45] The )Tj
T*(election victories of Doherty and Agnew also had political impact in the )Tj
T*(Republic of Ireland, as they denied power to Charles Haughey's outgoing Fianna )Tj
T*(FÃ¡il government.[28] In 1982 Sinn FÃ©in won five seats in the elections to the )Tj
T*(Northern Ireland Assembly, and in 1983 Gerry Adams won a seat in the UK general )Tj
T*(election.[46] As a result of the political base built during the hunger strike, )Tj
T*(Sinn FÃ©in continued to grow in the following two decades, and it is currently )Tj
T*(the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland holding 29 out of 108 seats )Tj
T*(in the Northern Ireland Assembly.[3][47] )Tj
T*( In 2005, the role of Gerry Adams was questioned by former prisoner Richard )Tj
T*(O'Rawe, who was the public relations officer inside the prison during the )Tj
T*(strike. O'Rawe states in his book Blanketmen that Adams prolonged the strike as )Tj
T*(it was of great political benefit to Sinn FÃ©in and allowed Owen Carron to win )Tj
T*(Sands' seat.[48][49] This claim is denied by several hunger strikers and )Tj
T*(Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike.[50] )Tj
T*(McFarlane claims O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and )Tj
T*(states "We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to )Tj
T*(meeting the five demands would have been taken. If it was confirmed in writing, )Tj
T*(we'd have grabbed it . . . There was never a deal, there was never a "take it )Tj
T*(or leave it" option at all".[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Commemorations )Tj
T*( There are memorials and murals in memory of the hunger strikers in towns and )Tj
T*(cities across Ireland, including Belfast, Dublin, Derry, Crossmaglen and )Tj
T*(Camlough.[52] Annual commemorations take place across Ireland for each man who )Tj
T*(died on the hunger strike, and an annual hunger strike commemoration march is )Tj
T*(held in Belfast each year, which includes a Bobby Sands memorial )Tj
T*(lecture.[53][54] Several towns and cities in France have named streets after )Tj
T*(Bobby Sands, including Paris and Le Mans.[2][55] The Iranian government also )Tj
T*(named a street running alongside the British embassy in Tehran after Bobby )Tj
T*(Sands, which was formerly called Winston Churchill Street.[56] )Tj
T*( A memorial to the men who died in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Easter )Tj
T*(Rising and the hunger strike stands in Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, Australia, )Tj
T*(which is also the burial place of Michael Dwyer of the Society of United )Tj
T*(Irishmen.[57][58] In 1997 the people of Hartford, Connecticut, in the United )Tj
T*(States dedicated a monument to Bobby Sands and the other hunger strikers.[59] )Tj
T*(The monument stands in a traffic circle known as "Bobby Sands Circle", at the )Tj
T*(bottom of Maple Avenue near Goodwin Park.[60] On 20 March 2001 Sinn FÃ©in's )Tj
T*(national chairperson Mitchel McLaughlin opened the National Hunger Strike )Tj
T*(Commemoration Committee's exhibition at the Europa Hotel in Belfast, which )Tj
T*(included three original works of art from Belfast-based artists.[61] A separate )Tj
T*(exhibition was also launched in Derry the following month.[62] Three films have )Tj
T*(been made based on the events of the hunger strike, Some Mother's Son starring )Tj
T*(Helen Mirren, H3 \(which was co-written by former hunger striker Laurence )Tj
T*(McKeown\), and Steve McQueen's Hunger. )Tj

T*(or regional, covering only part of the Earth. Regional models \(also known as )Tj

T*(Another tool where ensemble spread is used is a meteogram, which shows the )Tj
T*(dispersion in the forecast of one quantity for one specific location. It is )Tj
T*(common for the ensemble spread to be too small to include the weather that )Tj
T*(actually occurs, which can lead to forecasters misdiagnosing model )Tj
T*(uncertainty;[68] this problem becomes particularly severe for forecasts of the )Tj
T*(weather about ten days in advance.[69] When ensemble spread is small and the )Tj
T*(forecast solutions are consistent within multiple model runs, forecasters )Tj
T*(perceive more confidence in the ensemble mean, and the forecast in general.[68] )Tj
T*(Despite this perception, a spread-skill relationship is often weak or not )Tj
T*(found, as spread-error correlations are normally less than 0.6, and only under )Tj
T*(special circumstances range between 0.6â€“0.7.[70] The relationship between )Tj
T*(ensemble spread and forecast skill varies substantially depending on such )Tj
T*(factors as the forecast model and the region for which the forecast is made. )Tj
T*( In the same way that many forecasts from a single model can be used to form an )Tj
T*(ensemble, multiple models may also be combined to produce an ensemble forecast. )Tj
T*(This approach is called multi-model ensemble forecasting, and it has been shown )Tj
T*(to improve forecasts when compared to a single model-based approach.[71] Models )Tj
T*(within a multi-model ensemble can be adjusted for their various biases, which )Tj
T*(is a process known as superensemble forecasting. This type of forecast )Tj
T*(significantly reduces errors in model output.[72] )Tj
T*( [edit] Applications )Tj
T*( [edit] Air quality modeling )Tj
T*( Air quality forecasting attempts to predict when the concentrations of )Tj
T*(pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. The )Tj
T*(concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by their transport, )Tj
T*(or mean velocity of movement through the atmosphere, their diffusion, chemical )Tj
T*(transformation, and ground deposition.[73] In addition to pollutant source and )Tj
T*(terrain information, these models require data about the state of the fluid )Tj
T*(flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion.[74] )Tj
T*(Meteorological conditions such as thermal inversions can prevent surface air )Tj
T*(from rising, trapping pollutants near the surface,[75] which makes accurate )Tj
T*(forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling. Urban air quality )Tj
T*(models require a very fine computational mesh, requiring the use of )Tj
T*(high-resolution mesoscale weather models; in spite of this, the quality of )Tj
T*(numerical weather guidance is the main uncertainty in air quality )Tj
T*(forecasts.[74] )Tj
T*( [edit] Climate modeling )Tj
T*( A General Circulation Model \(GCM\) is a mathematical model that can be used in )Tj
T*(computer simulations of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or )Tj
T*(ocean. An atmospheric general circulation model \(AGCM\) is essentially the same )Tj
T*(as a global numerical weather prediction model, and some \(such as the one used )Tj
T*(in the UK Unified Model\) can be configured for both short-term weather )Tj
T*(forecasts and longer-term climate predictions. Along with sea ice and )Tj
T*(land-surface components, AGCMs and oceanic GCMs \(OGCM\) are key components of )Tj
T*(global climate models, and are widely applied for understanding the climate and )Tj
T*(projecting climate change. For example, they can be used to simulate the El )Tj
T*(NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation and study its forcings on global climate and the )Tj
T*(Asian monsoon circulation. For aspects of climate change, a range of man-made )Tj
T*(chemical emission scenarios can be fed into the climate models to see how an )Tj
T*(enhanced greenhouse effect would modify the Earth's climate.[76] Versions )Tj
T*(designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were )Tj
T*(originally created in 1969 by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical )Tj
T*(Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.[77] When run for multiple )Tj

T*( Tropical cyclone forecasting also relies on data provided by numerical weather )Tj

T*(climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast )Tj
T*(that is not based on the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical )Tj
T*(models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in )Tj
T*(the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area )Tj
T*(numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational )Tj
T*(techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. )Tj
T*(Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical )Tj
T*(models.[82] )Tj
T*( In 1978, the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamicsâ€”the )Tj
T*(movable fine-mesh \(MFM\) modelâ€”began operating.[12] Within the field of tropical )Tj
T*(cyclone track forecasting, despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance )Tj
T*(which occurred with increased computational power, it was not until the 1980s )Tj
T*(when numerical weather prediction showed skill, and until the 1990s when it )Tj
T*(consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models.[83] )Tj
T*(Predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather )Tj
T*(prediction continue to be a challenge, since statistical methods continue to )Tj
T*(show higher skill over dynamical guidance.[84] )Tj
T*( [edit] Wildfire modeling )Tj
T*( On a molecular scale, there are two main competing reaction processes involved )Tj
T*(in the degradation of cellulose, or wood fuels, in wildfires. When there is a )Tj
T*(low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, volatilization of the fuel occurs; )Tj
T*(this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately )Tj
T*(be the source of combustion. When moisture is presentâ€”or when enough heat is )Tj
T*(being carried away from the fiber, charring occurs. The chemical kinetics of )Tj
T*(both reactions indicate that there is a point at which the level of moisture is )Tj
T*(low enoughâ€”and/or heating rates high enoughâ€”for combustion processes become )Tj
T*(self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, )Tj
T*(temperature, or lapse rate at different levels of the atmosphere can have a )Tj
T*(significant impact on the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire )Tj
T*(acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local )Tj
T*(advection patterns, introducing a feedback loop between the fire and the )Tj
T*(atmosphere.[85] )Tj
T*( A simplified two-dimensional model for the spread of wildfires that used )Tj
T*(convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as radiative )Tj
T*(heat transfer as the dominant method of heat transport led to )Tj
T*(reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations.[86][87] More )Tj
T*(complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics )Tj
T*(models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the )Tj

T*(power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion )Tj

T*(War[12] \(due to which McCain maintains a membership with the Sons of the )Tj
T*(American Revolution\),[13]War of 1812,[14] for the Confederate States of America )Tj
T*(in the American Civil War,[8] and in World War I.[5] The tree also includes )Tj
T*(roguish behavior and economic success. John McCain's maternal grandfather, )Tj
T*(Archibald Wright \(1875â€“1971\),[15] was a Mississippi native who migrated to )Tj
T*(Muskogee, Oklahoma in his twenties, ran afoul of the law with several gambling )Tj
T*(and bootlegging charges,[15] then became a strong-willed wildcatter who )Tj
T*(prospered on land deals during the early statehood years and struck oil in the )Tj
T*(Southwest.[15][16] Rich by age forty, he never worked again and became a )Tj
T*(stay-at-home father.[5][16] Raising a family in Oklahoma and Southern )Tj
T*(California, he instilled in Roberta and her twin sister Rowena a lifelong habit )Tj
T*(of travel and adventure.[17] There is also independent-minded behavior in the )Tj
T*(family tree: Jack McCain and Roberta Wright eloped and married in a bar in )Tj
T*(Tijuana, Mexico, when Archibald Wright's wife Myrtle objected to Roberta's )Tj
T*(association with a sailor.[18] )Tj
T*( McCain's father and paternal grandfather eventually became Navy admirals, and )Tj
T*(were the first father-son pair to achieve four-star admiral rank.[19] His )Tj
T*(grandfather, Admiral John S. "Slew" McCain, Sr. \(1884â€“1945\), was a pioneer of )Tj
T*(aircraft carrier operations[5] who in 1942 commanded all land-based air )Tj
T*(operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign, and who ultimately in )Tj
T*(1944â€“1945 aggressively led the Fast Carrier Task Force in the Pacific Ocean )Tj
T*(theater of World War II. His operations off the Philippines and Okinawa, and )Tj
T*(air strikes against Formosa and the Japanese home islands, caused tremendous )Tj
T*(destruction of Japanese naval and air forces in the closing period of the )Tj
T*(war.[20] His death four days after the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay )Tj
T*(was front page news.[5] Jack McCain was a submarine commander in several )Tj
T*(theaters of operation in World War II and was decorated with both the Silver )Tj
T*(Star and Bronze Star.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( For his first ten years, "Johnny" McCain \(the family nickname he was given\)[2] )Tj
T*(was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister Sandy \(born 1934\) )Tj
T*(and younger brother Joe \(born 1942\),[5][18] followed his father to New London, )Tj
T*(Connecticut, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other stations in the Pacific Ocean.[21] )Tj
T*(Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation,[10] but )Tj
T*(McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern.[8] McCain attended )Tj
T*(whatever naval base school was available,[21] often to the detriment of his )Tj
T*(education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often )Tj
T*(erratic.[21] After the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, his father was absent for )Tj
T*(long stretches.[5] His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his )Tj
T*(mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose )Tj
T*(him to historical and cultural sites.[17][22] He later wrote, "She taught me to )Tj
T*(find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of )Tj
T*(living."[22] A Republican, she also made sure that he followed current events, )Tj
T*(although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's )Tj
T*(military career.[23] )Tj
T*( After World War II ended, his father stayed in the Navy, sometimes working )Tj
T*(political liaison posts.[5] The family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain )Tj
T*(attended the educationally stronger St. Stephen's School in Alexandria from )Tj
T*(1946 to 1949.[24] To his family, McCain had long been quiet, dependable, and )Tj
T*(courteous,[5] while at St. Stephen's he began to develop an unruly, defiant )Tj
T*(streak.[25] Another two years were then spent following his father to naval )Tj
T*(stations;[26] altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth.[27] )Tj
T*(He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting.[28] He later wrote, "The )Tj
T*(repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood )Tj
T*(constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career... At each new school )Tj
T*(I arrived eager to make, by means of my insolent attitude, new friends to )Tj

T*( In 1951, McCain enrolled at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, an )Tj
T*(academically superior, all-male private boarding school with a rigorous honor )Tj
T*(code, tradition of hazing, and spartan living environment.[30][31] Most of the )Tj
T*(children there were sons of wealthy Southerners, from whom McCain got a glimpse )Tj
T*(of life and career aspirations outside the Navy culture.[32] Nicknamed "Punk" )Tj
T*(and "McNasty" due to his combative, fiery disposition, McCain enjoyed and )Tj
T*(cultivated that tough guy image; he also made a few friends.[5][25][33][34] )Tj
T*(McCain earned two varsity letters in wrestling, excelling in the lighter weight )Tj
T*(classes.[35] He also played on the junior varsity football team and the tennis )Tj
T*(team, and participated in the student newspaper, yearbook, and drama club.[36] )Tj
T*(English teacher William Bee Ravenel III, who was also his football coach, )Tj
T*(became a great influence towards his sense of learning, honor, and )Tj
T*(self-image.[37] With what he later termed an "undistinguished, but acceptable" )Tj
T*(academic record,[38] McCain graduated from high school in 1954.[25] )Tj
T*( [edit] Naval Academy )Tj
T*( Having done well on its entrance exams,[5] McCain entered the United States )Tj
T*(Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in June 1954, following in the footsteps )Tj
T*(of his father and grandfather.[39] He had neither been ordered to go there by )Tj
T*(his parents nor discussed alternatives; as he later wrote, "I remember simply )Tj
T*(recognizing my eventual enrollment at the Academy as an immutable fact of life, )Tj
T*(and accepting it without comment."[40] )Tj
T*( Ambivalent about his presence there,[39] McCain chose not to conform to the )Tj
T*(Academy's rules and some of its traditions.[41] Each year he was given over a )Tj
T*(hundred demerits â€“ earning him membership in the "Century Club"[19] â€“ for )Tj
T*(offenses such as shoes not being shined, formation faults, room in disorder, )Tj
T*(and talking out of place.[39] His father came to the Academy to reprimand him )Tj
T*(on his behavior a number of times.[31] He hated "plebe year", the trial by )Tj
T*(ordeal and hazing of entering midshipmen that would eventually weed out one )Tj
T*(quarter of the class.[42] He did not take well to those of higher rank )Tj
T*(arbitrarily wielding power over him â€“ "It was bullshit, and I resented the hell )Tj
T*(out of it"[39] â€“ and occasionally intervened when he saw it being done to )Tj
T*(others.[19][31] At 5-foot 7Â inches[12] and 127Â pounds[43] \(1.70Â m and 58Â kg\), )Tj
T*(he competed as a lightweight boxer for three years, where he lacked skills but )Tj
T*(was fearless and "didn't have a reverse gear".[43] In his final year, he )Tj
T*(managed the battalion boxing team to a brigade championship.[44] )Tj
T*( Possessed of a strong intelligence,[45] McCain did well in a few subjects that )Tj
T*(interested him, such as English literature, history, and government.[19][39] )Tj
T*(There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all )Tj
T*(midshipmen;[46][47][48] McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming )Tj
T*(abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses[49] and thought his )Tj
T*(low grades were by inclination and not ability,[19] while McCain would later )Tj
T*(acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him.[50] His class rank was )Tj
T*(further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his )Tj
T*(sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company )Tj
T*(officer.[49][51] Despite his low standing, he was popular and a leader among )Tj
T*(his fellow midshipmen, in what biographer Robert Timberg called a "manic, )Tj
T*(intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way".[39] Good at attracting women,[19] he was )Tj
T*(famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves )Tj
T*("the Bad Bunch";[31] one classmate said that "being on liberty with John McCain )Tj
T*(was like being in a train wreck."[39] Other midshipmen were annoyed by his )Tj
T*(behavior.[31] A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer USSÂ Hunt[52] )Tj
T*(found McCain showing good skills at the conn,[53] and the destination stop in )Tj
T*(Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and )Tj
T*(ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime )Tj
T*(reunion.[54][55] )Tj
T*( McCain graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1958; he was fifth from the )Tj

T*(wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same )Tj
T*(mettle as his naval forebears.[56] Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had )Tj
T*(sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and )Tj
T*(bottom twentieth respectively.[57] McCain realized later that the Academy had )Tj
T*(taught him that "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime it would be )Tj
T*(necessary for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my )Tj
T*(self-interest", a lesson that he would need to carry him through a "desperate )Tj
T*(and uncertain" time a decade later.[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Military career )Tj
T*( [edit] Naval training, early assignments, first marriage, and children )Tj
T*( McCain was commissioned an ensign.[58] He spent two years as a naval aviator )Tj
T*(in training, first at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida through September )Tj
T*(1959, and then at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, during which time )Tj
T*(he was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade.[58][59] He earned a reputation as )Tj
T*(a party man, as he drove a Corvette, dated an exotic dancer named "Marie the )Tj
T*(Flame of Florida", spent all his free time on the beach or in a Bachelor )Tj
T*(Officer Quarters room turned bar and friendly gambling den, and, as he later )Tj
T*(said, "generally misused my good health and youth".[27][60] He began as a )Tj
T*(sub-par flier: he had limited patience for studying aviation manuals, and spent )Tj
T*(study time reading history books instead.[31][60] He was not assigned to the )Tj
T*(elite units flying fighter aircraft, and instead became a pilot of attack )Tj
T*(aircraft.[31] During a March 1960 practice run in Texas, he lost track of his )Tj
T*(altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider )Tj
T*(crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom.[61] Although )Tj
T*(momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact, he squeezed out of the cockpit )Tj
T*(and swam ten feet to the surface, escaping without major injuries.[59][61] He )Tj
T*(graduated from flight school at Corpus Christi[59] in May 1960.[58] He joined )Tj
T*(squadron VA-42 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for five months of )Tj
T*(further training on the Skyraider.[58] )Tj
T*( Starting in November 1960, McCain flew Skyraiders with the VA-65 "World Famous )Tj
T*(Fighting Tigers" squadron[58][62] on the aircraft carriers USSÂ Intrepid and USSÂ )Tj
T*(Enterprise.[63] The carriers were based at Naval Station Norfolk[62] and )Tj
T*(cruised in the Caribbean and in several deployments to the Mediterranean.[60] )Tj
T*(His aviation skills improved,[60][61] but around December 1961 he collided with )Tj
T*(power lines while recklessly flying too low over southern Spain.[61] The area )Tj
T*(suffered a power outage, but McCain was able to return his damaged Skyraider to )Tj
T*(Intrepid.[61] )Tj
T*( On board for Enterprise's maiden voyage in January 1962, McCain gained )Tj
T*(visibility with the captain and shipboard publicity that fellow sailors and )Tj
T*(aviators attributed to his famous last name.[61] McCain was made a lieutenant )Tj
T*(in June 1962,[58] and was on alert duty on Enterprise when it helped enforce )Tj
T*(the naval quarantine of Cuba during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.[64] )Tj
T*(In November 1963, he was rotated back to shore duty, serving nine months on the )Tj
T*(staff of the Naval Air Basic Training Command at Pensacola.[58][63] In )Tj
T*(September 1964, he became a flight instructor with the VT-7 training squadron )Tj
T*(at Naval Air Station Meridian in Mississippi,[58][65] where McCain Field had )Tj
T*(been named for his grandfather.[66] )Tj
T*( During the 1964 stint at Pensacola, McCain began a relationship with Carol )Tj
T*(Shepp, a successful swimwear and runway model[67][68] originally from )Tj
T*(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[59][60] They had known each other at the Naval )Tj
T*(Academy and she had married and then divorced one of his classmates.[59][63] )Tj
T*(McCain told her he wanted to do something important with his life, so he would )Tj
T*(be recorded in history.[69] On July 3, 1965, McCain married Shepp in )Tj
T*(Philadelphia.[70] She already had two children, Douglas and Andrew, born in )Tj
T*(1959 and 1962 respectively;[71] he adopted them in 1966.[72] Carol and he then )Tj
T*(had a daughter named Sidney in September 1966.[73] )Tj

T*(\(during the Fleming era\), winning one game and losing the next.[74][75] )Tj

T*(requested a combat assignment.[76] In October 1966, he was slated for upcoming )Tj
T*(Vietnam War duty, and so reported to the VA-44 Replacement Air Group squadron )Tj
T*(at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Florida for training on the A-4 Skyhawk, a )Tj
T*(single-seat jet attack aircraft.[58][76][77] There McCain was seen as a good )Tj
T*(pilot, albeit one who tended to "push the envelope" in his flying.[61] Promoted )Tj
T*(to lieutenant commander in January 1967,[58] McCain joined the aircraft carrier )Tj
T*(USSÂ Forrestal by May 1967,[58] flying Skyhawks with the VA-46 "Clansmen" )Tj
T*(squadron.[78]Forrestal conducted training exercises in the Atlantic throughout )Tj
T*(the spring, then set sail for the Pacific in June.[79] By this time, Jack )Tj
T*(McCain had risen in the ranks, making rear admiral in 1958 and vice admiral in )Tj
T*(1963;[80] in May 1967, he was promoted to four-star admiral, and became )Tj
T*(Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, stationed in London.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Vietnam operations )Tj
T*( On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin[79] )Tj
T*(and joined Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965â€“1968 air interdiction and )Tj
T*(strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.[70][81] The alpha strikes )Tj
T*(flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms )Tj
T*(depots, factories, and bridges.[82] They were quite dangerous, due to the )Tj
T*(strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and )Tj
T*(-supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet )Tj
T*(interceptors.[82] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went )Tj
T*(without incident,[83] and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, )Tj
T*(McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator.[64] McCain and his )Tj
T*(fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from )Tj
T*(Washington;[82] he later wrote, "The target list was so restricted that we had )Tj
T*(to go back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots )Tj
T*(flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless. In all )Tj
T*(candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have )Tj
T*(the least notion of what it took to win the war."[81] )Tj
T*( McCain was almost killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. While the air )Tj
T*(wing was preparing to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom )Tj
T*(accidentally fired across the carrier's deck.[84] The rocket struck either )Tj
T*(McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it.[79] The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's )Tj
T*(fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose.[85] McCain later )Tj
T*(said, "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere."[79] McCain )Tj
T*(escaped from his jet by climbing out the cockpit, working himself to the nose )Tj
T*(of the jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck.[85] His )Tj
T*(flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to )Tj
T*(put it out.[85] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when )Tj
T*(the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet \(three )Tj
T*(meters\)[86] and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by )Tj
T*(fragments.[61][79][87] McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard )Tj
T*(off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestal's ready room and with )Tj
T*(other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the )Tj
T*(room's closed-circuit television.[88] The fire killed 134Â sailors, injured )Tj
T*(scores of others, destroyed at least 20Â aircraft, and took 24Â hours to )Tj
T*(control.[79][89][90] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised )Tj
T*(the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on )Tj
T*(deck,[86] and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., "It's a difficult )Tj
T*(thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the )Tj
T*(people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff )Tj
T*(on North Vietnam."[91] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain )Tj
T*(added, "I always wanted to be in the Navy. I was born into it and I never )Tj
T*(really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the )Tj
T*(regimentation."[91] )Tj
T*( As Forrestal headed to port for repairs, McCain volunteered to join the )Tj

T*(one-third of their pilots were killed or captured, and all of their original )Tj
T*(fifteen A-4s had been destroyed.[94] After taking some leave in Europe and back )Tj
T*(home in Orange Park, Florida,[95] McCain joined Oriskany on September 30, )Tj
T*(1967,[94] for a tour he expected would finish early the next summer.[96] He )Tj
T*(volunteered to fly the squadron's most dangerous missions right away, rather )Tj
T*(than work his way up to them.[97] During October 1967, the pilots operated in )Tj
T*(constant twelve-hour on, twelve-hour off shifts.[98] McCain would be awarded a )Tj
T*(Navy Commendation Medal for leading his air section through heavy enemy fire )Tj
T*(during an October 18 raid on the Lac Trai shipyard in Haiphong.[99] On October )Tj
T*(25, McCain successfully attacked the Phuc Yen airfield north of Hanoi through a )Tj
T*(barrage of anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missile fire, which would )Tj
T*(garner him the Bronze Star.[99] Air defenses around Hanoi were then the )Tj
T*(strongest they would be during the entire war.[100] )Tj
T*( [edit] Prisoner of war )Tj
T*( [edit] Arrival )Tj
T*( On October 26, 1967, McCain was flying his twenty-third mission, part of a )Tj
T*(twenty-plane strike force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central )Tj
T*(Hanoi[101][102] that previously had almost always been off-limits to U.S. raids )Tj
T*(due to the possibility of collateral damage.[100] Arriving just before noon, )Tj
T*(McCain dove from 9,000 to 4,000 feet on his approach;[103] as he neared the )Tj
T*(target, warning systems in McCain's A-4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being )Tj
T*(tracked by enemy fire-control radar.[104] Like other U.S. pilots, he would not )Tj
T*(consider breaking off a bombing run,[61] and he held his dive until he released )Tj
T*(his bombs at about 3,500Â feet \(1,000Â m\).[105] As he started to pull up, the )Tj
T*(Skyhawk's wing was blown off by a Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft missile fired )Tj
T*(by the North Vietnamese Air Defense Command's 61st Battalion,[100][103] )Tj
T*(commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan[103] and with fire control officer Lieutenant )Tj
T*(Nguyen Xuan Dai.[100][103] \(McCain was later awarded the Distinguished Flying )Tj
T*(Cross for this day,[99] while Nguyen Xuan Dai was awarded the title Hero of the )Tj

T*(Trushechkin claimed that he had been the missile guidance officer who had shot )Tj
T*(McCain down.[106][107] In any case, the raid was a failure, as the power plant )Tj
T*(was not damaged and three of the Navy planes were shot down.[103]\) )Tj
T*( McCain's plane went into a vertical inverted spin.[109] Bailing out upside )Tj
T*(down at high speed,[110] the force of the ejection fractured McCain's right arm )Tj
T*(in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him )Tj
T*(unconscious.[110][111] McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into TrÃºc Báº¡ch )Tj
T*(Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he )Tj
T*(regained consciousness, he could not use his arms.[104] Eventually, he was able )Tj
T*(to inflate his life vest using his teeth.[104] Several Vietnamese, possibly led )Tj
T*(by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore.[112] A mob )Tj
T*(gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his )Tj
T*(left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his )Tj
T*(left foot and abdominal area.[104][110][111] He was then transported to Hanoi's )Tj
T*(main Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton" by American POWs.[113] )Tj
T*( McCain reached Hoa Lo in as bad a physical condition as any prisoner during )Tj

T*(McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship's name, squadron's name, and the )Tj
T*(attack's intended target.[118] This information, along with personal details of )Tj
T*(McCain's life and purported statements by McCain about the war's progress, )Tj
T*(would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese official newspaper )Tj
T*(NhÃ¢n DÃ¢n[103] as well as in dispatches from outlets such as the Cuban news )Tj
T*(agency Prensa Latina.[119] Disclosing the military information was in violation )Tj
T*(of the Code of Conduct, which McCain later wrote he regretted, although he saw )Tj
T*(the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese.[120] )Tj
T*(Further coerced to give future targets, he named cities that had already been )Tj
T*(bombed, and responding to demands for the names of his squadron's members, he )Tj
T*(supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line.[118][121] )Tj
T*( McCain spent six weeks in the hospital,[101] receiving marginal care in a )Tj
T*(dirty, wet environment.[122] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his )Tj
T*(right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful;[123] he received an )Tj
T*(operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm.[124] He )Tj
T*(was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, )Tj
T*(FranÃ§ois Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program )Tj
T*(Panorama in January 1968[125] and later in the U.S. on the CBS Evening )Tj
T*(News.[126] The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking )Tj
T*(cigarettes and speaking haltingly,[127] would become the most well-known images )Tj
T*(of McCain's imprisonment.[125] McCain was observed by a variety of North )Tj
T*(Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyá»…n TuÃ¢n and Defense )Tj
T*(Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Vo Nguyen Giap.[103][128] Many of )Tj
T*(the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America's )Tj
T*(political-military-economic elite.[129] Now having lost fifty pounds )Tj
T*(\(twenty-three kilograms\), in a chest cast, covered in grime and eyes full of )Tj
T*(fever, and with his hair turned white,[101] in early December 1967 McCain was )Tj
T*(sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed "the )Tj
T*(Plantation".[103][130] He was placed in a cell with George "Bud" Day, a badly )Tj
T*(injured and tortured Air Force pilot \(later awarded the Medal of Honor\) and )Tj
T*(Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live )Tj
T*(another week.[131][132] Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept )Tj
T*(him alive;[132] Day later remembered that McCain had "a fantastic will to )Tj
T*(live".[133] )Tj
T*( [edit] Solitary )Tj
T*( In March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement, where he remained for )Tj
T*(two years.[134] Unknown to the POWs, in April 1968, Jack McCain was named )Tj
T*(Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command \(CINCPAC\) effective in July, stationed in )Tj
T*(Honolulu and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater.[135][136] In )Tj
T*(mid-June, Major Bai, commander of the North Vietnamese prison camp system,[137] )Tj
T*(offered McCain a chance to return home early.[135] The North Vietnamese wanted )Tj
T*(to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful,[133] and also )Tj
T*(wanted to show other POWs that members of the elite like McCain were willing to )Tj
T*(be treated preferentially.[135] McCain turned down the offer of release, due to )Tj
T*(the POWs' "first in, first out" interpretation of the U.S. Code of )Tj
T*(Conduct:[138] he would only accept the offer if every man captured before him )Tj
T*(was released as well.[101][139] McCain's refusal to be released was remarked )Tj
T*(upon by North Vietnamese senior negotiator Le Duc Tho to U.S. envoy Averell )Tj
T*(Harriman, during the ongoing Paris Peace Talks.[140] Enraged by his declining )Tj
T*(of the offer, Bai and his assistant told McCain that things would get very bad )Tj
T*(for him.[139] )Tj
T*( In late August 1968, a program of vigorous torture methods began on )Tj
T*(McCain.[141] The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, )Tj
T*(painful positions and severely beat him every two hours, all while he was )Tj
T*(suffering from dysentery.[141] His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were )Tj
T*(cracked, some teeth were broken at the gumline, and his left arm was )Tj
T*(re-fractured.[33][141] Lying in his own waste, his spirit was broken;[141] the )Tj
T*(beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards.[101] After four days of )Tj

T*(air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to )Tj
T*(the doctors."[101][141] He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical )Tj
T*(language to signal that the statement was forced.[121] McCain was haunted then )Tj
T*(and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country, his family, his )Tj
T*(comrades and himself by his statement,[143][144] but as he later wrote, "I had )Tj
T*(learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had )Tj
T*(reached mine."[109] Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a )Tj
T*(second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused.[141] He sometimes )Tj
T*(received two to three beatings per week because of his continued )Tj
T*(resistance;[145] the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year.[133] His )Tj
T*(refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards, )Tj
T*(were often heard by other POWs.[132] His boxing experience from his Naval )Tj
T*(Academy days helped him withstand the battering,[43] and the North Vietnamese )Tj
T*(did not break him again.[141] )Tj
T*( Other American POWs were similarly tortured and maltreated in order to extract )Tj
T*("confessions" and propaganda statements.[146][147] Many, especially among those )Tj
T*(who had been captured earlier and imprisoned longer â€“ such as those in the )Tj
T*("Alcatraz Gang" â€“ endured even worse treatment than McCain.[148] Under extreme )Tj
T*(duress, virtually all the POWs eventually yielded something to their )Tj
T*(captors.[146][149] There were momentary exceptions: on one occasion, a guard )Tj
T*(surreptitiously loosened McCain's painful rope bindings for a night; when, )Tj
T*(months later, the guard later saw McCain on Christmas Day, he stood next to )Tj
T*(McCain and silently drew a cross in the dirt with his foot.[150] In October )Tj
T*(1968, McCain's isolation was partly relieved when Ernest C. Brace was placed in )Tj
T*(the cell next to him;[151] he taught Brace the tap code the prisoners used to )Tj
T*(communicate.[152] On Christmas Eve 1968, a church service for the POWs was )Tj
T*(staged for photographers and film cameras; McCain defied North Vietnamese )Tj
T*(instructions to be quiet, speaking out details of his treatment then shouting )Tj
T*("Fu-u-u-u-ck you, you son of a bitch!" and giving the finger whenever a camera )Tj
T*(was pointed at him.[153] McCain refused to meet with various anti-Vietnam War )Tj
T*(peace groups coming to Hanoi,[154] such as those led by David Dellinger, Tom )Tj
T*(Hayden, and Rennie Davis, not wanting to give either them or the North )Tj
T*(Vietnamese a propaganda victory based on his connection to his father.[109] )Tj
T*(McCain was still badly hobbled by his injuries, earning the nickname "Crip" )Tj
T*(among the other POWs,[155][156] but despite his physical condition, continued )Tj
T*(beatings and isolation, he was one of the key players in the Plantation's )Tj
T*(resistance efforts.[157] )Tj
T*( In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began publicly questioning )Tj
T*(North Vietnamese treatment of U.S. prisoners.[158] On June 5, 1969, a United )Tj
T*(Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any )Tj
T*(such mistreatment.[158] The broadcast used excerpts from McCain's forced )Tj
T*("confession" of a year before, including a statement where he said he had )Tj
T*(bombed "cities, towns and villages" and had received "very good medical )Tj
T*(treatment" as a prisoner.[158][159] In late 1969, treatment of McCain and the )Tj
T*(other POWs suddenly improved.[160][161] North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had )Tj
T*(died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards )Tj
T*(POWs.[160][160] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released )Tj
T*(that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were )Tj
T*(being subjected,[109] and the National League of Families of American Prisoners )Tj
T*(and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened )Tj
T*(awareness of the POWs' plight.[162] In December 1969, McCain was transferred )Tj
T*(back to the Hoa Lo "Hanoi Hilton";[163] his solitary confinement ended in March )Tj
T*(1970.[164] When the prisoners talked about what they wanted to do once they got )Tj

T*( [edit] Release )Tj
T*( McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, but )Tj
T*(conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they )Tj
T*(had been before.[109] Unbeknownst to them, each year that Jack McCain was )Tj
T*(CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in South Vietnam )Tj
T*(serving closest to the DMZ; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close )Tj
T*(to his son as he could get.[167] By 1971, some 30â€“50Â percent of the POWs had )Tj
T*(become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of )Tj
T*(military progress and what they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the )Tj
T*(U.S., and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for )Tj
T*(the North Vietnamese.[149] McCain was not among them: he participated in a )Tj
T*(defiant church service[168] and led an effort to write letters home that only )Tj
T*(portrayed the camp in a negative light,[169] and as a result spent much of the )Tj
T*(year in a camp reserved for "bad attitude" cases.[149] )Tj
T*( Back at the "Hanoi Hilton" from November 1971 onward,[170] McCain and the )Tj
T*(other POWs cheered the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972, )Tj
T*(whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were issued by )Tj
T*(Jack McCain, knowing his son was in the vicinity.[171] Jack McCain's tour as )Tj
T*(CINCPAC ended in September 1972,[172] despite his desire to have it extended so )Tj
T*(he could see the war to its conclusion.[167] The old-time POWs cheered even )Tj
T*(more during the intense "Christmas Bombing" campaign of December )Tj
T*(1972,[171][173] when Hanoi was subjected for the first time to repeated B-52 )Tj
T*(Stratofortress raids. Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the )Tj
T*(walls of the camp, scaring some of the newer POWs,[173] most saw it as a )Tj
T*(forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms.[171] )Tj
T*( The Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27, 1973, ending direct U.S. )Tj
T*(involvement in the war, but the Operation Homecoming arrangements for the 591Â )Tj
T*(American POWs took longer.[174] McCain was finally released from captivity on )Tj
T*(March 14, 1973, being taken by bus to Gia Lam Airport, transferred to U.S. )Tj
T*(custody, and flown by C-141 to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.[175][176] )Tj
T*( Altogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and )Tj
T*(a half years, nearly five of them after his refusal to accept the )Tj
T*(out-of-sequence repatriation offer. His wartime injuries left him permanently )Tj
T*(incapable of raising either arm more than 80Â degrees.[33][111] For his actions )Tj
T*(as a POW, McCain was awarded the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, three more )Tj
T*(instances of the Bronze Star, another instance of the Navy Commendation Medal, )Tj
T*(and the Purple Heart.[58][99] He also gained an appreciation, from experiencing )Tj
T*(the mutual help and organized resistance of the POWs, that his earlier )Tj
T*(individualism needed to be tempered by a belief in causes greater than )Tj
T*(self-interest.[144] )Tj
T*( [edit] Return to United States )Tj
T*( Upon his return to the United States a few days later, McCain was reunited )Tj
T*(with his wife Carol and his family.[177] She had suffered her own crippling, )Tj
T*(near-death ordeal during his captivity, due to an automobile accident in )Tj
T*(December 1969 that left her hospitalized for six months and facing twenty-three )Tj
T*(operations and ongoing physical therapy.[178] Businessman and POW advocate Ross )Tj
T*(Perot had paid for her medical care.[69] By the time McCain saw her, she was )Tj
T*(four inches \(ten centimeters\) shorter, on crutches, and substantially )Tj
T*(heavier.[69] As a returned POW, McCain became a celebrity of sorts: The New )Tj
T*(York Times ran a story and front-page photo of him getting off the plane at )Tj
T*(Clark Air Base in the Philippines;[175][179] he authored a thirteen-page cover )Tj
T*(story describing his ordeal and his support for the Nixon administration's )Tj
T*(handling of the war in U.S. News &amp; World Report;[109] he participated in )Tj
T*(parades in Orange Park and elsewhere and made personal appearances before )Tj
T*(groups, where he showed strong speaking skills;[177][180] he was given the key )Tj
T*(to the city of Jacksonville, Florida;[177] and a photograph of him on crutches )Tj

T*(Nancy Reagan,[183] and John McCain made a strong impression speaking at a large )Tj
T*(prayer breakfast hosted by the governor.[184] McCain had admired Ronald Reagan )Tj
T*(while in captivity and afterwards, believing him a man who saw honor in Vietnam )Tj
T*(service and a potential leader would not lead the nation into a war it was )Tj
T*(unwilling to win.[185] )Tj
T*( McCain underwent three operations and other treatment for his injuries,[186] )Tj
T*(spending three months at the Naval Regional Medical Center in )Tj
T*(Jacksonville.[58][187] Psychological tests, given to all the returning POWs, )Tj
T*(showed that McCain had "adjusted exceptionally well to repatriation" and had )Tj
T*("an ambitious, striving, successful pattern of adjustment".[188] McCain told )Tj
T*(examiners that he withstood his ordeal by having "Faith in country, United )Tj
T*(States Navy, family, and God".[189] Unlike many veterans, McCain did not )Tj
T*(experience flashbacks or nightmares of his Vietnam experience,[190] although )Tj
T*(due to the association with prison guards, the sound of keys rattling would )Tj
T*(cause him to "tense up".[111] )Tj
T*( McCain was promoted to commander effective July 1973[58] and attended the )Tj
T*(National War College in Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. during the 1973â€“1974 )Tj
T*(academic year.[191][192] There he intensively studied the history of Vietnam )Tj
T*(and the French and American wars there,[193] and wrote "The Code of Conduct and )Tj
T*(the Vietnam Prisoners of War", a long paper on the Vietnam POW experience as a )Tj
T*(test of the U.S. Code of Conduct.[194] By the time he graduated,[195] he )Tj
T*(concluded that mistakes by American political and military leaders had doomed )Tj
T*(the war effort.[193] He accepted the right of the anti-war movement in the U.S. )Tj
T*(to have exercised their freedom to protest, and he adopted a live-and-let-live )Tj
T*(attitude towards those who had evaded the draft.[193] Nor did the vast changes )Tj
T*(in American social mores that had taken place during his absence bother him, as )Tj
T*(it did many other former POWs.[182] McCain returned to Saigon in November )Tj
T*(1974;[196] he and a couple of other former POWs received the National Order of )Tj
T*(Vietnam, that country's highest honor.[190] He also spoke at the South )Tj
T*(Vietnamese war college, five months before Saigon fell.[196] McCain resolved )Tj
T*(not to become a "professional POW" but to move forward and rebuild his )Tj
T*(life.[193] Few thought McCain could fly again, but he was determined to try, )Tj
T*(and during this time he engaged in nine months of grueling, painful physical )Tj
T*(therapy, especially to get his knees to bend again.[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Commanding officer )Tj
T*( McCain recuperated just enough to pass his flight physical and have his flight )Tj
T*(status reinstated.[69] In August 1974, he was assigned to the Replacement Air )Tj
T*(Group VA-174 "Hellrazors".[58] This was an A-7 Corsair II training squadron )Tj
T*(located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville[197] and the largest )Tj
T*(aviation squadron in the Navy.[198] He became its executive officer in )Tj
T*(1975,[198] and on July 1, 1976, he was made VA-174's commanding )Tj
T*(officer.[197][199] This last assignment was controversial, as he did not have )Tj
T*(the required experience of having commanded a smaller squadron first[196] )Tj
T*(\(something that he now had too high a rank to do\).[200] While some senior )Tj
T*(officers resented McCain's presence as favoritism due to his father, junior )Tj
T*(officers rallied to him and helped him qualify for A-7 carrier landings.[69] )Tj
T*( As commanding officer, McCain relied upon a relatively unorthodox leadership )Tj
T*(style based upon the force of his personality.[201] He removed personnel he )Tj
T*(thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by )Tj
T*(establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men.[69][199][201] Dealing with )Tj
T*(limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages,[69][199] he was )Tj
T*(forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning )Tj
T*(to arrive into the unit.[201] McCain's leadership abilities were credited with )Tj
T*(improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its )Tj
T*(aircraft were able to fly.[69][199] Although some operational metrics declined )Tj
T*(during the period,[198][201] the pilot safety improved to the point of having )Tj
T*(zero accidents.[198][199] The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious )Tj

T*(1977,[197] the change of command ceremony was attended by his father and the )Tj
T*(rest of his family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac )Tj
T*(C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor )Tj
T*(in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.[196] )Tj
T*( During their time in Jacksonville, the McCains' marriage began to falter.[203] )Tj
T*(McCain had extramarital affairs;[203] he was seen with other women in social )Tj
T*(settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for )Tj
T*(womanizing.[201][204] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when )Tj
T*(he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and )Tj
T*(Naval Air Facility El Centro.[203] McCain later said, "My marriage's collapse )Tj
T*(was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to )Tj
T*(Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame )Tj
T*(was entirely mine."[205] His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not )Tj
T*(due to her accident or Vietnam and that "I attribute [the breakup of our )Tj
T*(marriage] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to )Tj
T*(anything else."[206] John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that )Tj
T*("Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a )Tj

T*(People who have been apart that much change."[206] )Tj
T*( [edit] Senate liaison, divorce, and second marriage )Tj
T*( McCain had thought about entering politics since his return from Vietnam,[23] )Tj
T*(although 1964 had been the only time in his life he had ever voted.[23] In )Tj
T*(1976, he briefly thought of running for the U.S. House of Representatives from )Tj
T*(Florida;[207] he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville, but was )Tj
T*(convinced by other Republican Party leaders that he did not have sufficient )Tj
T*(political experience, funding, or popular support to defeat longtime Democratic )Tj
T*(incumbent Charles E. Bennett.[23][184][208] He did work so hard for Ronald )Tj
T*(Reagan's 1976 Republican primary campaign that his base commander reprimanded )Tj
T*(him for being too politically active for his naval position.[201] )Tj
T*( As his tenure with VA-174 was ending, McCain was assigned to a low-profile )Tj
T*(desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command.[201][209]Chief of Naval )Tj
T*(Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of )Tj
T*(McCain's social talents,[209] and instead in July 1977 McCain was appointed to )Tj
T*(the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs[58] )Tj
T*(\(an assignment Jack McCain had once held\).[207] The office's role mostly )Tj
T*(consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among )Tj
T*(legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists.[209] McCain later said )Tj
T*(the liaison job represented "[my] real entry into the world of politics and the )Tj
T*(beginning of my second career as a public servant".[181] McCain's lively )Tj
T*(personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell )Tj
T*(Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff.[209] He )Tj
T*(also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he )Tj
T*(arranged entertaining side escapades.[210] McCain was influenced by senators of )Tj
T*(both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, )Tj
T*(the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.[210] During 1978 and )Tj
T*(1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional )Tj
T*(funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration )Tj
T*(and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr.[69][211] In August 1979, McCain was )Tj

T*(did not attend the wedding,[68][69] but after several years they reconciled )Tj
T*(with him and Cindy.[69][73] Carol McCain became a personal assistant to Nancy )Tj
T*(Reagan and later Director of the White House Visitors Office.[215] The Reagans )Tj
T*(were stunned by the divorce;[214] Nancy Reagan's relationship with John McCain )Tj
T*(turned cold for a while following it, but eventually the two renewed their )Tj
T*(friendship.[214][216] The same happened with most of McCain's other friends, )Tj
T*(who were eventually won over by the force of his personality and his frequent )Tj
T*(expressions of guilt over what had happened.[69] )Tj
T*( Around the end of 1980, McCain decided to retire from the Navy.[217] He had )Tj
T*(not been given a major sea command,[218] and his physical condition had )Tj
T*(deteriorated, causing him to fail the flight physical required for any carrier )Tj
T*(command position[184][219] \(in addition to his limited arm movement, certain )Tj
T*(weather would always cause him to walk with a limp\).[111] McCain thought he )Tj
T*(might make rear admiral, but probably not vice admiral, and never become a )Tj
T*(four-star admiral as his grandfather and father had been.[218] McCain later )Tj
T*(wrote that he did not anguish over his decision,[217] although it pained his )Tj
T*(mother, who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval )Tj
T*(ones.[184] He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress[210] and )Tj
T*(was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen knew, for a planned run at a )Tj
T*(House seat from Arizona.[69] In early 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. )Tj
T*(Lehman, who did not want to see McCain leave the liaison post, told McCain that )Tj
T*(he was still on the path to be selected for one-star rear admiral.[184] McCain )Tj
T*(told Lehman that he was leaving the Navy[184] and that he could "do more good" )Tj
T*(in Congress.[210] )Tj
T*( McCain retired with an effective date of April 1, 1981,[58] the rank of )Tj
T*(captain,[58] and a disability pension due to his wartime injuries.[220] For his )Tj
T*(service in the Senate liaison office, McCain was awarded a second instance of )Tj
T*(the Legion of Merit.[99] Jack McCain died on March 22, 1981.[221] On March 27, )Tj
T*(1981, McCain attended his father's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery, )Tj
T*(wearing his uniform for the last time before signing his discharge papers, and )Tj
T*(later that day flew to Phoenix with his wife Cindy to begin his new )Tj
T*(life.[18][221] )Tj
